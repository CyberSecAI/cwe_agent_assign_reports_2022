# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2021-41753

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-290 | Authentication Bypass by Spoofing | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-807 | Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing), is a base-level CWE that is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication). This indicates that the vulnerability involves a flaw in the authentication process, where an attacker can bypass authentication by spoofing certain aspects of the authentication exchange. The secondary CWE, CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision), suggests that the authentication mechanism relies on inputs that can be manipulated by an attacker.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of Wi-Fi frames**, specifically **SAE Commit frames** and **Authentication commit and confirm frames**. This leads to the **ability to spoof authentication frames** which in turn allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to **disconnect a wireless client**, resulting in a denial-of-service.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing) as the primary candidate, and CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision) as a secondary candidate. This assessment is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which highlight the **ability to spoof authentication frames** and the **reliance on potentially manipulated inputs** in the authentication process.

The evidence supporting CWE-290 includes:

*   "**specific spoofed SAE authentication frames**" - Vulnerability Description
*   "Sending a crafted SAE Commit frame using the MAC address of a connected device can cause disconnection." - CVE Reference Links Content Summary
*   "Crafting authentication confirm frames with invalid status codes can cause disconnections." - CVE Reference Links Content Summary
*   "Modifying the send value in authentication confirm frames can cause disconnections." - CVE Reference Links Content Summary

The evidence supporting CWE-807 includes:

*   "The root cause is a series of 8 security issues affecting the implementations of WPA3-SAE and WPA2 protocols within the chipset vendor's software development kit used in D-Link devices. These issues stem from **improper handling of various fields and states during the authentication and association processes of Wi-Fi connections**." - CVE Reference Links Content Summary

The final selection of CWE-290 as the primary weakness is based on its direct relevance to the **authentication bypass** achieved through spoofing. CWE-807 is included as a secondary weakness to acknowledge the **reliance on untrusted inputs** in the authentication decision, but it is less specific than CWE-290. Both CWEs are at the base level of abstraction, providing an appropriate level of detail for the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
To fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key
