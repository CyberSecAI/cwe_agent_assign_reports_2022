The vulnerability description clearly indicates that the issue arises from relying solely on client-side restrictions, which aligns directly with the definition of CWE-602. The other CWEs represent different facets of this primary weakness, with CWE-863 describing the nature of the authorization failure and CWE-425 highlighting the direct access vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe602[\"CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n\n    cwe602 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe288\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe424\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe602 primary\n    class cwe284,cwe863,cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses starts with the **Improper Access Control**, stemming from the **Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security**. This leads to the **Incorrect Authorization**, enabling **Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')**.\n  - Root Cause: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security (CWE-602)\n  - Weakness: Improper Access Control (CWE-284)\n  - Weakness: Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863)\n  - Impact: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') (CWE-425)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the **Improper Access Control** seemed like the right choice, but looking at the details of how the application was handling the access control, it became clear that the root cause was **Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security**.\n\nThe vulnerability description states \"guest role users can self-register even when the admin does not allow. This happens due to front-end restriction only.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" adds, \"The application only implements the restriction of user self-registration in the front-end, allowing bypassing by directly accessing the signup URL.\"\n\nThis evidence directly supports CWE-602 because the server relies on the client (front-end) to enforce the restriction, which is easily bypassed. CWE-284 is too general, and while it's related, CWE-602 pinpoints the exact mechanism causing the problem. CWE-863 is also relevant because the authorization check is performed incorrectly, but it's a consequence of the client-side enforcement. CWE-425 also applies as the attacker is directly requesting the signup URL, bypassing the intended access controls.\n\nTherefore, the selected CWEs provide the optimal level of specificity by focusing on the client-side enforcement as the primary weakness, with the others adding context to the access control and authorization failures.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
