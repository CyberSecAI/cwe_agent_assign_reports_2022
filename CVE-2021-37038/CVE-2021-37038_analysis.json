CWE-266 is a child of CWE-269 (Privilege Management) and can also be related to CWE-286 (Incorrect User Management), both related to privilege management issues. CWE-266 is more specific than CWE-284.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Privilege Management\"]\n\n    cwe266 -->|CHILDOF| cwe269\n    cwe266 -- CANALSOBE --> cwe286[\"CWE-286: Incorrect User Management\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe266 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper access control** (**WEAKNESS**) issue, which can lead to service confidentiality being affected.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identifies CWE-284 as the primary weakness, given the explicit mention of \"**improper access control**\" in both the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. However, CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, and the provided context suggests a more specific issue related to privilege management. Therefore, CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment), a Base-level CWE, is added as a secondary candidate because the root cause appears to be related to incorrect assignment of privilege which is creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\nThe decision to include CWE-266 is based on the evidence suggesting a privilege management issue and the goal of selecting a more specific CWE. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-266 is related to privilege management concepts and provides a finer-grained classification than CWE-284.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context
