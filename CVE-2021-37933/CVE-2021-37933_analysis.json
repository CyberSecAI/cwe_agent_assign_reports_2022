CWE-90 directly addresses the **LDAP injection** vulnerability described. CWE-287 and CWE-1390 represent the broader category of authentication issues that can arise from **LDAP injection**. CWE-90 CanPrecede CWE-287.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe90[\"CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe90 -->|ChildOf| cwe943\n    cwe1390 -->|ChildOf| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe90 primary\n    class cwe287,cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient server-side validation of the email parameter**, leading to **LDAP injection**, and ultimately resulting in the ability to bypass authentication.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference links, which clearly indicate an **LDAP injection** vulnerability due to **insufficient validation of the email parameter**.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description: \"An **LDAP injection** vulnerability in /account/login in Huntflow Enterprise before 3.10.6 could allow an unauthenticated, remote user to modify the logic of an LDAP query and bypass authentication. The vulnerability is due to **insufficient server-side validation of the email parameter** before using it to construct LDAP queries. An attacker could bypass authentication exploiting this vulnerability by sending login attempts in which there is a valid password but a wildcard character in email parameter.\"\n\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary:\n*   \"Root cause of vulnerability\": \"**Insufficient server-side validation of the email parameter** before using it to construct LDAP queries.\"\n*   \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present\": \"**LDAP injection** vulnerability.\"\n*   \"Impact of exploitation\": \"An unauthenticated, remote user can modify the logic of an LDAP query and bypass authentication.\"\n\nCWE-90 is the most specific and appropriate CWE because it directly addresses the **LDAP injection** vulnerability. While CWE-287 and CWE-1390 are related to authentication bypass, they are higher-level classifications.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n**Reason Not Used:** This CWE is not related to the described vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n**Reason Not Used:** While this is a parent of CWE-90, CWE-90 is more specific.\n\n## CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a query intended to access or manipulate data in a data store such as a database, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended logic of the query.\n**Reason Not Used:** While this is a parent of CWE-90, CWE-90 is more specific.\n\n## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.\n**Reason Not Used:** This CWE is not related to the described vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an LDAP query using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended LDAP query when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
