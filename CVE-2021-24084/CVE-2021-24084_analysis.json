CWE-213 is a child of CWE-200, making it a more specific classification. However, since CWE-213 is being considered for deprecation, CWE-200 could be considered as a potential candidate as well.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe213[\"CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe213 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe213 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves an information exposure (**impact: Information Disclosure**) due to an issue within Windows Mobile Device Management. The specific root cause is not detailed in the description, but the exposure of sensitive information is the main weakness.\n- Initial Flaw: Incompatible policies or mishandling of sensitive information within Windows Mobile Device Management.\n- Impact: Exposure of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the vulnerability as an Information Disclosure issue within Windows Mobile Device Management. The key phrase \"impact: Information Disclosure\" directly supports this. The Retriever Results suggested CWE-213 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies) as a strong candidate due to its high density score.\n\nBased on the provided evidence, CWE-213 is the optimal level of specificity. The vulnerability involves the exposure of information, and CWE-213 directly addresses situations where sensitive information is exposed due to incompatible policies. The description of CWE-213 mentions considering whether information is regarded as sensitive by different stakeholders, such as users or administrators, which aligns with the general idea of device management having policies about what information is exposed. The fact that CWE-213 is being considered for deprecation lowers the confidence in this assessment slightly. Also, the evidence is lacking in that the description is very high level.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered but not chosen as the primary CWE because it is more general. While it accurately describes the impact, it doesn't capture the nuance of incompatible policies as explicitly as CWE-213 does. CWE-200 is also discouraged for use per its mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
