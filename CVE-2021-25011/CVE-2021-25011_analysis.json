This is a child of **CWE-285 [Improper Authorization]** and **CWE-284 [Improper Access Control]**, but **CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]** is more specific. The secondary weakness is **CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]**, which is a compound weakness that occurs when the application **does not verify if a request was intentionally provided by the user**. The relationships between these CWEs are as follows:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe346\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe441\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe642\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe613\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe352 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** and **missing CSRF protection**, which leads to the ability for any authenticated user to delete arbitrary posts and update plugin settings.\n  - The root cause is the **lack of authorization** which leads to the impact of deleting posts and updating settings.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **missing authorization** (**CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]**) and **missing CSRF protection** (**CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]**) as the primary weaknesses.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that the plugin **does not have proper authorisation and CSRF** in most of its AJAX actions, allowing authenticated users to delete arbitrary posts and update plugin settings. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating that the plugin lacked proper authorization and CSRF protection for its AJAX actions.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that **CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]** is a child of **CWE-285 [Improper Authorization]** and **CWE-284 [Improper Access Control]**, making it a more specific classification.\n**CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]** is a compound weakness that requires other weaknesses to be present, such as **CWE-346 [Origin Validation Error]**, **CWE-441 [Unintended Proxy or Intermediary (Versioning Issues)]**, **CWE-642 [Externalization of Internal Data]**, and **CWE-613 [Insufficient Session Expiration]**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the **rootcause** of the vulnerability, which is the **missing authorization** and **missing CSRF protection**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
