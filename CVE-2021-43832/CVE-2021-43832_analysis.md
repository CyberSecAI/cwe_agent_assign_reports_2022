# Analysis for CVE-2021-43832

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.8 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-306, which is a base-level CWE. It is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), a class-level CWE. CWE-863 is a Class-level CWE, which is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). CWE-284 is a Pillar-level CWE, and thus is very general. CWE-306 is more specific and is a better fit.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper permissions**, which leads to missing authentication for pipeline creation and execution. This allows an arbitrary user to create and execute pipelines, potentially leading to remote execution and access to deploy resources.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial vulnerability description mentions "**improper permissions**" as the root cause, leading to pipeline creation and execution without authentication. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides more details: "An incorrect wildcard match for the favorite icon in Spinnaker leads to **improper permissions**, allowing pipeline creation and execution by unauthenticated users." This confirms that the root cause is related to **improper permissions** and a lack of authentication.

CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is the best fit because the vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to create and execute pipelines, which are critical functions. The description of CWE-306, "The product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources," aligns perfectly with the vulnerability.

CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a secondary candidate because while authorization might be in place, it's not correctly configured, as indicated by the "**improper permissions**". However, the primary issue is the lack of authentication, making CWE-306 the more accurate classification.

The decision is based on both the initial vulnerability description and the additional details provided in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-306 is more specific than its parent CWE-287 (Improper Authentication).

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges 
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 5326.33
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access
