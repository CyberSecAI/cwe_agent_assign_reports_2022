# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-3850

## Vulnerability Description
Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness in GitHub repository adodb/adodb prior to 5.20.21.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **authentication bypass**
- **product:** adodb/adodb
- **version:** prior to 5.20.21

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3850:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the `adodb_addslashes()` function in the ADOdb library for PHP, specifically within the `drivers/adodb-postgres64.inc.php` file. This function failed to properly escape connection parameters, allowing an attacker to inject malicious values when those parameters were wrapped in single quotes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Improper input sanitization:** The `adodb_addslashes()` function did not correctly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in the PostgreSQL connection string.
- **Authentication bypass:** By injecting specially crafted values into the connection string, attackers could bypass the intended authentication process.
- **Injection vulnerability:** The vulnerability allows for SQL injection or similar attacks by manipulating parameters like username, password, or database name.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Authentication bypass:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the PostgreSQL database server.
- **Server information disclosure:** Depending on how the library is used, an attacker could potentially obtain the server's IP address or other sensitive information.
- **Data breaches/manipulation:** With access to the database, an attacker could potentially read, modify, or delete data.
- **Unspecified impact:** The provided content notes "other unspecified impact" is possible, highlighting the severity of the issue.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, as it involves manipulating connection parameters to a database server.
- **Malicious Input:**  Attackers can provide a malicious string via the connection parameters to `ADOConnection::connect()` or similar functions (`nConnect()`, `pConnect()`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to control connection parameters:** Attackers need to be able to influence the parameters that are passed to the ADOdb library when establishing a PostgreSQL connection, such as the username, password, or database name. This could be achieved through user input fields in a web application that are not properly sanitized.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable library:** Attackers need to know that the ADOdb library is being used and that it is vulnerable.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Emmet Leahy of Sorcery Ltd.
- The fix involves removing the flawed `adodb_addslashes()` function and replacing it with  `addcslashes()` to escape only `'` and `\`, and building the connection string with an array and a loop, as per `pg_connect()` documentation.
- Patches are available in ADOdb versions 5.20.21 and 5.21.4 or later.
- Debian has issued security advisories (DSA-5101-1 and DLA-2912-1) addressing this vulnerability.

This detailed breakdown provides a comprehensive view of the vulnerability, its root cause, potential impact, and mitigation strategies, based on the various sources provided.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed as the result of a separate weakness that is primary to the authentication error.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1390

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Most "authentication bypass" errors are resultant, not primary.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-1374:** The provided password is only compared against the first character of the real password.
- **CVE-2000-0979:** The password is not properly checked, which allows remote attackers to bypass access controls by sending a 1-byte password that matches the first character of the real password.
- **CVE-2001-0088:** Chain: Forum software does not properly initialize an array, which inadvertently sets the password to a single character, allowing remote attackers to easily guess the password and gain administrative privileges.




## CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs authentication based on the name of a resource being accessed, or the name of the actor performing the access, but it does not properly check all possible names for that resource or actor.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1390

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Overlaps equivalent encodings, canonicalization, authorization, multiple trailing slash, trailing space, mixed case, and other equivalence issues.

**[Theoretical]** Alternate names are useful in data driven manipulation attacks, not just for authentication.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-0317:** Protection mechanism that restricts URL access can be bypassed using URL encoding.
- **CVE-2004-0847:** Bypass of authentication for files using "\" (backslash) or "%5C" (encoded backslash).




## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description
Most languages and protocols have their own special elements such as characters and reserved words. These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < ("less than") as meaning "read input from a file".

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-707

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness can be related to interpretation conflicts or interaction errors in intermediaries (such as proxies or application firewalls) when the intermediary's model of an endpoint does not account for protocol-specific special elements.

**[Relationship]** See this entry's children for different types of special elements that have been observed at one point or another. However, it can be difficult to find suitable CVE examples. In an attempt to be complete, CWE includes some types that do not have any associated observed example.

**[Research Gap]** This weakness is probably under-studied for proprietary or custom formats. It is likely that these issues are fairly common in applications that use their own custom format for configuration files, logs, meta-data, messaging, etc. They would only be found by accident or with a focused effort based on an understanding of the format.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-0677:** Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.
- **CVE-2000-0703:** Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.
- **CVE-2003-0020:** Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.




## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
