This is a clear case of **missing authorization**, as the plugin does not verify the user's permissions before allowing access to the private posts titles.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states: \"The Find My Blocks WordPress plugin before 3.4.0 does not have authorisation checks in its REST API, which could allow unauthenticated users to enumerate private posts titles.\"\n\nThe **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms the root cause: \"The Find My Blocks plugin lacks authorization checks in its REST API.\" The impact is also clear: \"An unauthenticated attacker can enumerate the titles of private posts.\"\n\nCWE-862 **Missing Authorization** is the most appropriate CWE, as it directly reflects the **lack of authorization checks** in the REST API. The description of CWE-862 states: \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\" This aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-200 **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** is a secondary consideration, as the impact of the **missing authorization** is the **exposure of private posts titles** to unauthenticated users. However, CWE-200 is a high-level class and is often misused to represent the loss of confidentiality. Therefore, it is not the primary CWE, but it is a relevant secondary consideration.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The relationship analysis and mapping guidance also support this decision. The confidence in this mapping is high (0.8).",
