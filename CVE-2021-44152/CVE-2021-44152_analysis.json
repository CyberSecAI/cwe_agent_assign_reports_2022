CWE-620 (Unverified Password Change) is a child of CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication). CWE-306 and CWE-620 can be related where a missing authentication mechanism (CWE-306) leads to a password change function that does not require verification of the original password (CWE-620).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe620[\"CWE-620: Unverified Password Change\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe620 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** for the `/goform/change_password_process` endpoint (CWE-306). This **lack of authentication** leads to the ability to change any user's password without verification (CWE-620), ultimately resulting in unauthorized access to user accounts.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the fact that an unauthenticated user can change any existing user password.\nThe core of the vulnerability is the **missing authentication** for a critical function, namely changing a password. The vulnerability description states: \"Because /goform/change_password_process **does not verify authentication or authorization**, an unauthenticated user can change the password of any existing user.\" This directly points to CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function).\n\nCWE-620 (Unverified Password Change) is also applicable as a secondary weakness, highlighting that the password change process itself **lacks verification**. However, the primary issue is the **missing authentication** that allows an unauthenticated user to reach the password change functionality in the first place.\n\nThe relationship graph shows how these CWEs are connected, further solidifying the choice of CWE-306 as the primary cause and CWE-620 as a related secondary issue. Both are at the Base level of abstraction, offering specificity.\n\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) were considered but deemed less specific than CWE-306. CWE-306 directly addresses the core issue of **missing authentication**, whereas the others are broader classes.\n\nThe selection of CWE-306 and CWE-620 is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description and the supporting information from the retriever results and CWE specifications.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n*Not Selected*: While untrusted input is involved, the primary issue is the missing authentication, not the reliance on the input itself.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n*Not Selected*: The description indicates **missing authentication**, not an incorrect implementation.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n*Not Selected*: The vulnerability focuses on the lack of authentication for changing passwords, rather than authorization bypass through a user-controlled key.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n*Not Selected*: Although related, the vulnerability is more specifically about the absence of authentication for a critical function.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n*Not Selected*: This is not about privilege handling but rather about **missing authentication**.\n\n## CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts within a short time frame.\n*Not Selected*: This vulnerability is about a **missing authentication** mechanism, not restrictions on authentication attempts.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n*Not Selected*: The vulnerability does not involve weak credentials but rather **missing authentication**.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
