CWE-122 (**Heap-based Buffer Overflow**) is a more specific variant of out-of-bounds write, specifically occurring on the heap. CWE-190 (**Integer Overflow or Wraparound**) can precede CWE-787, as it can lead to an undersized buffer allocation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe190,cwe122 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)** leading to an insufficient buffer allocation. This is followed by **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)**, where data is written beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries, causing a **heap buffer overflow**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description, identified a **heap buffer overflow** due to an integer overflow.\n\nThe evidence from the CVE reference links content summary supports this:\n*   \"A **heap-buffer-overflow** vulnerability exists in the `fx_ArrayBuffer` function within the Moddable SDK's `xsDataView.c` file. This occurs due to an **integer overflow** when calculating the size of the ArrayBuffer, leading to a large allocation size.\"\n*   \"A buffer is allocated with an insufficient size due to **integer overflow** during size calculation when creating an ArrayBuffer, then a large amount of data is written to the undersized buffer which causes a write out of bounds and corrupts the heap.\"\n\nThe primary CWE is **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)**, as the core issue is writing data beyond the allocated buffer. **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)** is a contributing factor, leading to the incorrect buffer size calculation. **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)** is the consequence of the out-of-bounds write occurring on the heap.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause (**CWE-190**, **CWE-787**) and the specific type of buffer overflow (**CWE-122**).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
