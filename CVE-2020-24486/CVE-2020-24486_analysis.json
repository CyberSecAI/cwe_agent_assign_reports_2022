However, the provided information does not offer enough detail to pinpoint a more specific weakness. Therefore, while acknowledging the general guidance, CWE-20 is chosen as the best fit given the available evidence.\n\nThe retriever results list several other CWEs, including CWE-691, CWE-1288, and CWE-1173, but these are not as directly supported by the provided evidence as CWE-20.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly.\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider lower-level children such as Improper Use of Validation Framework (CWE-1173) or improper validation involving specific types or properties of input such as Specified Quantity (CWE-1284); Specified Index, Position, or Offset (CWE-1285); Syntactic Correctness (CWE-1286); Specified Type (CWE-1287); Consistency within Input (CWE-1288); or Unsafe Equivalence (CWE-1289).\n\n### Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis and resulting conclusion are heavily based on the explicit evidence provided in the vulnerability description and key phrases. While the MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-20 when more specific CWEs are available, the lack of detailed information prevents a more precise classification. The decision to use CWE-20 is justified by the direct mention of **improper input validation** as the root cause of the denial-of-service vulnerability.\n\nCWE-1173 (Improper Use of Validation Framework), CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input), CWE-1288 (Improper Validation of Consistency within Input), and CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management) were considered. However, the provided vulnerability description does not give enough information to support using them, because it does not specify *how* the input validation was improper, nor does it suggest any control flow problems.",
