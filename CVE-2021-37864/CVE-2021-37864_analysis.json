CWE-863 is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), indicating a more general authorization issue. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a potential impact of this authorization failure, where unauthorized users can view the contents of archived channels. It is a child of CWE-668. The relationship shows the progression of the vulnerability from a root cause (authorization failure) to an impact (information exposure).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe863 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient validation of permissions** (CWE-863). This leads to authenticated users being able to bypass intended restrictions and **view the contents of archived channels** (CWE-200). The root cause is the authorization failure, and the impact is the information exposure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the analysis focused on the primary **rootcause** identified in the vulnerability description: \"**fails to sufficiently validate permissions while viewing archived channels**.\" This pointed strongly towards an authorization-related issue. The Retriever Results and Complete CWE Specifications were then examined to determine the most appropriate CWE.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **failure to sufficiently validate permissions**. The vulnerability description states that authenticated users can bypass intended restrictions, which aligns with the definition of CWE-863. The MITRE mapping guidance suggests that CWE-863 is a Class-level CWE and that more specific Base-level CWEs might be available. However, in this case, the description doesn't give much more information to choose a more specific base CWE.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered as a potential secondary CWE. While the **impact** of the vulnerability is that users can view the contents of archived channels, CWE-200 is discouraged by MITRE as it represents a technical impact rather than a root cause. However, it is included as a secondary CWE to capture the information exposure aspect of the vulnerability.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity based on the available evidence. More specific CWEs would require more detailed information about the specific type of authorization failure, which is not provided in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
