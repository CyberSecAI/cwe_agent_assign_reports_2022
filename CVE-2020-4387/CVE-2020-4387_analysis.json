A local user exploits this to **obtain sensitive information**.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-367 Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n  - **Weakness:** CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') or CWE-61 UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\n  - **Impact:** Information Disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis indicated a **race condition of a symbolic link**. The primary focus was to identify the CWE that best represents this **race condition** and its relationship with symbolic links.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **race condition of a symbolic link** which leads to sensitive information disclosure. The phrase \"*race condition of a symbolic link*\" is a direct quote from the \"**Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**\". The \"**CVE Reference Links Content Summary**\" also states the \"*Root cause of vulnerability: A race condition involving a symbolic link could allow a local user to obtain sensitive information.*\"\n\nCWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) is the most accurate representation of the **root cause**, as it describes a scenario where the state of a resource changes between the check and the use, leading to unexpected actions. The involvement of a symbolic link makes CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')) and CWE-61 (UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following) relevant, since the **race condition** allows the symbolic link to be exploited. CWE-363 (Race Condition Enabling Link Following) is also relevant.\n\nWhile CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) could apply as a general case of a race condition, CWE-367 is more specific to the TOCTOU scenario described in the vulnerability.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-367 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) and accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere.
