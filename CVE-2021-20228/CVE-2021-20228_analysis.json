The `no_log` feature failed to protect sensitive information in sub-options of the `basic.py` module in Ansible Engine 2.9.18, leading to the inclusion of sensitive information in the sent data. |\n| CWE-532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE.  Although the primary issue is the transmission of sensitive data, the fact that the `no_log` feature failed suggests the sensitive information might also end up in logs. |\n| CWE-226 | Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The sensitive information was not properly cleared or masked after being used in the sub-options, potentially leading to it being exposed in other contexts or reused resources.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the selection is the hierarchical connection between CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) and its child CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data). CWE-201 is more specific and accurately reflects the vulnerability where sensitive information is inserted into sent data due to the failure of the `no_log` feature.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe226[\"CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe226 -->|CHILDOF| cwe212\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe532,cwe226 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** implementation of the `no_log` feature, leading to sensitive information not being masked by default. This results in the **insertion** of sensitive information into sent data, which can then lead to an attacker obtaining sensitive information, impacting confidentiality.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-201 because the core issue is the **insertion** of sensitive information into sent data due to the **failure** of the `no_log` feature. The supporting evidence is strong, as the CVE description and summary explicitly state that sensitive information is not masked and can be obtained by an attacker due to this **failure**.\n\nThe evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section:\n\"The `no_log` feature in Ansible's `basic.py` module did not mask sensitive information when using sub-options, particularly when fallback values or defaults were used.\"\n\"An attacker could obtain sensitive information that was not properly masked or protected, leading to a breach of confidentiality.\"\n\nCWE-200 was considered but deemed too general. While the vulnerability does lead to exposure of sensitive information, the root cause is specifically the insertion of this information into sent data, making CWE-201 a more precise fit.\n\nCWE-532 was considered because the `no_log` feature's failure could also result in sensitive information being logged, but this is a secondary concern and not the primary mode of exposure.\n\nCWE-226 was considered since the issue involves the state after sensitive data is used, but it is not a primary factor.\n\nThe selection of CWE-201 at the Base level of abstraction is optimal because it accurately represents the specific weakness of sensitive information being inserted into sent data, providing a clear and actionable classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context
