## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing initialization** of the `sockaddr_qrtr` structure. This leads to the **use of an uninitialized resource** when data is copied to userspace, resulting in **information disclosure**.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states the root cause as a "**partially uninitialized data structure**" within the `qrtr_recvmsg` function, leading to potential information disclosure. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the `sockaddr_qrtr` structure is not properly initialized, and uninitialized kernel memory is copied to user space.

Based on the evidence, CWE-908, **Use of Uninitialized Resource**, is the most appropriate primary CWE. It aligns directly with the root cause described in the vulnerability details. The **Retriever Results** also list CWE-908 as a potential candidate.

CWE-909, **Missing Initialization of Resource**, and CWE-665, **Improper Initialization**, were also considered since they relate to the initialization issue. However, the vulnerability description emphasizes the *use* of the uninitialized data, making CWE-908 the more accurate and specific choice. The graph relationships show these CWEs are related, however, the root cause is the uninitialized resource being used.

The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-908 is a Base-level CWE, providing a detailed representation of the weakness. The other CWEs are Class-level, representing broader categories.

Relevant CWE Information:
- **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** "**partially uninitialized data structure**"
- **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** "fails to properly initialize a `sockaddr_qrtr` structure before copying kernel data to userspace. This structure has a 2-byte hole which is not being cleared, potentially exposing uninitialized data in kernel memory to user-space processes."

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-29647

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.11. qrtr_recvmsg in net/qrtr/qrtr.c allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory because of a **partially uninitialized data structure**, aka CID-50535249f624.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **partially uninitialized data structure**
- **impact:** information disclosure
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **version:** before 5.11.11
- **component:** qrtr_recvmsg in net/qrtr/qrtr.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-29647:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an information leak within the Qualcomm IPC Router (qrtr) implementation in the Linux kernel. The `qrtr_recvmsg` function, responsible for receiving messages, fails to properly initialize a `sockaddr_qrtr` structure before copying kernel data to userspace. This structure has a 2-byte hole which is not being cleared, potentially exposing uninitialized data in kernel memory to user-space processes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The core vulnerability is an information leak. Due to the lack of initialization of the `sockaddr_qrtr` structure, uninitialized kernel memory is copied to user space, potentially revealing sensitive information.
- **Uninitialized Data:** The root cause is the lack of proper handling of an uninitialized data structure in `qrtr_recvmsg`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information from kernel memory. The exact nature and value of the leaked data would vary depending on system activity and memory layout.
- The protocol in question is not enabled by default in Debian's official kernel configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**

- This vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted message to the Qualcomm IPC Router which makes its way to the vulnerable `qrtr_recvmsg()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to interact with the Qualcomm IPC Router (qrtr) and send crafted messages. This likely requires the attacker to have some level of access to the system and the ability to use the qrtr interface.
- Local access is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability, remote exploitation is not explicitly described, but could potentially be possible if the qrtr interface is exposed to the network.

**Additional notes:**
- The fix involves adding a `memset` to zero-out the `sockaddr_qrtr` structure before copying the data to the user.
- This vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions prior to the fix.
- The provided content also shows that this vulnerability was fixed in Fedora 32, 33 and 34 as well as Debian 9.

## CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results.

### Extended Description
In some languages such as C and C++, stack variables are not initialized by default. They generally contain junk data with the contents of stack memory before the function was invoked. An attacker can sometimes control or read these contents. In other languages or conditions, a variable that is not explicitly initialized can be given a default value that has security implications, depending on the logic of the program. The presence of an uninitialized variable can sometimes indicate a typographic error in the code.

### Alternative Terms

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2008-3688:** Chain: A denial of service may be caused by an uninitialized variable (CWE-457) allowing an infinite loop (CWE-835) resulting from a connection to an unresponsive server.
- **CVE-2008-0081:** Uninitialized variable leads to code execution in popular desktop application.




## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Often, indexable resources such as memory buffers or files can be accessed using a specific position, index, or offset, such as an index for an array or a position for a file. When untrusted input is not properly validated before it is used as an index, attackers could access (or attempt to access) unauthorized portions of these resources. This could be used to cause buffer overflows, excessive resource allocation, or trigger unexpected failures. 


### Alternative Terms

## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.

### Extended Description


While the product might limit the amount of memory that is allocated in a single operation for a single object (such as a malloc of an array), if an attacker can cause multiple objects to be allocated in separate operations, then this might cause higher total memory consumption than the developer intended, leading to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms
Stack Exhaustion: When a weakness allocates excessive memory on the stack, it is often described as "stack exhaustion," which is a technical impact of the weakness. This technical impact is often encountered as a consequence of CWE-789 and/or CWE-1325.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is not always a buffer overflow. For example, an off-by-one error could be a factor in a partial comparison, a read from the wrong memory location, an incorrect conditional, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-0252:** Off-by-one error allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via requests that do not contain newlines.
- **CVE-2001-1391:** Off-by-one vulnerability in driver allows users to modify kernel memory.
- **CVE-2002-0083:** Off-by-one error allows local users or remote malicious servers to gain privileges.




## CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.

### Extended Description
This is often triggered by improper handling of malformed data or unexpectedly interrupted sessions. In some languages, developers are responsible for tracking memory allocation and releasing the memory. If there are no more pointers or references to the memory, then it can no longer be tracked and identified for release.

### Alternative Terms
Memory Leak

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-772
ChildOf -> CWE-404
ChildOf -> CWE-404

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is often a resultant weakness due to improper handling of malformed data or early termination of sessions.

**[Terminology]** "memory leak" has sometimes been used to describe other kinds of issues, e.g. for information leaks in which the contents of memory are inadvertently leaked (CVE-2003-0400 is one such example of this terminology conflict).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-3119:** Memory leak because function does not free() an element of a data structure.
- **CVE-2004-0427:** Memory leak when counter variable is not decremented.
- **CVE-2002-0574:** chain: reference count is not decremented, leading to memory leak in OS by sending ICMP packets.
