It has child CWEs that might be more specific, but the provided information does not give enough details to specify a more granular CWE. CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE that is a child of CWE-664. It is considered as a secondary CWE since the vulnerability leads to denial of service.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n    \n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe664 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with **improper access control** (CWE-284), which allows authenticated users to lock files of other users, leading to a temporary **denial of service** (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)** as the primary weakness, as it is the direct cause of the vulnerability, enabling authenticated users to lock files belonging to other users. The vulnerability description clearly states that the root cause is **improper access control**.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section indicates the following:\n- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Nextcloud End-to-End Encryption app allowed any authenticated users to lock files of other users due to **improper access controls**.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: **Improper access control** (CWE-284)\n- **Impact of exploitation**: Temporary denial of service attack. Authenticated users could lock other users' files.\n\nThe \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section includes:\n- **impact:** lock files of other users\n- **attacker:** any authenticated users\n\nThe retriever results also indicate potentially relevant CWEs such as **CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key)** and **CWE-862 (Missing Authorization)**, but **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)** is more fitting because the issue is not a complete bypass or missing authorization, but rather **incorrect control** that allows unintended actions.\n\nWhile **CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption)** is listed in the Retriever Results and the impact leads to denial of service, it is a secondary impact. The primary weakness is still the **improper access control** that allows the resource consumption to occur.\n\nI am making the following adjustments based on the analysis:\n\n- Selecting **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)** as the primary CWE due to the explicit mention of **improper access controls** as the root cause in the provided text.\n- Including **CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption)** as a secondary CWE due to the denial-of-service impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
