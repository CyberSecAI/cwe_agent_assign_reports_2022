This CWE is related to improper handling of XML external entities, which aligns with the **missing XML validation** that leads to XXE attacks. CWE-611 is a child of CWE-610 (Insufficient or Missing Access Control API). CWE-20 was considered as a secondary CWE as the description refers to **missing XML validation**, but it is a high level Class.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe611[\"CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\"]\n    cwe610[\"CWE-610: Insufficient or Missing Access Control API\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe611 -->|CHILDOF| cwe610\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe611 primary\n    class cwe610,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing XML validation** (CWE-611), leading to the ability to submit specially crafted XML. This allows an attacker to read arbitrary files (confidentiality impact) or cause the system to crash (availability impact).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-611 as the primary weakness due to the **missing XML Validation** and the ability to submit a specially crafted XML file.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is:\n\"because of **missing XML Validation**, this vulnerability enables attacker to fully compromise confidentiality by allowing them to read any file on the filesystem or fully compromise availability by causing the system to crash\"\n\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary is:\n\"Due to the lack of validation of external entities, an authenticated attacker is able to submit specially crafted XML and compromise the integrity (by reading files of the OS) and the availability (by causing process to crash).\"\n\nThe retriever results and vulnerability description clearly points to CWE-611 as the primary root cause. The graph relationships confirm that CWE-611 is a child of CWE-610, making it a more specific and appropriate choice than the higher-level CWE-20.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\nCWE-611 is the most specific CWE based on the description of the vulnerability, fitting the base level of abstraction.\nCWE-20 is a class level CWE and is not the optimal level of specificity.\nCWE-611 is the base level CWE and the most accurate representation of the **missing XML validation** weakness.",
