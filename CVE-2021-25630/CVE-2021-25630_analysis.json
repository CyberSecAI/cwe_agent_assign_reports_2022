It has a hierarchical relationship with CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). CWE-250, Execution with Unnecessary Privileges, is related to CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) and CWE-657 (Improper Neutralization for Individual Output Elements). The choice of CWE-863 as the primary is based on the fact that the **incorrect check** directly led to an authorization bypass. CWE-250 is considered as a secondary CWE as the vulnerable code runs with higher privileges than required which amplifies the consequences of the **incorrect check**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe250[\"CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe657[\"CWE-657: Improper Neutralization for Individual Output Elements\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe250 -->|CHILDOF| cwe269\n    cwe250 -->|CHILDOF| cwe657\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe250 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe269,cwe657 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect user check** (CWE-863). Due to this flaw, a normal user is able to execute `loolforkit` with elevated privileges which results in the ability to load arbitrary shared libraries leading to code execution. The fact that `loolforkit` runs with higher privileges than needed (CWE-250) only amplifies the impact, making the arbitrary code execution lead to local root privilege escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified several candidate CWEs, including CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges), and others related to file access and privilege management.\n\nThe primary choice, CWE-863, is supported by the vulnerability description's mention of a \"**wrong check**\" that leads to the bypass of intended authorization. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" highlights that the `loolforkit` program's user check could be bypassed. This **incorrect authorization** is the root cause that allows a normal user to execute the program with elevated privileges.\n\nCWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges) is a secondary consideration. The program runs with elevated privileges which amplifies the consequences of the authorization bypass (CWE-863) by allowing arbitrary code execution with root privileges.\n\nThe relationship analysis confirms that CWE-863 is a more direct and specific representation of the **incorrect authorization** in `loolforkit` than the other candidates.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-863 being a Class and CWE-250 being a Base.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.464\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with \"privilege escalation,\" which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** If an error or mistake allows privilege escalation, then use the CWE ID for that mistake. Avoid using CWE-269 when only phrases such as \"privilege escalation\" or \"gain privileges\" are available, as these indicate technical impact of the vulnerability - not the root cause weakness. If the root cause seems to be directly related to privileges, then examine the children of CWE-269 for additional hints, such as Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250) or Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.366\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
