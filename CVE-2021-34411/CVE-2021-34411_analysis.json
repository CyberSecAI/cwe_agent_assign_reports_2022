It has two parents: CWE-269 and CWE-657. CWE-269 is Improper Privilege Management which is too high level and discouraged. CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource is a class level CWE and a child of CWE-285 and CWE-668. While there may be a component of incorrect permissions, the root cause is the unnecessary privileges being executed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe250[\"CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe657[\"CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe250 -->|CHILDOF| cwe269\n    cwe250 -->|CHILDOF| cwe657\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe250 primary\n    class cwe732,cwe269 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe **root cause** is the application executing with elevated privileges when it is not necessary. This allows an attacker to launch Internet Explorer with elevated privileges, leading to a local privilege escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates that the Zoom Rooms installer, when launched with elevated privileges, allows launching Internet Explorer with those same elevated privileges. This **unnecessary execution** at a higher privilege level is the core weakness.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges). The description of CWE-250 states: \"The product performs an operation at a privilege level that is higher than the minimum level required, which creates new weaknesses or amplifies the consequences of other weaknesses.\" This aligns directly with the vulnerability description. The **installer is running with elevated privileges**, and this allows the launching of Internet Explorer with elevated privileges, leading to a privilege escalation.\n\nCWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) was considered but not selected as the primary CWE. While incorrect permissions could play a role, the description focuses on the unnecessary privileges being used during the installation process, rather than a specific permission issue on a critical resource.\n\nCWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) was also considered, but this is a high-level, discouraged CWE. The root cause is specifically the unnecessary execution with elevated privileges, which is better captured by CWE-250.\n\nThe retriever results and the CWE descriptions support the selection of CWE-250 as the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nDuring installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
