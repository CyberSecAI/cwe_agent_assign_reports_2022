The retriever results and vulnerability descriptions strongly suggest this weakness. CWE-311 has children CWEs of CWE-312 **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** and CWE-319 **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information**. These were considered as secondary issues as the root cause is the **missing encryption**, leading to the possibility of both storage and transmission in cleartext.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe311 primary\n    class cwe312,cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing encryption** (CWE-311), potentially leading to cleartext storage (CWE-312) and/or cleartext transmission (CWE-319) of sensitive information, ultimately resulting in information leakage and disclosure of sensitive data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-311 as the primary candidate due to the explicit mention of **missing encryption** in the vulnerability description and key phrases. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, although pointing to CWE-119 which is incorrect, doesn't negate the **missing encryption** aspect highlighted in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\". Further analysis of CWE-311's relationships revealed that CWE-312 and CWE-319 are potential consequences of the **missing encryption**, thus solidifying the choice of CWE-311 as the primary weakness. The retriever results also list CWE-311 as the top candidate. The final decision is strongly based on the evidence provided, specifically the **rootcause** stated as \"**missing encryption**\". While CWE-312 and CWE-319 are considered as secondary, CWE-311 remains the most accurate representation of the **rootcause** at an appropriate level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
