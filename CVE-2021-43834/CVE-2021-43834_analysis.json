The vulnerability description clearly points to an incorrect implementation of an authentication algorithm (CWE-303), rather than a general weakness in authentication (CWE-1390). Thus, CWE-303 is preferred due to its higher specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe303[\"CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe303 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe303 primary\n    class cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect implementation of the authentication algorithm** (CWE-303) when using SSO. This leads to **improper authentication**, allowing an attacker to **bypass authentication** and gain unauthorized access to an existing user's account.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which the description identifies as an **incorrect implementation of the authentication algorithm** when using SSO.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section explicitly states: \"The vulnerability stems from an **incorrect implementation of the authentication algorithm** within elabftw when using single sign-on (SSO) options like LDAP or SAML.\" This is strong evidence supporting CWE-303.\n\nCWE-1390, \"Weak Authentication,\" was considered but is too general. The vulnerability is not simply that the authentication is weak, but that a specific authentication algorithm is implemented incorrectly. CWE-303 is a child of CWE-1390 and is more specific, therefore more appropriate.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-303 as the top match, with a similarity score of 0.542.\n\nThe decision to map CWE-303 is based on the explicit description of the **incorrect implementation** within the vulnerability details. This aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-303. CWE-303 is the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 4887.74\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate",
