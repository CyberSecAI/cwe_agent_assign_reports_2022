## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **information exposure** and leads to the unauthorized user gaining access to report data. The vulnerability is triggered by the discovery of the URL.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description indicates an **Information Exposure** vulnerability. The description states that an unauthorized user can gain access to report data if the URL used to access the report is discovered.

The primary CWE is CWE-200 **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**. The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Information Exposure** vulnerability...allows unauthorized user to gain access to report data". While CWE-200 is a class-level CWE and discouraged for use, the provided information is insufficient to identify a more specific base or variant CWE. The retriever results contained multiple more specific children of CWE-200, including CWE-213 **Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies** and CWE-209 **Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information**, but there is no evidence in the description to support the selection of any of these more specific CWEs.
