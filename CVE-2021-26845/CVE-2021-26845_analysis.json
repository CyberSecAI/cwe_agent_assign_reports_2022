The retriever results also listed several children of CWE-200.

The vulnerability is triggered by the discovery of the URL.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates an **Information Exposure** vulnerability. The description states that an unauthorized user can gain access to report data if the URL used to access the report is discovered.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-200 **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Information Exposure** vulnerability...allows unauthorized user to gain access to report data\". While CWE-200 is a class-level CWE and discouraged for use, the provided information is insufficient to identify a more specific base or variant CWE. The retriever results contained multiple more specific children of CWE-200, including CWE-213 **Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies** and CWE-209 **Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information**, but there is no evidence in the description to support the selection of any of these more specific CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:",
