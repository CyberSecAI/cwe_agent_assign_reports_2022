The decision to classify as CWE-287 was influenced by the lack of specific details in the vulnerability description, making it difficult to pinpoint a more precise weakness. The class-level abstraction was chosen to represent the general nature of the authentication bypass.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe1390,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper validation of authentication cookies**, leading to the **impact** of bypassing security restrictions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **improper validation of authentication cookies** as the root cause, as stated in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\". The analysis then considered the Retriever Results, which suggested CWE-614, CWE-327, CWE-287, CWE-522, and CWE-319. The final decision was to select CWE-287: Improper Authentication.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision comes directly from the \"Vulnerability Description,\" which mentions \"**improper validation of authentication cookies**\" leading to a bypass of security restrictions. This aligns with CWE-287's description: \"When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\"\n\nCWE-287 is at the Class level of abstraction. More specific CWEs (children) could potentially be more appropriate, but the current description lacks the details needed to choose a more specific CWE with confidence.\nThe decision to use the class level CWE-287 is inline with the MITRE guidance \"Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1236: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by a spreadsheet product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 7297.78\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base",
