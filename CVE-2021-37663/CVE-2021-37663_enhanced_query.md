# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-37663

## Vulnerability Description
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to **incomplete validation** in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2`, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https//github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_op.cc#L59) has some validation but does not check that `min_range` and `max_range` both have the same non-zero number of elements. If `axis` is provided (i.e., not `-1`), then validation should check that it is a value in range for the rank of `input` tensor and then the lengths of `min_range` and `max_range` inputs match the `axis` dimension of the `input` tensor. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 6da6620efad397c85493b8f8667b821403516708. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37663:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from incomplete validation within the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2` operation in TensorFlow. Specifically, the code fails to properly check if the `min_range` and `max_range` input tensors have a compatible number of elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `QuantizeV2` operation lacks proper checks to ensure the `min_range` and `max_range` tensors have matching sizes when an `axis` is specified. It should check if the sizes match the dimension of the input tensor along the specified axis.
*   **Potential for Out-of-Bounds Access:** When the sizes of these tensors do not match, particularly when `max_range` is an empty list as demonstrated in the provided code, the implementation can lead to a null pointer dereference or out-of-bounds memory access on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Undefined Behavior:**  Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to undefined behavior, which may include:
    *   **Crashes:** The program could crash due to null pointer dereferences or memory access violations.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In certain circumstances, it might be possible for an attacker to use the out-of-bounds write to achieve arbitrary code execution by corrupting memory.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker may be able to read from memory locations outside of the intended bounds, potentially revealing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** An attacker can craft a TensorFlow model that uses the vulnerable `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2` operation with mismatched `min_range` and `max_range` tensor dimensions. The code example `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2( input=[1,2,3], min_range=[1,2], max_range=[], T=tf.qint32, mode='SCALED', round_mode='HALF_AWAY_FROM_ZERO', narrow_range=False, axis=1, ensure_minimum_range=3)` demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Model Poisoning:** The attacker could embed the malicious model into a pipeline and then deliver it via a trusted source to a user running the vulnerable version of TensorFlow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Model Creation or Modification:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify TensorFlow models.
*   **Execution of the Vulnerable Model:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the crafted model in a vulnerable TensorFlow environment.
*   **No special privileges are required.**

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided commit `6da6620efad397c85493b8f8667b821403516708` addresses this vulnerability by adding validation for the `min_range` and `max_range` tensor dimensions and ensuring that the axis is within the limits of the input tensor.
*   The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions before 2.6.0. Patches were also backported to versions 2.3.4, 2.4.3, and 2.5.1.
*   The vulnerability was reported by the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.

This analysis provides more detail than the original CVE description, explaining not only the vulnerability itself, but also its potential impact, attack vectors, and remediation.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

### Extended Description


If the pointer contains an uninitialized value, then the value might not point to a valid memory location. This could cause the product to read from or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial of service. If the uninitialized pointer is used as a function call, then arbitrary functions could be invoked. If an attacker can influence the portion of uninitialized memory that is contained in the pointer, this weakness could be leveraged to execute code or perform other attacks.


Depending on memory layout, associated memory management behaviors, and product operation, the attacker might be able to influence the contents of the uninitialized pointer, thus gaining more fine-grained control of the memory location to be accessed.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.

**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-32878:** LLM product has a free of an uninitialized pointer
- **CVE-2010-0211:** chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) leads to free of invalid, uninitialized pointer (CWE-824).

## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

## CWE-1287: Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to be of a certain type, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually of the expected type.

### Extended Description


When input does not comply with the expected type, attackers could trigger unexpected errors, cause incorrect actions to take place, or exploit latent vulnerabilities that would not be possible if the input conformed with the expected type.


This weakness can appear in type-unsafe programming languages, or in programming languages that support casting or conversion of an input to another type.
