This is caused by the **Use of Uninitialized Resource (CWE-908)**. CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-908 is a child of CWE-665 (Improper Initialization).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe908[\"CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe665[\"CWE-665: Improper Initialization\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe908 -->|CHILDOF| cwe665\n    cwe908 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe908 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **uninitialized data** (CWE-908), which leads to an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787), and finally results in local escalation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a clear chain of events leading to the vulnerability. The root cause is the **Use of Uninitialized Resource (CWE-908)**, which directly leads to the **Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)**. The primary CWE is CWE-787 because that is the direct weakness.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states: \"In memory management driver, there is a possible **out of bounds write** due to **uninitialized data**.\"\n\nThe graph relationships support this classification, with CWE-908 potentially preceding CWE-787.\n\nBoth CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, providing the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why it was not selected:** This vulnerability is caused by uninitialized data and out-of-bounds write.

It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Why it was not selected:** This is a Class level.
