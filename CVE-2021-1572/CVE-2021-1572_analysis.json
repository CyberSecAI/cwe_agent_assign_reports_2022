The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section explicitly mentions \"**Incorrect Privilege Assignment**\" as a weakness. The vulnerability occurs because the affected software **incorrectly** runs the SFTP user service at the privilege level of the account.\n\nI selected CWE-266 as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **rootcause** of the vulnerability, which is the **incorrect** assignment of privileges to the SFTP user service. This aligns with the CWE's description: \"A product **incorrectly assigns a privilege** to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\"\n\nThe other CWEs considered were not as directly related to the **rootcause**. While some CWEs like CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges) and CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) touch on privilege-related issues, they are either too general or do not precisely capture the nature of the vulnerability. For example, CWE-269 is a Class-level CWE and the mapping guidance discourages using it when more specific CWEs are available. CWE-250 describes a scenario where a process runs with higher than necessary privileges, but the described vulnerability is specifically about an incorrect assignment of privilege level.\n\nThe selection of CWE-266 is at the optimal level of specificity because it is a Base-level CWE that accurately represents the weakness described in the vulnerability. The evidence provided supports this classification, and the relationship analysis with its parent CWE further reinforces the decision.",
