CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is a high-level class which is discouraged. CWE-425 is about missing authorization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    \n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe668 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1336 primary\n    class cwe668,cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the improper handling of input in the FreeMarker template engine (CWE-1336), leading to the ability to read sensitive files. This could be seen as an exposure of resources to the wrong sphere (CWE-668) or a missing authorization check (CWE-425).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified several candidate CWEs, but after a detailed analysis, CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) appears to be the most appropriate primary CWE. This is based on the **root cause** being related to the FreeMarker template engine and the ability of attackers to read textual content by injecting special elements.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"Unauthenticated remote attackers can read textual content via FreeMarker including files /scripts/*, /templates/* and some of the files in /.git/* (non-binary).\" This indicates that the **weakness** lies in how FreeMarker handles input, allowing attackers to read sensitive files.\n\nCWE-1336 specifically addresses the scenario where a template engine **does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax**, which aligns with the vulnerability description. The description of CWE-1336 also mentions FreeMarker as an example of a template engine that can be affected by this type of vulnerability.\n\nThe retriever results show CWE-1336 as a top combined result, further supporting this classification.\n\nCWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) was considered because the vulnerability allows attackers to read files they should not have access to. However, CWE-668 is a high-level class and is often misused when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable, as stated in its mapping guidance. Since CWE-1336 provides a more specific explanation of the **root cause**, it is a better fit.\n\nCWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) was also considered because the vulnerability allows attackers to access files directly without proper authorization. However, the **root cause** is not a lack of authorization checks, but rather the improper handling of input in the template engine.\n\nUltimately, CWE-1336 is the most appropriate CWE because it accurately describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the improper handling of special elements in the FreeMarker template engine, leading to the ability to read sensitive files. This aligns with the vulnerability description and the mapping guidance for CWE-1336.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
