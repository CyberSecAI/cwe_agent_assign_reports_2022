CWE-59 is child of CWE-706 (Use of Multiple Path Names to Identify a Resource). A secondary CWE, CWE-377 (Insecure Temporary File), was also considered as the Zoom client copies `runwithroot` to a user-writable temporary directory. CWE-377 is a Class level of abstraction, and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n    cwe377[\"CWE-377: Insecure Temporary File\"]\n    cwe706[\"CWE-706: Use of Multiple Path Names to Identify a Resource\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe59 -->|CHILDOF| cwe706\n    cwe377 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe59 primary\n    class cwe377 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the Zoom client copying `runwithroot` to a user-writable temporary directory. A local attacker can then replace this file. When the Zoom client attempts to execute `runwithroot`, it executes the attacker's malicious code with root privileges.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-59 as the primary weakness due to the possibility of replacing a file with a link. The secondary weakness, CWE-377, relates to the insecure use of temporary files.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that the Zoom Client for Meetings **copies runwithroot to a user-writable temporary directory** during installation, which allows a local process (with the user's privileges) to obtain root access by replacing `runwithroot`. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states that the **root cause** is that the Zoom installer uses the deprecated `AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges` API to execute a bash script (`runwithroot`) with root privileges. This API **does not validate the executable**, which allows an attacker to replace the script with their own malicious one.\n\nCWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')) is suitable because the attacker replaces the original `runwithroot` file with their own malicious file. When the Zoom client attempts to execute the `runwithroot` script, it executes the attacker's file, achieving privilege escalation to root.\n\nCWE-377 (Insecure Temporary File) is also applicable because the vulnerability involves the insecure creation and use of a temporary file in a user-writable directory.\n\nThe selection of CWE-59 and CWE-377 is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary, focusing on the **root cause** and the specific weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it **does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.**\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
