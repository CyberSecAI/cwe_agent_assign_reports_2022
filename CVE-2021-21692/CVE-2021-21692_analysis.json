It is related to CWE-285 [Improper Authorization] through a ChildOf relationship. CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization] is also a child of CWE-285. Given the vulnerability description states the product does not check for delete permission but only read permission, CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] is the better fit because the **root cause** is the complete absence of the correct permission check.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe280[\"CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe280 -->|PEEROF| cwe862\n    cwe280 -->|PEEROF| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe280 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness**: a **missing authorization** check for delete permissions on the source path during file rename or move operations. This leads to a privilege escalation where an attacker controlling an agent process can potentially move or rename files on the Jenkins controller.\n  - The root cause is the **missing authorization** check.\n  - The impact is potential file system manipulation on the controller.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the vulnerability as a **missing authorization** check, specifically **checking read permission instead of delete**. The retriever results suggested CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] and CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization], among others.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states that the **FilePath#renameTo and FilePath#moveAllChildrenTo in Jenkins only check read agent-to-controller access permission on the source path, instead of delete.** This clearly indicates a **missing** authorization check (CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]) for the \"delete\" action, rather than an incorrect one (CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization]).\n\nThe CWE specifications and relationships further support this decision. CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] is a child of CWE-285 [Improper Authorization], which is a more general class. Since the evidence clearly points to a missing check, CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] is more specific and appropriate.\n\nThe evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the **root cause of vulnerability** is the Jenkins only check read permissions on the source path, which is insufficient for these operations.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] is based on the direct evidence of a **missing authorization** check, the supporting CWE relationships, and the mapping guidance that suggests choosing the most specific CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
