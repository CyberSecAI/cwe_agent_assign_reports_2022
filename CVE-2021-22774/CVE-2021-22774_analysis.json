This parent-child relationship indicates that CWE-759 is a more specific case of the general weakness described by CWE-916. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the system uses a one-way hash without a salt, which directly aligns with CWE-759. While CWE-916 is also relevant, CWE-759 provides a more precise characterization of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe759[\"CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n\n    cwe759 -->|CHILDOF| cwe916\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe759 primary\n    class cwe916 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **ROOTCAUSE** of using a one-way hash without a salt (CWE-759). This weakness allows attackers to potentially gain knowledge of user account credentials, which is the **IMPACT**. The attack vector is dictionary attacks techniques.\n\nCWE-759 (Root Cause) -> Impact: Exposure of user credentials\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-759 as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description clearly states the **ROOTCAUSE** is \"**CWE-759 Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt**\", and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this: \"**CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt:** This is the core weakness. Hashing passwords without a salt makes them susceptible to dictionary attacks and rainbow table lookups.\"\n\nThe retriever results also show CWE-759 as the top match.\n\nCWE-916 was considered as a parent weakness since CWE-759 is a child of CWE-916. While the system effectively uses a password hash with insufficient computational effort, the more specific weakness is the absence of a salt.\n\nThe decision to prioritize CWE-759 is based on the explicit mention of \"**Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt**\" in the vulnerability description and its alignment with the detailed CWE specifications. This level of specificity makes CWE-759 the most appropriate choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
