## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **insertion of JWT authentication tokens** into the virtual cluster server logs and ends with the exposure of these tokens to administrators.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which states that "JWT authentication tokens are exposed to administrators in virtual cluster server logs." The **weakness** is the **JWT authentication tokens being exposed**.

The primary CWE identified is CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File). This CWE accurately reflects the vulnerability because the JWT tokens (sensitive information) are being written to the log files, where they should not be. The evidence is the vulnerability description that explicitly mentions the exposure of JWT tokens in the logs.

The retriever results also support this finding, listing CWE-532 as the top combined result.

The selection of CWE-532 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the **insertion of sensitive information into the log file**.
