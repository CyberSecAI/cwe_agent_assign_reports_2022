It's related to CWE-200, which is the broader category of information exposure. There are no child CWEs for CWE-532 that would provide a more specific classification. The graph focuses on direct parent-child relationships, emphasizing the hierarchical structure and abstraction levels involved in the CWE selection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    \n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insertion of JWT authentication tokens** into the virtual cluster server logs and ends with the exposure of these tokens to administrators.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which states that \"JWT authentication tokens are exposed to administrators in virtual cluster server logs.\" The **weakness** is the **JWT authentication tokens being exposed**.\n\nThe primary CWE identified is CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File). This CWE accurately reflects the vulnerability because the JWT tokens (sensitive information) are being written to the log files, where they should not be. The evidence is the vulnerability description that explicitly mentions the exposure of JWT tokens in the logs.\n\nThe retriever results also support this finding, listing CWE-532 as the top combined result.\n\nThe selection of CWE-532 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the **insertion of sensitive information into the log file**.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product writes sensitive information to a log file.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-538\nChildOf -> CWE-200\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
