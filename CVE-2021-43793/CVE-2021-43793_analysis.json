The product allows a user to perform an action (voting) more than once when it should be restricted to a single instance. |\n| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE. The authorization check to limit voting to once per user is not correctly implemented. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-837, which is a Base level CWE. CWE-837 is related to CWE-799 (Improper Control of Interaction Frequency) via a ChildOf relationship. CWE-863 is a Class level CWE, and it has child CWEs, which may be a better fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe837[\"CWE-837: Improper Enforcement of a Single, Unique Action\"]\n    cwe799[\"CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe837 -->|CHILDOF| cwe799\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe837 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Enforcement of a Single, Unique Action** (CWE-837) due to a flaw in the poll feature's handling of voting limits.\n2.  **Weakness:** **Insufficient input validation** allows users to bypass the intended one-vote-per-user restriction.\n3.  **Impact:** Users are able to **vote multiple times**, leading to **manipulation of poll results**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-837 as the primary weakness, which aligns with the description of the vulnerability that allows users to vote multiple times in a single-option poll. The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" supports this, stating that the system \"failed to properly enforce the restriction that a user could only cast one vote on such polls.\"\n\nThe retriever results also highlighted CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, as a relevant CWE. The authorization mechanism intended to prevent multiple votes was **incorrectly implemented**, which aligns with the description of CWE-863.\n\nI am confident in this assessment because the vulnerability description and CVE details directly support the selected CWEs. CWE-837 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it clearly describes the core issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of
