# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-27215

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in genua genugate before 9.0 Z p19, 9.1.x through 9.6.x before 9.6 p7, and 10.x before 10.1 p4. The Web Interfaces (Admin, Userweb, Sidechannel) can use different methods to perform the authentication of a user. A **specific authentication method during login does not check the provided data** (when a certain manipulation occurs) and returns OK for any authentication request. This allows an attacker to login to the admin panel as a user of his choice, e.g., the root user (with highest privileges) or even a non-existing user.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27215:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a flaw in the authentication logic of the Genua GenuGate High Resistance Firewall's web interfaces (Admin, Sidechannel, and User). A specific authentication method within these interfaces fails to properly validate provided login data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is an authentication bypass. By manipulating a specific HTTP POST parameter during login, an attacker can bypass the authentication process and gain unauthorized access.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerable authentication method does not check or validate the provided data, leading to the bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An unauthenticated attacker can gain access to the web interfaces as any user, including the root user with the highest privileges.
- **Complete System Compromise:** With root access, an attacker can take full control of the firewall, potentially compromising the entire network it protects.
- **Data Breach/Manipulation:** Once inside, an attacker can potentially access, modify, or exfiltrate sensitive data.
- **Service Disruption:** An attacker could also disrupt the firewall's services, impacting network connectivity.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-672
ChildOf -> CWE-672
CanPrecede -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.






## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

### Extended Description


If a web product does not properly protect assumed-immutable values from modification in hidden form fields, parameters, cookies, or URLs, this can lead to modification of critical data. Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.


For example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.


### Alternative Terms
Assumed-Immutable Parameter Tampering

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-642
ChildOf -> CWE-471

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is a primary weakness for many other weaknesses and functional consequences, including XSS, SQL injection, path disclosure, and file inclusion.

**[Theoretical]** This is a technology-specific MAID problem.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-0108:** Forum product allows spoofed messages of other users via hidden form fields for name and e-mail address.
- **CVE-2000-0253:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.
- **CVE-2000-0254:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.




## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.
