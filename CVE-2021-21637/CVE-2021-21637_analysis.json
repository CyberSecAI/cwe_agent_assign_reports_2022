It has child relationships to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). The vulnerability involves a **missing permission check**, directly aligning with the description of CWE-862. A secondary candidate is CWE-522, Insufficiently Protected Credentials, which is also a Class-level CWE and a child of CWE-1390 and CWE-287.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weaknesses in Authentication or Authorization Protocols\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe1390,cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which allows an attacker to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs, ultimately leading to the capture of credentials stored in Jenkins. The chain highlights a direct impact on credential security due to the authorization failure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, supported by the provided evidence and Retriever results, points to CWE-862 as the primary weakness. The \"**missing permission check**\" aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-862. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions this missing check as the root cause. While other CWEs like CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) were considered, they represent a secondary consequence rather than the direct root cause. The decision is based on the evidence and the desire to select the most specific and accurate CWE at the Class level as suggested by the mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
