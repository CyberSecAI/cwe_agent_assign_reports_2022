## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-321 | Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key | 1 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-798 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-321, which is a variant of CWE-798. CWE-798 is a base CWE and a parent of CWE-321. This means that CWE-321 is a more specific type of CWE-798. The vulnerability description specifically mentions a **hard-coded cryptographic key**, making CWE-321 the more appropriate choice.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is straightforward:
1.  **Root Cause:** The application uses a **hard-coded cryptographic key** (CWE-321).
2.  **Impact:** Attackers can intercept and decrypt encrypted traffic.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis correctly identified CWE-321 as a strong candidate due to the presence of a **hard-coded cryptographic key**. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-321 is a more specific variant of CWE-798, which deals with hard-coded credentials in general. Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a cryptographic key, CWE-321 is the most appropriate choice.

The selection of CWE-321 is based on the following evidence from the vulnerability description:

*   "By having access to the **hard-coded cryptographic key** for GE Reason RT430, RT431 & RT434 GNSS clocks in firmware versions prior to version 08A06, attackers would be able to intercept and decrypt encrypted traffic through an HTTPS connection."

This statement clearly indicates the presence of a **hard-coded cryptographic key**, which directly aligns with the description of CWE-321.

The analysis also considered CWE-798, but since CWE-321 is a more specific variant, it was chosen as the primary CWE.

The final selection of CWE-321 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the use of a **hard-coded cryptographic key**.
