CWE-1333 is more specific to the use of regular expressions.\n*   CWE-185 (Incorrect Regular Expression): This CWE is about the regular expression not functioning as intended by the developer, whereas CWE-1333 is about the regular expression being inefficient. The key is the resource consumption in the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value): This vulnerability is about memory allocation and the current vulnerability is about CPU Consumption.\n*   CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity): CWE-1333 is a child (more specific) of CWE-407, but given the focus on regular expression, CWE-1333 is a better fit.",
