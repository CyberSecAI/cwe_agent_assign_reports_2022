CWE-122 is a variant specifying that the out-of-bounds write occurs on the heap. CWE-119 is a more general class describing improper restrictions of operations within memory buffer bounds and is a parent of both CWE-787 and CWE-122. The relationship shows a hierarchical path from general to specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a **heap buffer overflow** due to an out-of-bounds write in the `put_qpel_0_0_fallback_16` function. This is triggered by a crafted file, leading to a denial of service or potential arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the provided evidence, indicates a clear **heap buffer overflow** vulnerability in libde265. The **Vulnerability Description** explicitly mentions a \"**heap buffer overflow**\". The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms the root cause as a \"**Heap-buffer-overflow**\" in the `put_qpel_0_0_fallback_16` function, leading to a memory write operation beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.\n\nThe relationship analysis shows that CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is the most appropriate base CWE, with CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) as a more specific variant. While CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a parent class, it is too general for this specific vulnerability, as indicated by its \"Discouraged\" usage in the mapping guidance.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 is based on the clear evidence of an out-of-bounds write, while CWE-122 is selected as the memory corruption occurs on the heap. These CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a detailed and accurate representation of the vulnerability based on the available information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n*This CWE was considered but not selected because the description does not mention an incorrect calculation of a buffer size. The root cause appears to be a failure to validate buffer boundaries during the write operation.*\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n*This CWE was considered but not selected because it doesn't seem to be triggered by an integer underflow condition.*\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n*This CWE was considered but not selected because there is no evidence that a numeric truncation error is related to the root cause of the buffer overflow.*\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n*This CWE was considered but not selected because the vulnerability description states that a heap buffer overflow occurs. A buffer underwrite would be writing before the buffer.*\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n*This CWE was considered but not selected because while an incorrect length value could contribute to the overflow, the description primarily focuses on the out-of-bounds write itself.*\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n*This CWE was considered but not selected because the vulnerability description indicates a heap buffer overflow which is a write operation. This is a read operation.*\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n*This CWE was considered but not selected because the vulnerability description indicates a heap buffer overflow which is a write operation. This is a read operation.*\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.\n\n*This CWE was considered but not selected because it doesn't seem to be triggered by an incorrect conversion between numeric types.*\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n*This CWE was considered but not selected because there's no specific mention or indication of an off-by-one error being the root cause. The primary issue is the **heap buffer overflow** due to an out-of-bounds write.*\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value.\n\n*This CWE was considered but not selected because the description does not indicate that the root cause is an integer overflow. The primary issue is the **heap buffer overflow** due to an out-of-bounds write.*\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6667.14\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\n\n*This CWE was considered but not selected because while a lack of validation could contribute to the overflow, the description primarily focuses on the out-of-bounds write itself.*\n\n## CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\n\n*This CWE was considered but not selected because the description doesn't mention a buffer copy without checking the size of the input. The core issue is the **heap buffer overflow** in the specified function, suggesting the potential for out-of-bounds writes during its operation, not necessarily a",
