CWE-22 is related as a potential impact, representing the file access that results from the double decoding. CWE-174 is chosen because it directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the double decoding of the path.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe174[\"CWE-174: Double Decoding of the Same Data\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe172[\"CWE-172: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Data\"]\n\n    cwe174 -->|CHILDOF| cwe172\n    cwe22 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe174\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe174 primary\n    class cwe22 secondary\n    class cwe172 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **double decoding** (**CWE-174**) of the URL path. This allows an attacker to bypass security checks that are intended to prevent access to protected resources. The impact is **access to files outside the intended directory**, specifically within the WEB-INF directory (**CWE-22**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-174, Double Decoding of the Same Data. This is based on the CVE description stating that \"This double decoding allows paths with a doubly encoded WEB-INF to bypass this security check.\" The vulnerability description itself mentions \"doubly encoded path\". This directly aligns with the description of CWE-174.\n\nCWE-22 is a secondary consideration because the ultimate impact is a form of path traversal, specifically accessing files in WEB-INF. However, the root cause is the double decoding, making CWE-174 the more accurate primary classification.\n\nI considered CWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal), CWE-41 (Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence), and CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path). However, these CWEs do not directly address the double decoding aspect of the vulnerability. While path traversal is the end result, the **root cause** is the **double decoding**. Therefore, CWE-174 is the best fit.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
