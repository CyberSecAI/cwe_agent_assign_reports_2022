It is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The relationship shows that the vulnerability is a specific type of memory corruption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a specially crafted file leading to **memory corruption** due to an Out-of-bounds Write, resulting in arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the Adobe After Effects software is affected by a **memory corruption** vulnerability due to parsing a specially crafted file. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the root cause is an \"Out-of-bounds Write\". The primary CWE identified for similar CVE descriptions is CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). The retriever results also list CWE-787 as the top candidate with a score of 1.0.\n\nThe CWE-787 description matches the vulnerability: \"The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\" This **weakness** leads to the impact of arbitrary code execution.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but deemed less appropriate. For example, CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) was considered since read and write errors can be similar. However, the reference link summary specifies an out-of-bounds write. CWE-665 (Improper Initialization) and CWE-457 (Use of Uninitialized Variable) were also considered but the evidence points more strongly to a write outside of allowed memory bounds rather than a failure to initialize properly.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-787 is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and supporting information. It is at the optimal level of specificity (Base).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
