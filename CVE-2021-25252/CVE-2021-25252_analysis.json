CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) and CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) are more specific weaknesses that can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption. CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400. CWE-789 is a variant of CWE-770, making it more specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n    class cwe789 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a specially crafted file provided by an attacker, leading to **memory exhaustion** in the Trend Micro products. This results in denial-of-service or system freeze.\n\n*   Root Cause: **Memory exhaustion** due to processing a specially crafted file.\n*   Weakness: Uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400), specifically memory.\n*   Impact: Denial-of-service or system freeze.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **memory exhaustion** as the root cause, leading to a denial-of-service. The Retriever Results suggested CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), CWE-772 (Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime), CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), and CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) as potential mappings.\n\nCWE-400 is a class-level CWE and is generally discouraged unless more specific mappings are unavailable. Given the nature of the vulnerability, where an attacker can cause **memory exhaustion** by providing a specially crafted file, CWE-770 and CWE-789 are more appropriate. CWE-770 describes allocation of resources without limits, while CWE-789 describes memory allocation with an excessive size value. Since the vulnerability involves a crafted file that likely triggers excessive memory allocation, both CWE-770 and CWE-789 are relevant.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions **memory exhaustion**, which is a form of uncontrolled resource consumption. The evidence supports mapping to CWE-400 as a general classification, but CWE-770 and CWE-789 provide more specific details about the nature of the weakness.\n\nThe final decision is to map the vulnerability primarily to CWE-400, as the description clearly states **memory exhaustion**. Additionally, map to CWE-770 and CWE-789 as secondary CWEs to provide more context about the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were

Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer,

behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer
