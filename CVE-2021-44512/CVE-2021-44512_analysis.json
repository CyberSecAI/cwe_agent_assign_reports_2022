A more specific Base CWE, CWE-379 (Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions) which is a child of CWE-377, was also considered due to the vulnerability occurring in the context of temporary file creation within a directory with insecure permissions. CWE-379 is a child of CWE-377 (Insecure Temporary File), which is a child of CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere). The relationship analysis guided the decision to map to both CWE-732 and CWE-379, capturing both the general permission issue and the specific context of temporary files.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe379[\"CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions\"]\n    cwe377[\"CWE-377: Insecure Temporary File\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe379 -->|CHILDOF| cwe377\n    cwe377 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe379 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **world-writable permissions** on the `/tmp/tmate/sessions` directory, which allows a local attacker to compromise session handling and obtain read-write session IDs.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource.\n  - **Weakness:** CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions (in the /tmp directory).\n  - **Impact:** Compromise of session handling and potential privilege escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the provided description and CVE reference. The key phrase \"**world-writable permissions**\" immediately pointed to a permission-related issue. The CVE reference content summary confirmed that the `/tmp/tmate/sessions` directory had insecure permissions, allowing local attackers to manipulate files and potentially hijack sessions.\n\nThe Retriever results highlighted several relevant CWEs, including CWE-732, CWE-59, CWE-276, CWE-377, CWE-427 and CWE-379. Among these, CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) stood out as the primary candidate due to its direct relevance to the identified root cause. Additionally, CWE-379 (Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions) was considered as a more specific weakness related to the creation of temporary files with insecure permissions.\n\nThe relationship analysis revealed that CWE-379 is a child of CWE-377 (Insecure Temporary File), which in turn is a child of CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere). While CWE-379 is more specific, CWE-732 directly addresses the **incorrect permission assignment**, making it the primary CWE.\n\nThe final decision was to map the vulnerability to CWE-732 as the primary CWE, reflecting the root cause of the insecure permissions, and CWE-379 as a secondary CWE, providing more specific context related to temporary files. This combination provides a comprehensive representation of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-732 as the primary CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly represents the root cause identified in the vulnerability description and CVE reference. The addition of CWE-379 provides further context without overgeneralizing the classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
