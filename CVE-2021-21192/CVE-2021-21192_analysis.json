CWE-787 is related to CWE-119 (**Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**) as a child. CWE-122 (**Heap-based Buffer Overflow**) is a more specific variant of CWE-787. The decision to select CWE-787 as primary and CWE-122 as secondary is based on the provided information, which explicitly mentions \"heap buffer overflow\".\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **heap buffer overflow**. The **heap buffer overflow** leads to potential heap corruption, which can further lead to arbitrary code execution.\n- The root cause is **Heap buffer overflow** (CWE-787)\n- The impact is potential heap corruption and arbitrary code execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the provided information, which clearly states a \"**Heap buffer overflow**\" vulnerability. The selection of CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**) as the primary CWE is directly supported by this evidence. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-122 (**Heap-based Buffer Overflow**) is a more specific variant of CWE-787. However, due to the broader implications of out-of-bounds writes, and given that the vulnerability could potentially lead to more than just a typical heap overflow scenario, CWE-787 is considered a better primary fit. The retriever results also support this, with CWE-119 (**Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**) being a high-scoring candidate, which is a parent of CWE-787. However, CWE-119 is discouraged.\n\nThe evidence supporting the primary CWE is from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section:\n- **weakness:** **Heap buffer overflow**\n\nThe final decision is based on mapping the root cause, **Heap buffer overflow**, to CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**), which allows a more generalized and accurate classification of the vulnerability and CWE-122 (**Heap-based Buffer Overflow**) as a secondary candidate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not selected because the vulnerability description does not indicate a double free condition.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not selected because the vulnerability description does not indicate sensitive information being exposed during resource reuse.\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not selected because the vulnerability description does not indicate a race condition within a thread.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not selected because the vulnerability description does not indicate improper resource shutdown or release.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not selected because the vulnerability description only mentions **heap buffer overflow**, but not how the buffer size was incorrectly calculated.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not selected because the vulnerability description does not indicate improper locking.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not selected because the vulnerability description does not indicate integer underflow.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not selected because the vulnerability description does not indicate an off-by-one error.\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not selected because the vulnerability description indicates a buffer overflow, not a buffer underflow.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended
