This leads to the **IMPACT** of information disclosure and denial of service.\n  - Insecure Inherited Permissions (CWE-277) -> Information Disclosure & DoS\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **CWE-277 (Insecure Inherited Permissions)** as the primary candidate due to the **ROOT CAUSE** explicitly mentioning \"Insecure inherited permissions\". The retriever results also listed **CWE-277** as the top candidate.\n\nThe decision to select **CWE-277** was heavily based on the vulnerability description, which directly states \"**Insecure inherited permissions** in some Intel(R) ProSet/Wireless WiFi drivers may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure and denial of service via adjacent access.\" The phrase \"**Insecure inherited permissions**\" directly aligns with the name and description of **CWE-277**.\n\n**CWE-277** is a Variant-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)** was considered but rejected because it is a high-level Pillar CWE and less specific than **CWE-277**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.
