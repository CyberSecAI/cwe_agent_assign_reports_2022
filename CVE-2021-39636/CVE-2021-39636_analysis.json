It has hierarchical relationships with CWE-665 [Improper Initialization] (parent) and CWE-909 [Missing Initialization of Resource] (child of CWE-665), this means these classes can be a more general form of the weakness. Also, CWE-909 can precede CWE-908. The abstraction levels influenced the selection, favoring the most specific Base level CWE where the evidence supports it.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe908[\"CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\"]\n    cwe909[\"CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\"]\n    cwe665[\"CWE-665: Improper Initialization\"]\n    \n    cwe908 -->|CHILDOF| cwe665\n    cwe909 -->|CHILDOF| cwe665\n    cwe909 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe908\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe908 primary\n    class cwe909,cwe665 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **uninitialized data**, leading to a kernel information leak and ultimately to local information disclosure. This can be viewed as:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Uninitialized data**\n2.  **Weakness:** Use of uninitialized resource\n3.  **Impact:** Kernel information leak, local information disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **uninitialized data** as the root cause. The Retriever Results suggested CWE-665 [Improper Initialization], CWE-909 [Missing Initialization of Resource], and CWE-908 [Use of Uninitialized Resource] as potential candidates. After reviewing the CWE specifications, CWE-908 [Use of Uninitialized Resource] was selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description states \"there is a possible way to leak kernel information due to **uninitialized data**\" which aligns precisely with the description of CWE-908: \"The product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.\"\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms the root cause: \"Several netfilter matches and targets put kernel pointers into info objects but do not set usersize in descriptors. This results in kernel pointer leaks if a match/target is set and read back to userspace.\" The fix involves properly setting the `usersize` for matches/targets, further reinforcing the **missing initialization** aspect.\n\nCWE-908 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base). While CWE-909 [Missing Initialization of Resource] and CWE-665 [Improper Initialization] are related, they are less specific. The evidence clearly indicates that the **uninitialized data** is being *used*, making CWE-908 the most accurate classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
