The 'Eval Injection' is a variant that occurs when dynamically evaluated code is used.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe95[\"CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe95 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe95 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input sanitization**, leading to code injection via the `eval` function, and finally resulting in arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The vulnerability involves the use of the `eval` function on user-supplied strings, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code. This directly matches the description of CWE-95, \"Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\".\n\nThe evidence from the provided text is:\n- Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: **weakness: improper input sanitization**\n- CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The `saved_model_cli` tool in TensorFlow used the `eval` function to evaluate user-supplied strings passed via the `--input_exprs` argument.\"\n- CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"Using `eval` on user-provided input allowed arbitrary Python code execution.\"\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-95 as the top match with a high score of 0.983.\n\nThe CWE-95 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the use of `eval` for code injection. Other CWEs like CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) are too generic and don't capture the specific nature of the vulnerability.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.
