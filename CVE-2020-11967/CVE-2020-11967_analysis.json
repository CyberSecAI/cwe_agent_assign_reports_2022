CWE-863 is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). The vulnerability description indicates an **incorrect access control** issue, making CWE-863 a relevant candidate. The secondary CWE is CWE-306, which is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). If there is **missing authentication** on a critical function, then an attacker may perform actions that they are not authorized to do.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect access control**, which leads to the ability for remote attackers to control the device.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **Incorrect Access Control** as the root cause of the vulnerability, which allows remote attackers to control the device. The retriever results and complete CWE specifications were then analyzed to find the most appropriate CWE(s).\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), as it directly relates to the **incorrect access control** issue described in the vulnerability. The secondary CWE is CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), because there is no authentication required on the critical functions, enabling the incorrect authorization.\n\nThe selection is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary, which specifically mentions the lack of proper access control.\n\nThe CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-863 being a Class-level CWE and CWE-306 being a Base-level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
