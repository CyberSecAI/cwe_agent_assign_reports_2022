The application constructs an SQL command using externally-influenced input without proper neutralization of special elements, allowing modification of the intended SQL command. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-89, which is a base-level CWE.
