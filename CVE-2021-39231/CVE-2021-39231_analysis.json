The secondary CWE is CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), which is a Class level CWE and a parent of more specific Base level CWEs.\nCWE-306 and CWE-862 are related via the hierarchy: CWE-306 is a ChildOf CWE-287 and CWE-862 is a ChildOf CWE-285 and CWE-284.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of authentication** for internal server-to-server RPC endpoints (CWE-306), leading to **missing authorization** (CWE-862). This allows an attacker to download raw data and modify configurations, impacting data confidentiality and system integrity.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to CWE-306 (**Missing Authentication for Critical Function**) as the primary weakness. This is because the vulnerability description and CVE summary explicitly mention the **lack of authentication** on internal RPC endpoints. The retriever results also list CWE-306 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-862 (**Missing Authorization**) is considered a secondary weakness because the **missing authentication** directly leads to an authorization bypass. Without proper authentication, authorization checks cannot be reliably performed.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-306 is a Base-level CWE, which is preferred, and accurately describes the root cause. While CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, it is included to represent the consequence of the **missing authentication**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization\n\t\t\tVector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are\n\t\t\tsufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected\n\t\t\tcryptographic requirements for that primitive.\n\t\t\t\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
