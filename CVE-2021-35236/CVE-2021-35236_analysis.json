This hierarchical relationship indicates that the specific issue (missing Secure attribute) leads to the more general issue (cleartext transmission). Selecting the Variant CWE-614 provides a more precise classification of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe614 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **lack of the Secure flag in the SSL cookie**, which results in the cookie being transmitted in cleartext if the application is accessed over HTTP. This cleartext transmission can lead to an attacker intercepting the cookie and potentially impersonating the user.\n\nRoot Cause: **Lack of Secure flag** (CWE-614) -> Impact: Cleartext Transmission (CWE-319) -> Potential Impact: User Impersonation\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **lack of the Secure flag in the SSL cookie** as the **root cause**. The retriever results strongly suggest CWE-614 (Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute) as the primary candidate. The vulnerability description clearly states that the **absence of the Secure flag** allows the cookie to be sent over unencrypted HTTP requests, which aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-614. The CWE specifications and mapping guidance for CWE-614 confirm that it is the most appropriate fit. Specifically, the mapping guidance explicitly allows for the use of this CWE and notes that it is at a preferred Variant level of abstraction.\n\nThe relationship analysis further supports this decision, as CWE-614 is a child of CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information). While CWE-319 is a broader category, CWE-614 provides a more specific classification.\n\nThe vulnerability description provides explicit evidence for the classification: \"The Secure flag is not set in the SSL Cookie... This will help protect the cookie from being passed over unencrypted requests. If the application can be accessed over both HTTP, there is a potential for the cookie can be sent in clear text.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, CWE-614 is the optimal choice because it directly addresses the **root cause of the missing Secure flag** and is at the most specific level of abstraction possible.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
