CWE-290 is a child of CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), representing a more specific type of authentication failure. CWE-301 (Reflection Attack in an Authentication Protocol) is a peer of CWE-327 and a child of CWE-1390, indicating a related but distinct authentication weakness. CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-290, making it a less specific but related classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe290[\"CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\"]\n    cwe301[\"CWE-301: Reflection Attack in an Authentication Protocol\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Obsolete or Cryptographically Broken Algorithm\"]\n\n    cwe290 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe290 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe301 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe301 -->|PEEROF| cwe327\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe290 primary\n    class cwe301,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper authentication** in the Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning procedure. The **attacker spoofs** a device being provisioned by using crafted responses. This allows the **attacker to bypass authentication** and **acquire a NetKey and AppKey**, enabling them to perform operations permitted to a provisioned node.\nRoot Cause: Improper Authentication\nWeakness: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\nImpact: Unauthorized access to NetKey and AppKey\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing) as the most appropriate CWE due to the attacker's ability to impersonate a device being provisioned using crafted responses. The **root_cause** from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"The Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning procedure could allow an attacker without knowledge of the AuthValue to impersonate a device being provisioned by using crafted responses.\" This aligns directly with the description of CWE-290, which focuses on incorrectly implemented authentication schemes susceptible to spoofing attacks.\n\nThe retriever results also support this selection, with CWE-290 being the top combined result. The evidence clearly points to a **failure in the authentication** process, where an attacker can successfully **bypass authentication** by **spoofing** a legitimate device. This is further supported by the listed **weaknesses**: \"Improper authentication\" and \"Insufficient protection of credentials\".\n\nCWE-301 (Reflection Attack in an Authentication Protocol) was considered due to the potential for the attacker to reflect authentication evidence. However, the description of the vulnerability indicates that the **attacker crafts responses**, which is more indicative of spoofing rather than a reflection attack.\n\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication) was also considered, but it is a more general class. CWE-290 provides a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nThe final decision to select CWE-290 is based on the evidence of **spoofing** and the resulting **authentication bypass**. This is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability based on the available information. The chosen CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it describes the exact mechanism used to bypass authentication.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
