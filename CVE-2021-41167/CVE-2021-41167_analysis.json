CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (Class). CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Base) can precede CWE-770. The abstraction levels were considered, and the base level was chosen for both CWEs to provide a specific classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** in the `forEachLimit` and `forEachSeries` functions, where **concurrency is not limited** as intended (CWE-770). This **lack of concurrency control** can lead to excessive resource consumption, potentially overwhelming servers and causing denial of service (DoS). The functions `forEachLimit` or `forEachSeries` are called with an iterable and an async function, with the expectation that the specified concurrency limit will be respected. Any code that calls these functions expecting a certain degree of concurrency control is vulnerable.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **concurrency not limited** as the primary **weakness**. This aligns with CWE-770, Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling, as the functions fail to properly restrict the number of concurrent operations. The vulnerability description and CVE reference confirm this by stating that the functions `forEachLimit` and `forEachSeries` do not correctly limit concurrency, potentially leading to resource exhaustion.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting CWE-770's connection to uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) and the potential for improper input validation (CWE-1284) to precede it.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-770 directly addresses the **allocation of resources without limits**, while CWE-1284 can be considered since a quantity (the limit) is not properly validated.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.
