CWE-367 is a specific type of CWE-362, but the description doesn't specifically mention \"time-of-check time-of-use\". The other main relationship was that CWE-200 is a consequence of CWE-362 and a child of CWE-668, but CWE-200 is listed as Discouraged.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition in a read operation**, leading to the **exposure of sensitive information** to an unauthorized actor.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a **race condition** as the root cause, which leads to sensitive information exposure. The provided evidence, particularly the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section, explicitly mentions \"race condition in read operation\" as the root cause and \"expose sensitive information\" as the impact.\n\nThe Retriever Results listed CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) as the top candidate. While CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) is more specific and also related, the description doesn't clearly indicate a TOCTOU scenario. Therefore, CWE-362 is more appropriate as it directly addresses the **race condition** aspect. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is also listed, but it's a consequence of the **race condition**, not the root cause itself, and is discouraged.\n\nThe decision to choose CWE-362 is based on the evidence of a **race condition**, its high ranking in the Retriever Results, and its direct relevance to the vulnerability description. While CWE-367 is a more specific child, there isn't enough evidence to support it. CWE-200 is a consequence and is discouraged. Therefore, CWE-362 is at the optimal level of specificity, representing the underlying **weakness** that allows the sensitive information exposure.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
