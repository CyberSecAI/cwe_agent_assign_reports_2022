CWE-122 (**Heap-based Buffer Overflow**) is a variant of CWE-787. The relationship indicates a clear path from a general memory safety issue (CWE-119) to a specific type of out-of-bounds write (CWE-787), with further refinement specifying where the overflow occurs (CWE-122).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with a **heap buffer overflow** (**CWE-787** or **CWE-122**), leading to a system crash and remote denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-787, supported by the vulnerability description key phrases and the CVE reference links content summary, both explicitly mentioning a **heap buffer overflow**. The Retriever Results also listed CWE-119, CWE-122, and CWE-787 as potential candidates.\n\nThe final decision favors CWE-787 as the primary weakness because it directly represents the **root cause** (**out-of-bounds write**). CWE-122 is a more specific variant describing where the buffer is allocated, which makes it a suitable secondary candidate, and CWE-119 is too general but provides context.\n\nThe selection is based on the provided evidence, relationship analysis, and adherence to mapping guidance, which collectively support a confident classification. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
