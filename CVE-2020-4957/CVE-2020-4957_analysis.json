Both are related to the broader issue of exposing sensitive data. CWE-319, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, is also relevant as the URL parameters are transmitted without encryption. The relationships helped in determining the specificity of the weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe598[\"CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe598 -->|CHILDOF| cwe201\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe598 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insertion of sensitive information** into the URL parameters. This leads to the **transmission of this sensitive information in cleartext**, which can then be intercepted by an attacker.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-598, Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings, because the **impact** is the disclosure of sensitive information in URL parameters, aligning with the CWE description. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states that the **root cause of the vulnerability** is due to sensitive information being disclosed in URL parameters within the Bulk Data Load module. This is further supported by the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which highlights the **impact** of the vulnerability as the disclosure of sensitive information in URL parameters.\n\nCWE-319 is considered as a secondary candidate because the vulnerability involves transmitting sensitive information without encryption.\nCWE-201 is considered a secondary candidate because it broadly covers the insertion of sensitive information into sent data.\n\nI am confident in my decision because the evidence strongly supports the chosen CWE and its relationships to other relevant CWEs. The selection is based on the vulnerability's root cause and impact as described in the vulnerability description and supporting documentation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
