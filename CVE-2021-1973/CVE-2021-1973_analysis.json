CWE-822 was also considered because the arbitrary write could potentially be achieved by dereferencing an untrusted pointer.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe822[\"CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe822 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe822 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe822 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a FTM Diag command leading to an **arbitrary write** into the modem OS space.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the **arbitrary write**. While the exact mechanism isn't fully detailed, the impact is clearly an out-of-bounds write.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"A FTM Diag command can allow an **arbitrary write** into modem OS space.\"\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is the most direct mapping because the vulnerability results in writing data outside the intended memory boundaries. The evidence is the description states \"arbitrary write into modem OS space\". This write is performed without proper bounds checking, allowing an attacker to overwrite critical system memory.\n\nCWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference) was considered because an attacker might control a pointer, leading to an **arbitrary write** via pointer dereference. However, the description doesn't explicitly mention an untrusted pointer, making CWE-787 a more precise fit.\n\nTherefore, CWE-787 is selected as the primary CWE, representing the **out-of-bounds write** vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect
