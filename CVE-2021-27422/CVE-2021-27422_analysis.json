While CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a related Class-level CWE, it's discouraged as it describes the impact rather than the root cause. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is also related, as the lack of authentication leads to the cleartext transmission.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe319\n    cwe319 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** (CWE-306) for the web server interface. This leads to **sensitive information being transmitted in cleartext** (CWE-319) over HTTP, ultimately resulting in the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200) to unauthorized actors.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards CWE-319 as the primary weakness, given the explicit mention of sensitive information being transmitted over HTTP in cleartext. The root cause is the **lack of authentication** (CWE-306), but the direct consequence is the **cleartext transmission** (CWE-319). CWE-200 is the high-level impact that results from the cleartext transmission.\n\nEvidence:\n- Vulnerability Description: \"...web server interface is supported on UR over HTTP protocol. It allows sensitive information exposure without authentication.\"\n- CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The root cause is the lack of authentication on the web server interface which allows sensitive information exposure over HTTP protocol.\"\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-306 can precede CWE-319, leading to the impact of CWE-200. Selecting CWE-319 as the primary weakness is justified because it directly addresses the technical flaw of transmitting sensitive information in cleartext. It is a base level CWE which is more specific than class level CWE-311.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
