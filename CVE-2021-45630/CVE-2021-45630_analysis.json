The vulnerability involves the construction of commands using external input without proper neutralization. |\n| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. While CWE-77 is broader, if the commands are OS commands, CWE-78 is more specific. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-77, which is a Class-level CWE. CWE-78 is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-77. The vulnerability description indicates a **command injection** vulnerability. Since it is not explicitly stated that the command injection is an OS command injection, I have chosen CWE-77 as the primary, but if it were OS commands, then CWE-78 is more specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe77 primary\n    class cwe78 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the lack of proper neutralization of special elements in commands constructed using external input, leading to **command injection**.\n  - Root Cause: **Improper Neutralization**\n  - Weakness: **Command Injection**\n  - Impact: Arbitrary command execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the provided evidence, strongly suggests a **command injection** vulnerability. The key phrase \"command injection\" from the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** and the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** both support this.\n\nThe analysis considered the relationship between CWE-77 and CWE-78, preferring CWE-77 because the description doesn't specify OS commands.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-77 is chosen because it directly addresses the **command injection** vulnerability and is more general. If OS commands are injected, CWE-78 would be more specific.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not selected* - This CWE doesn't fit the vulnerability description, which is focused on **command injection**, not resource management.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected* - This CWE doesn't fit the vulnerability description, which is focused on **command injection**, not resource reuse.\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n*Not selected* - This CWE doesn't fit the vulnerability description, which is focused on **command injection**, not resource management.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
