# Enhanced Query for CVE-2020-0069

# Vulnerability Description

    In the ioctl handlers of the Mediatek Command Queue driver, there is a possible **out of bounds write** due to **insufficient input sanitization** and **missing SELinux restrictions**. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-147882143References: M-ALPS04356754
