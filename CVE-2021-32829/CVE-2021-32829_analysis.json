It's related to CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) as a child, indicating it's a specific type of injection. CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) and CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data) are considered as secondary because the vulnerability involves evaluating a script but is not directly related to a template engine or deserialization process in the traditional sense.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe94 -->|PEEROF| cwe1336\n    cwe94 -->|PEEROF| cwe502\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe1336,cwe502 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the lack of proper input sanitization, leading to the **bypass of the Groovy shell sandbox** due to ineffective restrictions on Java annotations (**meta-programming escapes**), which results in post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, several CWEs were considered based on the descriptions and retriever results, including CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-917 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')). However, the core issue is that the system generates and executes code based on user-supplied input without proper **neutralization** of special elements that could modify the code's behavior. The vulnerability involves a **bypass of the Groovy shell sandbox** due to **meta-programming escapes**. The `script` parameter is evaluated as a Groovy script, but the sandbox is ineffective at controlling code placed in Java annotations. This aligns strongly with CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')).\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description includes:\n- \"Affected versions of ZStack REST API are vulnerable to post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) via **bypass of the Groovy shell sandbox**.\"\n- \"Even though the sandbox heavily restricts the receiver types to a small set of allowed types, the sandbox is non effective at controlling any code placed in Java annotations and therefore vulnerable to **meta-programming escapes**.\"\n- \"The HTTP request parameter script is mapped to the APIBatchQueryMsg.script property and evaluated as a Groovy script in BatchQuery.query\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-94 is based on the fact that the vulnerability involves generating code (Groovy script) from user-controlled input (`script` parameter) and executing it, leading to RCE. While other CWEs like CWE-1336 and CWE-502 were considered, they do not fully capture the essence of the vulnerability, which is the **improper control of code generation**. CWE-94 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the root cause, which is the **improper** handling of user-controlled input during code generation. While there are various types of injections, this one specifically leads to generating code and therefore CWE-94 is the best fit.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
