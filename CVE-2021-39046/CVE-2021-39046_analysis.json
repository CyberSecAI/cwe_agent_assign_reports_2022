CWE-312 is a child of CWE-311 **Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data**. CWE-256 **Plaintext Storage of a Password** is a child of CWE-522 **Insufficiently Protected Credentials**.\nThe relationship analysis shows a hierarchical relationship, where the Class level CWEs (CWE-522, CWE-311) have more specific Base level CWEs (CWE-312, CWE-256) as children.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe256,cwe522,cwe311 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** of **storing user credentials in plain clear text**. The impact of this is that a privileged user can read the credentials, leading to potential unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the IBM products **store user credentials in plain clear text**. The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section also highlights this **weakness**. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms that the root cause is an unspecified flaw leading to information disclosure.\n\nThe Retriever Results list CWE-312 **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** as the top match based on dense retrieval, and #6 overall. The vulnerability description aligns directly with the description of CWE-312, \"The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\" This makes it the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nCWE-256 **Plaintext Storage of a Password** is also a good match, and is a more specific type of CWE-312, but since the vulnerability description refers to user credentials in general and not specifically passwords, CWE-312 is a slightly better fit.\n\nCWE-522 **Insufficiently Protected Credentials** is a Class level CWE that can be considered because it is a parent of CWE-256. However, since the credentials are not just insufficiently protected, but stored in cleartext, a more specific Base level CWE is preferred.\n\nI am overriding the general mapping guidance to prefer CWE-312 over CWE-256, due to the vulnerability description referring to more than just passwords.\nCWE-319 **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information**, CWE-209 **Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information**, CWE-532 **Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File**, CWE-756 **Missing Custom Error Page**, CWE-613 **Insufficient Session Expiration**, CWE-614 **Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute**, and CWE-326 **Inadequate Encryption Strength** do not accurately describe the **weakness** of **storing user credentials in plain clear text**, so they are not considered.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.47\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate",
