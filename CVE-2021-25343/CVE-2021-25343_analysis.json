CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is a related Class level CWE, acting as a parent to more specific authorization flaws.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe941[\"CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe941 -->|PEEROF| cwe285\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe941 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **calling of a non-existent provider**, leading to a situation where the communication channel's destination is incorrectly specified (CWE-941). This, in turn, allows for unauthorized actions, including a denial-of-service attack.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the provided vulnerability description, the **calling of a non-existent provider** in Samsung Members allows for unauthorized actions and a denial-of-service attack. The key phrase \"**calling of non-existent provider**\" points to an issue with how the application handles communication destinations.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-941 (Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel). This is because the vulnerability involves a misconfiguration or error in specifying the correct destination for a communication channel, as evidenced by the \"**calling of non-existent provider**\" **weakness**. The **impact** is unauthorized actions.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was considered but is a less precise fit. While the unauthorized actions stem from this **weakness**, the root cause is more specifically related to the incorrect specification of the communication destination. CWE-285 is a higher-level class, and the evidence supports a more specific base-level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
