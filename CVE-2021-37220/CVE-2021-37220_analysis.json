It has parent CWEs of CWE-119. It is a single CWE without any chain relationships in this case. The other CWEs considered did not fit well because they represented different types of errors (integer overflows, incorrect size calculations).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of root cause and weaknesses that followed for the Vulnerability Description:\n  - **Root Cause:** The cached color converter does not properly consider the maximum key size of a hash table\n  - **Weakness:** **Out-of-bounds write** because the cached color converter does not properly consider the maximum key size of a hash table.\n  - **Impact:** Program crash (segmentation fault).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is clearly described as an **out-of-bounds write**. The \"Vulnerability Description\" states: \"MuPDF through 1.18.1 has an **out-of-bounds write** because the cached color converter does not properly consider the maximum key size of a hash table.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" elaborates: \"**Out-of-bounds write**: When a color conversion key exceeds the maximum size allowed by the hash table, it results in an out-of-bounds write.\" This strong evidence supports the selection of CWE-787.\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is the best match because it directly describes the vulnerability. The description of CWE-787 states: \"The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\" This perfectly aligns with the vulnerability description. The CWE-787 entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level. The mapping guidance also specifies \"Usage: Allowed\" with the rationale that \"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\"\n\nOther CWEs were considered but ultimately rejected:\n\n*   CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size): While a size calculation might be involved, the core issue is writing beyond the buffer, not the calculation itself.\n*   CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound): No integer overflow is mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read): The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds *write*, not a read.\n*   CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input): Could be a contributing factor, but the OOB write is the direct weakness.\n*   CWE-197 (Numeric Truncation Error): There is no mention of truncation errors.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 is at the optimal level of specificity because it is a base-level CWE that accurately represents the root cause.",
