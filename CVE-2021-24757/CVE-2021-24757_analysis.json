CWE-434 [CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type] is a peer of CWE-430 [CWE-430: Deployment of Wrong Handler].

Later, even after unauthenticated access was removed, the action still lacked proper authorization checks, making it exploitable by any authenticated user.\n\nThe primary weakness is CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] because the application **does not perform the necessary authorization checks**. This aligns with the description of CWE-862, where \"the product **does not perform an authorization check** when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\" The vulnerability description key phrases state a **lack of capability checks**, and the CVE reference links confirm that the plugin's AJAX action `spl_upload_ser_img` for uploading images **lacked capability checks**.\n\nThe secondary weakness is CWE-434 [CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type] because the **missing authorization** leads to the **unrestricted upload of files**, which is a dangerous file type. The CVE reference links confirm that the vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary image files.\n\nCWE-285 [CWE-285: Improper Authorization] was considered but not selected because it's a more general case that includes both missing and incorrect authorization, and CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] provides a more precise description of the vulnerability. CWE-863 [CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization] was also considered, but it does not fit because the authorization check is **missing**, not **incorrect**. CWE-425 [CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')] was also considered, but the root cause is not directly related to direct requests but rather to the absence of authorization checks.",
