# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-44655

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-89 and CWE-74, indicating that SQL injection is a specific type of injection. Also, CWE-89 can be primary to authentication errors. Since the **SQL injection vulnerability** leads to authentication bypass, it is a potential relationship. The relationship between CWE-287 and CWE-89 is that **SQL Injection vulnerability** can be resultant from it.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events starts with **unsanitized user input** leading to a **SQL injection vulnerability**, which then allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain administrator access.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-89 as the primary weakness due to the presence of a **SQL injection vulnerability**. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms this by stating that the application is vulnerable to time-based blind SQL injection due to **unsanitized user-supplied input**. This aligns perfectly with CWE-89's description of constructing SQL commands using externally-influenced input without proper neutralization.

The vulnerability description states that the **SQL injection vulnerability** in the login form allows an attacker to bypass authentication.

The selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause, which is the **improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command**.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function


## CWE Relationship Analysis

Current CWEs represent these abstraction levels: .
