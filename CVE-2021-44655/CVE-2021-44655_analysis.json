Also, CWE-89 can be primary to authentication errors. Since the **SQL injection vulnerability** leads to authentication bypass, it is a potential relationship. The relationship between CWE-287 and CWE-89 is that **SQL Injection vulnerability** can be resultant from it.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe89 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with **unsanitized user input** leading to a **SQL injection vulnerability**, which then allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain administrator access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-89 as the primary weakness due to the presence of a **SQL injection vulnerability**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this by stating that the application is vulnerable to time-based blind SQL injection due to **unsanitized user-supplied input**. This aligns perfectly with CWE-89's description of constructing SQL commands using externally-influenced input without proper neutralization.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that the **SQL injection vulnerability** in the login form allows an attacker to bypass authentication.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause, which is the **improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nWhen an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function",
