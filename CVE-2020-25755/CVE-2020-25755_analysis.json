This is a base-level CWE, offering specific details about the vulnerability. CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')) and CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')).\nCWE-259 is a variant that is related to the authentication bypass to get to the command injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe74,cwe259 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **USE** of hardcoded credentials (CWE-259) for authentication bypass. This then allows the attacker to inject OS commands (CWE-78) due to **IMPROPER** neutralization of special elements in the `force` parameter.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-78 as the primary weakness due to the **IMPROPER** neutralization of input leading to command injection. The evidence for this is found in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states, \"The vulnerability stems from a **lack of input sanitization** in the `/installer/upgrade_start` endpoint... Specifically, the `force` query parameter, which is directly controlled by the user, is passed unsanitized to a system command.\" The impact is \"Arbitrary Code Execution.\"\n\nAdditionally, the hardcoded credentials for authentication bypass are also a major factor in this vulnerability. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states that \"the attacker can bypass this using default installer credentials, which are easily obtained via a hardcoded password generation algorithm based on the device's serial number.\" This leads to the inclusion of CWE-259 as a secondary weakness.\n\nThe graph relationships show how CWE-78 is a specific type of command injection, related to more general command injection issues. CWE-259 is included because of the hardcoded credentials.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-78 accurately describes the **IMPROPER** neutralization of OS command special elements, and CWE-259 identifies the use of hardcoded credentials.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
