# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-37003

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.75 | Class | Primary | Discouraged |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.3 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered was the parent-child relationship between CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and its potential children, which are more specific types of input validation issues. The analysis also considered the potential for CWE-20 to precede other vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20), which leads to a kernel crash. While the exact mechanism of the crash isn't specified, it's plausible that the **improper input validation** leads to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) causing the crash.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified **Improper Input Validation** as the primary weakness, based on the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" which identified the **rootcause** as "**Improper Input Validation**". The description states that this leads to a kernel crash.

The retriever results also point to CWE-20 as a top candidate. However, the CWE specifications for CWE-20 discourage its use as it's a high-level Class and is frequently misused. The suggested alternatives are more specific types of input validation issues. However, the provided vulnerability description lacks the details to determine what type of input validation is missing. Therefore, CWE-20 is chosen despite the discouraged usage.

The possibility of an Out-of-Bounds Write (CWE-787) is considered as a potential consequence of the **improper input validation**, ultimately causing a kernel crash. While not explicitly stated, this is a common outcome when input validation is missing and memory corruption occurs.

The assessment is primarily based on the provided evidence. The "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" section is the main source of information, specifically the **rootcause** entry.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product receives input or data, but it does
        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the
        properties that are required to process the data safely and
        correctly.
### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider lower-level children such as Improper Use of Validation Framework (CWE-1173) or improper validation involving specific types or properties of input such as Specified Quantity (CWE-1284); Specified Index, Position, or Offset (CWE-1285); Syntactic Correctness (CWE-1286); Specified Type (CWE-1287); Consistency within Input (CWE-1288); or Unsafe Equivalence (CWE-1289).

## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
**Abstraction:** base
**Similarity Score**: 4.33
**Source**: graph

**Description**:
CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

The selection of CWE-20 is at the Class level due to the lack of specific details about the **improper input validation**. While discouraged, it remains the most appropriate given the available information. Ideally, a more specific CWE would be used if more details were available.
The selection of CWE-787 is speculative because a Kernel crash could have multiple rootcauses.
