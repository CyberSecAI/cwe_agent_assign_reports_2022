CWE-294 is a child of CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). The relationship indicates that the **authentication bypass** is achieved specifically through capture-replay, making CWE-294 more specific and appropriate than its parents.\nCWE-319 is a peer of CWE-294.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe294[\"CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe294 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe294 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe294 primary\n    class cwe1390,cwe287,cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** in authentication, specifically the lack of replay protection. This allows an attacker to capture and replay UDP packets, leading to **authentication bypass** and ultimately, remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **authentication bypass** as the core issue. The detailed analysis of the CVE description and the retriever results strongly support CWE-294 as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly states that \"Authentication Bypass can occur via Packet Replay.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the **root cause** as \"a lack of proper authentication and replay protection.\"\n\nCWE-294 is selected because it accurately reflects the vulnerability's root cause, which is the **authentication bypass** achieved through the replay of captured packets. The evidence clearly supports this classification, and the CWE's description aligns perfectly with the vulnerability's technical details. The selection of CWE-294 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) and is supported by the MITRE mapping guidance.\n\nCWE-319 is considered as a secondary CWE because the application transmits the MD5 hash of the password, which can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
