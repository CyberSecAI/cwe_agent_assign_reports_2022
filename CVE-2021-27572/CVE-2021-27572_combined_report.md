## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** in authentication, specifically the lack of replay protection. This allows an attacker to capture and replay UDP packets, leading to **authentication bypass** and ultimately, remote code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified the **authentication bypass** as the core issue. The detailed analysis of the CVE description and the retriever results strongly support CWE-294 as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly states that "Authentication Bypass can occur via Packet Replay." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the **root cause** as "a lack of proper authentication and replay protection."

CWE-294 is selected because it accurately reflects the vulnerability's root cause, which is the **authentication bypass** achieved through the replay of captured packets. The evidence clearly supports this classification, and the CWE's description aligns perfectly with the vulnerability's technical details. The selection of CWE-294 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) and is supported by the MITRE mapping guidance.

CWE-319 is considered as a secondary CWE because the application transmits the MD5 hash of the password, which can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-27572

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in Emote Remote Mouse through 4.0.0.0. Authentication Bypass can occur via Packet Replay. Remote unauthenticated users can execute arbitrary code via crafted UDP packets even when passwords are set.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **authentication bypass**
- **vector:** crafted UDP packets
- **attacker:** remote unauthenticated users
- **product:** Emote Remote Mouse
- **version:** through 4.0.0.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27572:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a lack of proper authentication and replay protection in the Remote Mouse application. Specifically, the application does not implement cryptographic nonces or other mechanisms to prevent the replay of captured UDP packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication even when a password is set. The application only checks for the password on the initial TCP handshake and not on subsequent UDP packets used for sending commands.
*   **Packet Replay:** The absence of nonces allows attackers to replay captured UDP packets, thereby executing commands on the target machine even if the attacker doesn't know the password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By replaying crafted UDP packets, attackers can inject arbitrary keystrokes, execute commands (including opening a reverse shell), close applications, and more on the target machine.
*   **Complete Control:** Successful exploitation gives the attacker the ability to control the target machine as if they had physical access, including full keyboard and mouse control, as well as the ability to close processes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack is conducted over the network, requiring the attacker to be on the same network as the target machine or able to route packets to the target.
*   **UDP Packets:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted UDP packets to the Remote Mouse server running on the target machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to communicate with the target machine's Remote Mouse server over the network.
*   **Packet Capture (Optional):** While not strictly necessary, capturing legitimate UDP packets can assist an attacker in understanding the application's protocol and crafting the necessary packets for exploitation. The attacker can also craft their own packets from scratch by analyzing the binary.
*   **Basic Understanding of Networking:** The attacker must have a basic understanding of networking concepts (IP addresses, ports, UDP) to craft and send the packets.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content gives an extremely detailed overview of the entire reverse engineering and exploit development process that was used to find these issues, including:
    *   Wireshark captures showing the packets.
    *   Reversing the .NET application to understand the protocol being used.
    *   Python PoC code to demonstrate exploitation.
    *   Explanation of the flawed authentication method, where it MD5's the user's password and sends this "encrypted" payload along with all commands over UDP.
    *   A demonstration of how an attacker could force an update of the application through a MITM attack with a crafted malicious binary due to the application using HTTP rather than HTTPS for the update feature.
    *   Explanation of how the attacker is able to extract all running applications on the system, including their icons.
*   The vulnerability is present in Remote Mouse versions up to 3.015.
*   The vendor released an update (version 4.0.0.0) with new features, but did not patch any of the security vulnerabilities listed in the write-up.
*   The write-up includes a tool (`mousetrap.py`) that can be used to exploit this and other vulnerabilities present in the application.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

### Extended Description
Capture-replay attacks are common and can be difficult to defeat without cryptography. They are a subset of network injection attacks that rely on observing previously-sent valid commands, then changing them slightly if necessary and resending the same commands to the server.

### Alternative Terms

ChildOf -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-3435:** product authentication succeeds if user-provided MD5 hash matches the hash in its database; this can be subjected to replay attacks.
- **CVE-2007-4961:** Chain: cleartext transmission of the MD5 hash of password (CWE-319) enables attacks against a server that is susceptible to replay (CWE-294).




## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.

## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.

### Extended Description


A hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:

```
		Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.
		Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.
```
In the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.

The Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.

**[Maintenance]** This entry could be split into multiple variants: an inbound variant (as seen in the second demonstrative example) and an outbound variant (as seen in the first demonstrative example). These variants are likely to have different consequences, detectability, etc. More importantly, from a vulnerability theory perspective, they could be characterized as different behaviors.



### Observed Examples

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.
