CWE-1333 is also a child of CWE-407 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), which is related to the Denial of Service impact of the vulnerability. I considered CWE-400, which is a broader class encompassing various resource consumption issues leading to DoS, but ultimately chose CWE-1333 because it specifically identifies the **inefficient regular expression** as the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Denial of Service')\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe407 -->|PARENT_OF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe407 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the use of an **inefficient regular expression** (CWE-1333). This leads to excessive CPU consumption when processing specially crafted inputs, ultimately resulting in a denial-of-service condition (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nMy analysis is primarily based on the explicit vulnerability description, which mentions \"**regular expression denial of service**\" as the **weakness**. The description directly aligns with CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity).\n\nThe retriever results also strongly support CWE-1333 as the top candidate, with a score of 1.0 based on alternate terms. While other CWEs like CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) and CWE-1321 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')) were considered, they do not accurately represent the root cause of this specific vulnerability.\n\nCWE-1333 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly identifies the root cause of the denial of service as being due to an **inefficient regular expression**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1.000 (Retriever Results)\n**Source**: alternate_terms (Retriever Results)\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Denial of Service')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n\n**Description**: The software does not properly control the consumption of resources, leading to a denial of service.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: While DoS is the impact, look for the rootcause to see what is causing the DoS.\n\n## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n\n**CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity)**: This CWE is selected as the primary weakness because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**regular expression denial of service**\" and that some languages before 1.24.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The description of CWE-1333 states: \"The product uses a regular expression with an **inefficient**, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\" This aligns perfectly with the vulnerability. The security implication is that an attacker can craft a specific input that causes the regular expression engine to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. It is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. Confidence: 1.0\n\n**CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Denial of Service'))**: This CWE is selected as a secondary weakness because the impact of the inefficient regular expression is a denial of service. While CWE-1333 identifies the root cause, CWE-400 describes the resulting impact.",
