CWE-653 is a Class-level CWE for Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization. CWE-1331 is also a peer of CWE-1189, Improper Isolation of Shared Resources on System-on-a-Chip (SoC). Given the vulnerability description specifically mentions \"network on chip\", CWE-1331 is a more precise mapping than its parent CWE-653 or peer CWE-1189. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is also related as the impact of improper isolation can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1331[\"CWE-1331: Improper Isolation of Shared Resources in Network On Chip (NoC)\"]\n    cwe653[\"CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe1189[\"CWE-1189: Improper Isolation of Shared Resources on System-on-a-Chip (SoC)\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe1331 -->|CHILDOF| cwe653\n    cwe1331 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe1331 --|PEEROF| cwe1189\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1331 primary\n    class cwe653,cwe1189,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper isolation of shared resources** (CWE-1331) in the network on chip. This **weakness** leads to a potential denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **root cause** described in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section: \"**Improper isolation of shared resources**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" reinforces this by stating: \"The **root cause** lies in inadequate isolation of shared resources\".\n\nThe Retriever Results identified CWE-1331 as the top candidate, and its description closely matches the vulnerability: \"The Network On Chip (NoC) does not isolate or incorrectly isolates its on-chip-fabric and internal resources such that they are shared between trusted and untrusted agents, creating timing channels.\" The \"Observed Examples\" section for CWE-1331 in the Complete CWE Specifications even includes CVE-2021-33096, which is the CVE being analyzed.\n\nCWE-653 was considered as a parent, but CWE-1331 is more specific to the Network On Chip. CWE-400 was considered because the impact is a denial of service. However, the root cause is the **improper isolation**, not the resource consumption itself.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence in the vulnerability description and the matching description of CWE-1331, making it the most appropriate and specific CWE for this vulnerability.",
