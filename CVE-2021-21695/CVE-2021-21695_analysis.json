CWE-61 (UNIX Symbolic Link Following) is a Compound CWE that is a child of CWE-59, representing a specific case of link following in UNIX systems. CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory) is related because the symlink following can lead to path traversal outside the intended directory.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n    cwe61[\"CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n\n    cwe61 -->|CHILDOF| cwe59\n    cwe22 -->|CHILDOF| cwe706\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe59 primary\n    class cwe61,cwe22 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of symbolic links** (CWE-59) within the `FilePath#listFiles` method. This leads to the ability to list files outside the intended directories, potentially causing information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **weakness** as the `FilePath#listFiles` method listing files outside allowed directories when following symbolic links. The CVE reference summary confirms this, stating that the method **does not properly check permissions when following symbolic links**, leading to a violation of access control.\n\nThe selection of CWE-59 is based on the clear evidence that the vulnerability involves **improper link resolution before file access**. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"following symbolic links\", which aligns directly with CWE-59. The retriever results also list CWE-59 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-61 was considered because the description mentions symbolic links, and it's a child of CWE-59 and specific to UNIX systems. However, the description doesn't explicitly state that the vulnerability is specific to UNIX, so choosing the more general CWE-59 is more appropriate. CWE-22 was considered because the symlink following could potentially lead to path traversal, but the core issue is with the **improper link resolution**, making CWE-59 the primary weakness.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity. CWE-59 is a Base CWE and accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it **does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.**\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product, when opening a file or directory, **does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere.** This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product **does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.**\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
