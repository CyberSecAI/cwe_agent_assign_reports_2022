CWE-73 (**External Control of File Name or Path**) is a peer that is related to the file operations and user-controlled input, and often occurs in conjunction with directory traversal vulnerabilities. The vulnerability description highlights the **improper neutralization** of path traversal sequences (\"../\") within user-supplied input, fitting the definition of CWE-23.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    \n    cwe23 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe23 --|PEEROF| cwe73\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe23 primary\n    class cwe22,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the attacker controlling the file path via a GET parameter. The application **fails to properly neutralize** the \"..\" sequences, allowing the attacker to access files outside the intended directory. This leads to the impact of reading arbitrary server files.\n\n*   Attacker Controlled Input (GET parameter \"file\")\n*   **Improper Neutralization** (CWE-23)\n*   File Access outside intended directory\n*   Impact: Reading arbitrary server files\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points towards CWE-23 (**Relative Path Traversal**) as the primary weakness, with supporting evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The description explicitly states the attacker can read server files using an \"infected file GET parameter\" and the summary notes the **root cause** is the `view_source.php` file **not properly sanitizing** the `file` parameter, enabling local file inclusion via path traversal.\n\nThe Retriever Results also lists CWE-23 as the top combined result.\n\nCWE-73 (**External Control of File Name or Path**) was also considered, as the vulnerability involves user-controlled input influencing file names or paths. However, the core issue is the **improper neutralization** of path traversal sequences, making CWE-23 a more precise fit.\n\nThe selection of CWE-23 at the Base level is appropriate because it directly represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the **failure to properly neutralize** relative path sequences in user-controlled input. This allows the attacker to read arbitrary files on the server.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
