CWE-522 **Insufficiently Protected Credentials** is a Class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-312. CWE-257 **Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format** is a Base level CWE and a child of CWE-522. CWE-497 **Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere** is a Base level CWE and a child of CWE-200 **Information Exposure**. The relationships show that CWE-312 is the most specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe257[\"CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe257 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe257,cwe497 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses starts with the **storage of administrator credentials in plaintext** (CWE-312). A locally authenticated attacker is able to **read files** on the system and retrieve the credentials. This leads to **information exposure** and ultimately allows the attacker to **elevate their privileges** on the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several potential CWEs, including CWE-522, CWE-257, CWE-250, and CWE-497. However, after reviewing the vulnerability description and the provided CWE specifications, it became clear that CWE-312 **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** is the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states that administrator credentials are **stored in plaintext**. This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-312, which states that \"The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\"\n\nThe other CWEs were considered but ultimately deemed less appropriate:\n\n*   CWE-522 **Insufficiently Protected Credentials** is a broader category that encompasses various insecure methods of storing or transmitting credentials, but the vulnerability description specifically mentions plaintext storage, making CWE-312 a more precise fit.\n*   CWE-257 **Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format** is similar to CWE-312, but it implies that the passwords might be encrypted but easily recoverable. The vulnerability description does not mention any encryption, so CWE-312 is a better fit.\n*   CWE-497 **Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere** is a more general weakness related to the exposure of system information. While the plaintext credentials do constitute sensitive system information, CWE-312 more directly addresses the specific issue of storing credentials in plaintext.\n\nThe selection of CWE-312 is based on the explicit evidence in the vulnerability description. The relationship analysis further supports this decision, as CWE-312 is a child of CWE-522, indicating a more specific classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: N/A\n**Source**: N/A\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
