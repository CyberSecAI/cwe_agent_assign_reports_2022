CWE-416 can also precede CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size) and CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition). CWE-787 is a base CWE that can result from CWE-416.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe120\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe123\n    cwe787 -->|CANRESULTFROM| cwe416\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe825,cwe120,cwe123 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **use after free** (CWE-416), which can lead to **memory corruption**. This **memory corruption** can then potentially lead to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) if the freed memory is reallocated and subsequently overwritten.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates a **use after free** condition in the m4u component, which leads to **memory corruption** and local escalation of privilege. The primary CWE is therefore CWE-416 (Use After Free), as it directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The description from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the m4u (memory management unit) component.\" and \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free (CWE-416).\"\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is considered as a secondary candidate because a use-after-free can lead to memory corruption by overwriting the freed memory. While the vulnerability description mentions **memory corruption**, it does not explicitly state an out-of-bounds write. Thus, CWE-787 is a potential consequence of the use-after-free, but not the primary weakness.\n\nThe choice of CWE-416 is based on the explicit mention of \"use after free\" in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The retriever results also list CWE-416 as a relevant CWE. The mapping guidance for CWE-416 allows its use at the Variant level of abstraction.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but ultimately not selected as primary candidates. CWE-662 and CWE-667 (Improper Synchronization and Locking) were considered due to the concurrent nature of memory management, but the primary issue is the use of freed memory, not a synchronization problem. CWE-1260 (Improper Handling of Overlap Between Protected Memory Ranges) was considered, but the description does not indicate any issues with overlapping memory regions. CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition) and CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) were also considered, but the description does not provide enough evidence to support these. CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource) and CWE-665 (Improper Initialization) are not applicable because the memory was freed, not uninitialized.",
