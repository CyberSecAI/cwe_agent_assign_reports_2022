Although the mapping guidance discourages its use, the evidence points directly to an authentication issue. CWE-287's parent is CWE-284, Improper Access Control. Several child CWEs of CWE-287 were considered, including CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication). CWE-306 was deemed less suitable as authentication was present, albeit flawed. CWE-1390 is a valid candidate and considered as a secondary CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **insecure configuration** (LDAP with anonymous binding enabled), leading to an **authentication bypass**, and finally resulting in **unauthorized access** and potential **data manipulation**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the ability to bypass authentication using an empty password string when the system is configured to use LDAP with anonymous binding.\n\nThe following evidence supports this assessment:\n\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** \"**impact:** bypass authentication mechanisms\", \"**vector:** empty password string\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"The core weakness is the ability to bypass the intended authentication mechanism when the system is configured to use LDAP with anonymous binding enabled.\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"The vulnerability is not inherent in the code, but arises due to an insecure configuration that the software supports. The software does not require LDAP to require authenticated binding which allows anonymous binding.\"\n\nCWE-287, Improper Authentication, was chosen as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the core issue of bypassing the authentication mechanism. While the MITRE mapping guidance discourages using CWE-287 directly, preferring more specific entries, none of the child CWEs perfectly fit the scenario. CWE-1390, Weak Authentication, is a secondary candidate.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the available information. While a more specific CWE might exist, the current evidence best supports CWE-287 and CWE-1390.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n## CWE-1236: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV
