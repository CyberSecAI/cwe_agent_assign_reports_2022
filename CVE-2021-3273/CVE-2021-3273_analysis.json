The vulnerability description explicitly states that the Nagios XI component `/nagiosxi/admin/graphtemplates.php` is affected by **code injection**. The provided evidence strongly supports classifying this vulnerability as CWE-94.\n\nThe selection of CWE-94 is based on the following:\n  - The vulnerability description mentions \"**code injection**\".\n  - The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section identifies \"**code injection**\" as the **weakness**.\n  - The CVE Reference Links Content Summary shows multiple instances of **code injection** in Nagios products due to improper input validation.\n\nCWE-94 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred. The alternative CWEs considered, like CWE-78, CWE-79, and CWE-89, relate to OS command injection, XSS, and SQL injection, respectively. However, the primary weakness is the **improper control of code generation**, which aligns directly with CWE-94.\n\nThe final decision is to classify this vulnerability as CWE-94 due to the explicit mention of **code injection** in the vulnerability description and its direct relevance to the CWE description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This entry is frequently misused for vulnerabilities with a technical impact of \"code execution,\" which does not by itself indicate a root cause weakness, since dozens of weaknesses can enable code execution.",
