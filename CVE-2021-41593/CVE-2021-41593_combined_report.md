## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-770, which describes the **allocation of resources without limits or throttling**. This is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-400, which is uncontrolled resource consumption. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was also considered but not chosen as the primary because the root cause is not primarily about information exposure but about the **uncontrolled allocation of HTLC resources**. The relationship between CWE-770 and CWE-400 helps refine the classification to the more specific issue of uncontrolled resource allocation.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is as follows:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Uncontrolled allocation of dust HTLCs** due to **insufficient validation** of dust limits during channel opening. This aligns with CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling).
2.  **Weakness:** The BOLT specification **lacked a requirement for counterparty verification** of dust limits.
3.  **Weakness:** Implementations **didn't enforce a limit on the sum of in-flight HTLCs**.
4.  **Weakness:** Attackers could **manipulate the `update_fee` mechanism** to increase funds at risk.
5.  **Impact:** **Loss of funds** due to dust HTLC exposure.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the vulnerability description and the provided CVE reference content summary. The core issue is the **dust HTLC exposure**, leading to a **loss of funds**. The content highlights the **lack of proper limits** on dust HTLCs as the root cause.

The selection of CWE-770 is based on the evidence from the CVE reference content summary, which states: "Implementations didn't enforce a limit on the sum of in-flight HTLCs that could be trimmed as fees." This directly supports the **allocation of resources without limits**.

The graph relationships influenced the decision by highlighting the connection between CWE-770 and the broader category of CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption). While CWE-400 is relevant, CWE-770 provides a more specific classification that aligns with the technical details of the vulnerability.

The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-770 directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **uncontrolled allocation of HTLC resources**. It's more specific than CWE-400 and more accurate than CWE-200, which focuses on the impact (information exposure) rather than the cause (**uncontrolled resource allocation**).

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-41593

## Vulnerability Description
Lightning Labs lnd before 0.13.3-beta allows loss of funds because of **dust HTLC exposure**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **dust HTLC exposure**
- **impact:** loss of funds
- **product:** Lightning Labs lnd
- **version:** before 0.13.3-beta

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described and its relation to CVE-2021-41593:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   The content directly relates to CVE-2021-41593. It details a vulnerability in the Lightning Network protocol related to dust HTLC exposure, which is the core issue described in the CVE. The content explains how a malicious actor can exploit the lack of proper limits on dust HTLCs to cause a loss of funds for their counterparty.  The content from lists.linuxfoundation.org explicitly mentions "CVE-2021-41593" and its impact on c-lightning and LND.
   
**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - **Insufficient Dust Limit Validation:** The BOLT specification allows a party (Alice) to set a `dust_limit_satoshis` value for their commitment transactions. This value determines the threshold below which an HTLC is considered "dust" and gets trimmed to fees. The specification lacked a requirement for the counterparty (Bob) to verify if Alice's declared dust limit was excessively high during channel opening.
   - **Lack of Aggregate Dust Limit:** Implementations didn't enforce a limit on the sum of in-flight HTLCs that could be trimmed as fees. This allowed an attacker to repeatedly send dust HTLCs, effectively burning a significant portion of the victim's funds.
   - **Fee Manipulation:** Attackers could also exploit the `update_fee` mechanism to increase the amount of funds at risk. By manipulating the negotiated feerate, they could cause more HTLCs to fall under the dust limit, especially if a mempool spike occurs, and a victim doesn't react fast enough to update the channel fees.
   - **Exploitation at `update_fee` Reception:** The vulnerability is further exacerbated at `update_fee` reception. The amount at risk is directly correlated with current mempool feerates, making it possible for an attacker to induce a much larger loss with a spike in network fees.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Unrestricted Dust Limit:** A malicious party can set an excessively high dust limit.
   - **Accumulated Dust Exposure:** No limit on the total amount of dust HTLCs, that can be converted into miner fees on a commitment transaction.
   - **Feerate Sensitivity:** The amount at risk depends on the current mempool feerate which can be manipulated.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Fee Blackmailing:** Attackers can hold funds hostage, demanding ransom for resolving the in-flight HTLCs.
   - **Liquidity Burning:** Attackers can burn liquidity of competing Lightning Service Providers (LSPs), disrupting their services.
   - **Balance Theft:** In combination with mining capabilities or a rogue mining pool, the attacker can effectively steal the counterparty's channel balance by burning HTLCs as miner fees, and not resolving them. This can lead to a complete loss of funds for the victim, especially during a channel force-close where the dust HTLCs become miner fees on the commitment transaction.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Channel Opening:** Attackers set a high dust limit during the channel opening process to maximize their attack potential.
   - **HTLC Routing:**  Attackers route dust HTLCs through the victim's channel and prevent their resolution. They may use circular routing and withhold preimage information.
   -  **`update_fee` Manipulation:** Attackers propose `update_fee` with higher than usual feerates, causing a greater portion of in-flight HTLCs to be trimmed to dust.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Lightning Node Operator:** The attacker needs to be a Lightning Network node operator with the ability to open and route HTLCs through channels.
   - **Mining Capability (Optional):** For the most severe form of the attack (stealing counterparty balance), the attacker needs to collude with a miner or have mining capabilities themselves to ensure the publishing of the attacker's commitment transaction without broadcasting it to the wider network until the HTLC time locks expire.
   - **Network Connection:** The attacker needs to be able to connect and interact with the targeted node on the Lightning Network, either directly or through an intermediary node.
   - **Control over HTLC Resolution:**  The attacker needs to control the resolution (revealing preimage) of the HTLCs.
   - **Ability to Manipulate Feerates:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the negotiated feerate through `update_fee` messages.

**Additional Details (Beyond the CVE Description):**

-   The content provides a detailed explanation of how the "dust limit" parameter works in Lightning channels and how it can be abused.
-   It describes real-world attack scenarios and the motivation behind them (ransom, competition sabotage).
-   It outlines the victim's experience and the lack of effective countermeasures.
-   It details the steps being taken for mitigations, and some suggested parameters.
-   It also lists a timeline for the vulnerability discovery, and remediation.

In summary, the provided content accurately describes the vulnerability addressed by CVE-2021-41593, including its root cause, weaknesses, impact, attack vectors, and attacker requirements. It also provides significant technical details that go beyond the basic CVE description.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

### Extended Description


Code frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.

ChildOf -> CWE-400

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..
- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.




## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

### Extended Description


There are many different kinds of mistakes that introduce information exposures. The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include:


  - private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details

  - system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages

  - business secrets and intellectual property

  - network status and configuration

  - the product's own code or internal state

  - metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers

  - indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider

Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include:

  - the product's own users

  - people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users

  - the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates

  - the developer

Information exposures can occur in different ways:

  - the code  **explicitly inserts**  sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been "scrubbed" or "sanitized"

  - a different weakness or mistake  **indirectly inserts**  the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.

  - the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are  **unintentionally made accessible**  to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.

It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an "information exposure," but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

### Alternative Terms
Information Disclosure: This term is frequently used in vulnerability advisories to describe a consequence or technical impact, for any vulnerability that has a loss of confidentiality. Often, CWE-200 can be misused to represent the loss of confidentiality, even when the mistake - i.e., the weakness - is not directly related to the mishandling of the information itself, such as an out-of-bounds read that accesses sensitive memory contents; here, the out-of-bounds read is the primary weakness, not the disclosure of the memory. In addition, this phrase is also used frequently in policies and legal documents, but it does not refer to any disclosure of security-relevant information.
Information Leak: This is a frequently used term, however the "leak" term has multiple uses within security. In some cases it deals with the accidental exposure of information from a different weakness, but in other cases (such as "memory leak"), this deals with improper tracking of resources, which can lead to exhaustion. As a result, CWE is actively avoiding usage of the "leak" term.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].
**Comments:** If an error or mistake causes information to be disclosed, then use the CWE ID for that error. Consider starting with improper authorization (CWE-285), insecure permissions (CWE-732), improper authentication (CWE-287), etc. Also consider children such as Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201), Observable Discrepancy (CWE-203), Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory (CWE-538), or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As a result of mapping analysis in the 2020 Top 25 and more recent versions, this weakness is under review, since it is frequently misused in mapping to cover many problems that lead to loss of confidentiality. See Mapping Notes, Extended Description, and Alternate Terms.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31162:** Rust library leaks Oauth client details in application debug logs
- **CVE-2021-25476:** Digital Rights Management (DRM) capability for mobile platform leaks pointer information, simplifying ASLR bypass
- **CVE-2001-1483:** Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses




## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses




## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.

### Extended Description


Integrated circuits and hardware engines can expose accesses to assets (device configuration, keys, etc.) to trusted firmware or a software module (commonly set by BIOS/bootloader). This access is typically access-controlled. Upon a power reset, the hardware or system usually starts with default values in registers, and the trusted firmware (Boot firmware) configures the necessary access-control protection.


A common weakness that can exist in such protection schemes is that access controls or policies are not granular enough. This condition allows agents beyond trusted agents to access assets and could lead to a loss of functionality or the ability to set up the device securely. This further results in security risks from leaked, sensitive, key material to modification of device configuration.

- **CVE-2022-24985:** A form hosting website only checks the session authentication status for a single form, making it possible to bypass authentication when there are multiple forms
- **CVE-2021-36934:** An operating system has an overly permission Access Control List onsome system files, including those related to user passwords




## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

### Extended Description


Network-based products, such as web applications, often run on top of an operating system or similar environment. When the product communicates with outside parties, details about the underlying system are expected to remain hidden, such as path names for data files, other OS users, installed packages, the application environment, etc. This system information may be provided by the product itself, or buried within diagnostic or debugging messages. Debugging information helps an adversary learn about the system and form an attack plan.


An information exposure occurs when system data or debugging information leaves the program through an output stream or logging function that makes it accessible to unauthorized parties. Using other weaknesses, an attacker could cause errors to occur; the response to these errors can reveal detailed system information, along with other impacts. An attacker can use messages that reveal technologies, operating systems, and product versions to tune the attack against known vulnerabilities in these technologies. A product may use diagnostic methods that provide significant implementation details such as stack traces as part of its error handling mechanism.

## CWE-1384: Improper Handling of Physical or Environmental Conditions
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not properly handle unexpected physical or environmental conditions that occur naturally or are artificially induced.

### Extended Description


Hardware products are typically only guaranteed to behave correctly within certain physical limits or environmental conditions. Such products cannot necessarily control the physical or external conditions to which they are subjected. However, the inability to handle such conditions can undermine a product's security. For example, an unexpected physical or environmental condition may cause the flipping of a bit that is used for an authentication decision. This unexpected condition could occur naturally or be induced artificially by an adversary.


Physical or environmental conditions of concern are:


  -  **Atmospheric characteristics: ** extreme temperature ranges, etc.

  -  **Interference: ** electromagnetic interference (EMI), radio frequency interference (RFI), etc.

  -  **Assorted light sources: ** white light, ultra-violet light (UV), lasers, infrared (IR), etc.

  -  **Power variances: ** under-voltages, over-voltages, under-current, over-current, etc.

  -  **Clock variances: ** glitching, overclocking, clock stretching, etc.

  -  **Component aging and degradation** 

  -  **Materials manipulation: ** focused ion beams (FIB), etc.

  -  **Exposure to radiation: ** x-rays, cosmic radiation, etc.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-17391:** Lack of anti-glitch protections allows an attacker to launch a physical attack to bypass the secure boot and read protected eFuses.




## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

### Extended Description


When resources are released, they can be made available for reuse. For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.


Even when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.


This weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).

**[Maintenance]** This entry needs modification to clarify the differences with CWE-212. The description also combines two problems that are distinct from the CWE research perspective: the inadvertent transfer of information to another sphere, and improper initialization/shutdown. Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.

**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release
- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.
- **CVE-2003-0291:** router does not clear information from DHCP packets that have been previously used




## CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When trying to keep information confidential, an attacker can often infer some of the information by using statistics.

### Extended Description
In situations where data should not be tied to individual users, but a large number of users should be able to make queries that "scrub" the identity of users, it may be possible to get information about a user -- e.g., by specifying search terms that are known to be unique to that user.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1230

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** 

The relationship between CWE-202 and CWE-612 needs to be investigated more closely, as they may be different descriptions of the same kind of problem. CWE-202 is also being considered for deprecation, as it is not clearly described and may have been misunderstood by CWE users. It could be argued that this issue is better covered by CAPEC; an attacker can utilize their data-query privileges to perform this kind of operation, and if the attacker should not be allowed to perform the operation - or if the sensitive data should not have been made accessible at all - then that is more appropriately classified as a separate CWE related to authorization (see the parent, CWE-1230).




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-41935:** Wiki product allows an adversary to discover filenames via a series of queries starting with one letter and then iteratively extending the match.




## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Privacy violation
Privacy leak
Privacy leakage

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-200

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry overlaps many other entries that are not organized around the kind of sensitive information that is exposed. However, because privacy is treated with such importance due to regulations and other factors, and it may be useful for weakness-finding tools to highlight capabilities that detect personal private information instead of system information, it is not clear whether - and how - this entry should be deprecated.

**[Other]** 

There are many types of sensitive information that products must protect from attackers, including system data, communications, configuration, business secrets, intellectual property, and an individual's personal (private) information. Private personal information may include a password, phone number, geographic location, personal messages, credit card number, etc. Private information is important to consider whether the person is a user of the product, or part of a data set that is processed by the product. An exposure of private information does not necessarily prevent the product from working properly, and in fact the exposure might be intended by the developer, e.g. as part of data sharing with other organizations. However, the exposure of personal private information can still be undesirable or explicitly prohibited by law or regulation.


Some types of private information include:


  - Government identifiers, such as Social Security Numbers

  - Contact information, such as home addresses and telephone numbers

  - Geographic location - where the user is (or was)

  - Employment history

  - Financial data - such as credit card numbers, salary, bank accounts, and debts

  - Pictures, video, or audio

  - Behavioral patterns - such as web surfing history, when certain activities are performed, etc.

  - Relationships (and types of relationships) with others - family, friends, contacts, etc.

  - Communications - e-mail addresses, private messages, text messages, chat logs, etc.

  - Health - medical conditions, insurance status, prescription records

  - Account passwords and other credentials

Some of this information may be characterized as PII (Personally Identifiable Information), Protected Health Information (PHI), etc. Categories of private information may overlap or vary based on the intended usage or the policies and practices of a particular industry.

Sometimes data that is not labeled as private can have a privacy implication in a different context. For example, student identification numbers are usually not considered private because there is no explicit and publicly-available mapping to an individual student's personal information. However, if a school generates identification numbers based on student social security numbers, then the identification numbers should be considered private.
