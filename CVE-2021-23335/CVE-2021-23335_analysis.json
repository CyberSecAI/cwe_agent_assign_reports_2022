CWE-20 is a more generic class that can precede CWE-74 and CWE-90 but is less specific. The abstraction level of CWE-90 is Base, which is the preferred level for root cause analysis.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe90[\"CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization Across a Trust Boundary\"]\n    \n    cwe90 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe90 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n    cwe74 -->|CANBEPRECEDEDBY| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe90 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is:\n1.  **Root Cause:** Lack of proper input sanitization leading to CWE-90.\n2.  **Weakness:** LDAP Injection.\n3.  **Impact:** Authentication bypass and information exposure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly states that the vulnerability is due to **LDAP injection** because of a **lack of proper input sanitization**. The CVE reference summary further corroborates this, stating that the root cause is a **lack of proper input sanitization** when constructing LDAP queries, making user-provided input susceptible to injection attacks. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-90, \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\".\n\nCWE-90 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred. The retriever results also list CWE-90 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-74, \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\", was considered because CWE-90 is a child of CWE-74. However, CWE-74 is a more general Class-level CWE. Since the specific vulnerability is **LDAP injection**, CWE-90 is a more precise and appropriate classification. While CWE-74 could be considered a secondary CWE, it is discouraged by its usage notes.\n\nCWE-20, \"Improper Input Validation\" was considered because input validation is often related to injection vulnerabilities. However, CWE-20 is too general and is often misused when lower-level CWEs are more appropriate. The core issue is the improper neutralization of special elements in the LDAP query, which is directly addressed by CWE-90.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or

vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**:

attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible

Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or",
