This indicates that CWE-1333 is a more specific case of inefficient algorithms. The relationship between CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) and CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) also played a role, as CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400, further specifying the type of resource consumption issue. The abstraction levels influenced the decision by favoring Base-level CWEs for their specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407,cwe770,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **inefficient regular expression** (CWE-1333), which leads to excessive CPU consumption, ultimately resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The **lack of limits on resource allocation** (CWE-770) could exacerbate the problem, as the system may allocate more resources to the regex processing than it should, further contributing to the DoS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **inefficient regular expression** used in the GJSON library. The vulnerability description and CVE details explicitly mention the **regular expression denial of service (ReDoS)** attack, making CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity) the most appropriate primary CWE. The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"The vulnerability stems from the use of the `match.Match` function within the `gjson` library. This function is susceptible to regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) attacks when processing crafted JSON inputs with specific patterns.\"\n\nThe secondary CWE, CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), was considered because the vulnerability could be amplified by the **lack of limits on resource allocation** for processing the regular expression. However, since the primary issue is the inefficient regex itself, CWE-1333 is the more direct and accurate mapping.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1333 is based on the direct evidence of the ReDoS vulnerability and the CWE's description aligning with the vulnerability details. The CWE is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it directly addresses the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
