## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-319, which represents the core issue of transmitting sensitive information in cleartext. CWE-522 is a parent Class of CWE-319 and represents a broader category of credential protection issues. CWE-312, Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information, is related as credentials exposed during transmission are often also stored insecurely.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **mishandling of the userinfo subcomponent of a URI**, leading to the **transmission of cleartext credentials** via SNI. The chain can be described as: **Improper URI Parsing** -> **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information**.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is the exposure of cleartext credentials during transmission, making **CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information)** the most appropriate choice.

Evidence supporting this includes:
- "Lynx through 2.8.9 **mishandles the userinfo subcomponent of a URI**, which allows remote attackers to discover cleartext credentials because they may appear in SNI data."
- "The root cause lies in how Lynx handles the userinfo subcomponent of a URI (e.g., `https://user:pass@host/`). Specifically, the `HTParse()` function does not correctly parse the authentication part of the URI, leading to the inclusion of cleartext credentials in TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) data"
- "Credentials passed in the URI are sent in clear text, specifically in the SNI field of the TLS handshake, before any encryption is established."

CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) was considered, since it is the parent of CWE-319. However, it is less specific, so CWE-319 is the better choice. CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) was also considered, as the exposed credentials could potentially be stored in cleartext elsewhere. However, the immediate vulnerability is the transmission, not necessarily the storage.

CWE-113 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')) was considered due to the mention of HTTP headers, but the core issue is not related to CRLF injection. Instead, it's about the mishandling of URI components and the resulting exposure of credentials in cleartext. CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)) was considered due to the network request aspect, but is unrelated to the root cause. CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) is irrelevant as the issue isn't related to web page generation or script injection.

The final selection is based on the fact that the credentials are being transmitted in cleartext via SNI. CWE-319 is the best fit because it directly addresses this issue.
