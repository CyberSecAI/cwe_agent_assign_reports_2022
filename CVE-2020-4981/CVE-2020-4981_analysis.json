The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" further supports this by stating, \"The vulnerability is due to insecure external command execution within IBM Spectrum Scale CSI\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Insecure external command execution.\" However, the description lacks specific details about the type of input that is not being properly validated, which makes it difficult to choose a more specific CWE.\n\nCWE-20, **Improper Input Validation**, is a Class-level CWE that describes a situation where a product receives input but does not validate that the input has the properties required to process the data safely and correctly. The \"Mapping Guidance\" for CWE-20 states that it is \"Discouraged\" because it is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports and suggests considering lower-level children.
