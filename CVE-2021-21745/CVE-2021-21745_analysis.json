The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the absence of CSRF verification as the root cause of the **authentication bypass**. CWE-285 [Improper Authorization] is considered as a secondary candidate because the end result is unauthorized actions, but the root cause is the missing CSRF protection. CWE-352 requires missing or insufficient session expiration (CWE-613), lack of anti-automation (CWE-441), improper validation of referrer (CWE-346), and weaknesses in state management (CWE-642).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe346[\"CWE-346: Origin Validation\"]\n    cwe441[\"CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary\"]\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n    cwe642[\"CWE-642: External Control of Critical State Data\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe346\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe441\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe613\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe642\n    cwe352 -->|CAN_RESULT_IN| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe346,cwe441,cwe613,cwe642,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing CSRF protection** (CWE-352), which allows an attacker to trick a user into making an unintentional request.
