## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-1284, which has a child relationship to CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). The vulnerability involves a lack of proper validation of the UTCTime data, which specifies a quantity (length of time). CWE-476 was considered due to the potential for a NULL pointer dereference if the input is not validated, but it is not the primary cause. The abstraction level of CWE-1284 is Base, which is preferred.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper validation** of the UTCTime data (**CWE-1284**). This leads to the parsing of malformed UTCTime input, where the second character is above 0x7F. The impact of this is a panic, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis indicates that the root cause of the vulnerability is the **improper validation** of the UTCTime data, which specifies a quantity. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" states that the "**vulnerability arises from a faulty string slice operation** within the `from_der_` function of the `simple_asn1` crate when parsing the ASN.1 "UTCTime" format" and "**The usage of string slicing without proper UTF-8 validation is the core weakness**."

The evidence supports classifying this as **CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input)**. The vulnerability description mentions that the panic occurs when "UTCTime data, supplied by a remote attacker, has a second character greater than 0x7f." The quantity here is the length of the UTCTime string, and the code **fails to validate** that the characters are within the valid range.

Other CWEs Considered but Not Used:

*   CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference): While a NULL pointer dereference could occur due to invalid input, it's not the direct cause of the vulnerability. The primary issue is the lack of validation.
*   CWE-191 (Integer Underflow): While integer underflow is a possibility when dealing with lengths, there's no direct evidence of this from the description.
*   CWE-117 (Improper Output Neutralization for Logs): Not relevant as the issue is not related to logging.
*   CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences): Not relevant as the vulnerability is not a CRLF injection issue.
*   CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization): Not relevant as the vulnerability doesn't involve concurrency issues.

The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause, which is the **improper validation** of the input data's specified quantity.

**Abstraction

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-45711

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in the simple_asn1 crate 0.6.0 before 0.6.1 for Rust. There is a panic if UTCTime data, supplied by a remote attacker, has a second character greater than 0x7f.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** panic
- **vector:** UTCTime data with second character greater than 0x7f
- **attacker:** remote attacker
- **product:** simple_asn1 crate
- **version:** 0.6.0 before 0.6.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from a faulty string slice operation within the `from_der_` function of the `simple_asn1` crate when parsing the ASN.1 "UTCTime" format.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing malformed UTCTime inputs where the first character is ASCII, and the second is above 0x7F.  This leads to an attempt to slice into the middle of a UTF-8 character. This results in a panic. The usage of string slicing without proper UTF-8 validation is the core weakness.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to the application panicking.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via malformed inputs to the parsing functions `from_der` and `der_decode`. The attacker provides a specially crafted UTCTime string within the ASN.1 data. This crate is frequently used with network inputs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to control the input data to the `simple_asn1` crate, specifically the UTCTime fields. Since this crate is frequently used with network inputs, an attacker in a position to inject or manipulate network traffic can exploit this.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Often, indexable resources such as memory buffers or files can be accessed using a specific position, index, or offset, such as an index for an array or a position for a file. When untrusted input is not properly validated before it is used as an index, attackers could access (or attempt to access) unauthorized portions of these resources. This could be used to cause buffer overflows, excessive resource allocation, or trigger unexpected failures.

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

### Extended Description


A race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.


A race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:


  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.

  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.

A race condition exists when an "interfering code sequence" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.

The interfering code sequence could be "trusted" or "untrusted." A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.

**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.

**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.

**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples

## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.
