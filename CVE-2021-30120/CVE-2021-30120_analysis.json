CWE-603 is a more specific instance of this, focusing on authentication. CWE-603 is a ChildOf CWE-602, meaning it's a more specific type of the broader weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe602[\"CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security\"]\n    cwe603[\"CWE-603: Use of Client-Side Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe603 -->|CHILDOF| cwe602\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe602 primary\n    class cwe603 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the **incorrect enforcement of 2FA on the client-side**. This leads to the ability to **bypass the 2FA requirement** by manipulating client-side data. The final impact is **unauthorized access** to the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-602 as a strong candidate due to the **client-side enforcement of security**. Further review indicated that CWE-603 might also be applicable due to the specific focus on authentication.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the **2FA requirement is enforced client-side instead of server-side** and **can be bypassed using a local proxy**. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-602: \"The product is composed of a server that relies on the client to implement a mechanism that is intended to protect the server.\"\n\nThe analysis concludes that CWE-602 is the most appropriate primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the reliance on the client to enforce a security mechanism that should be handled by the server. CWE-603 is a relevant but less precise description of the authentication aspect. The choice of CWE-602 at the Class level provides a broader understanding of the weakness, while acknowledging the more specific authentication-related aspects.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
