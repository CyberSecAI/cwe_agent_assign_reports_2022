# Analysis for CVE-2021-0481

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-939 | Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The **unexpected URI handler** is the rootcause. |
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary candidate due to the authorization context.|

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-939 and CWE-862. CWE-939 is a more specific case of **missing authorization** related to custom URL schemes, which aligns with the vulnerability description. While CWE-862 is a broader category, CWE-939 provides a more precise classification. The relationships CANPRECEDE, CANFOLLOW, REQUIREDBY, REQUIRES, PEEROF and CANALSOBE did not appear to influence this selection.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **unexpected URI handler** (CWE-939), which leads to the access of unauthorized files, resulting in a local escalation of privilege.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified the **unexpected URI handler** as the root cause, which directly relates to **improper authorization** when handling custom URL schemes. The analysis also considered the potential for broader authorization issues (CWE-862) but determined that the more specific CWE-939 provides a more accurate representation of the vulnerability.

The decision is primarily based on the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" section, which identifies the **unexpected URI handler** as the root cause. Additionally, the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" mentions the improper handling of result URIs.

The selection of CWE-939 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **improper authorization** in the context of custom URL schemes, which is the core issue described in the vulnerability.
