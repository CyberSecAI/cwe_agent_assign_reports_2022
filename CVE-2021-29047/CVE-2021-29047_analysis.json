It is related to CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) through a ChildOf relationship. This means that a guessable CAPTCHA is a specific type of weak authentication. There are no CANPRECEDE or CANFOLLOW relationships that are relevant in this case. Choosing CWE-804 provides a more specific classification than its parent, CWE-1390.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe804[\"CWE-804: Guessable CAPTCHA\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe804 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe804 primary\n    class cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **rootcause**: **CAPTCHA answers are not invalidated after use**. This leads to the **impact**: repeatedly perform CAPTCHA-protected actions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **rootcause** of the vulnerability, which is that **CAPTCHA answers are not invalidated after use**. This directly leads to the ability to reuse the same CAPTCHA answer repeatedly, bypassing the intended protection.\n\nThe Retriever Results highlighted several potential CWEs, but CWE-804 (Guessable CAPTCHA) emerged as the most relevant due to its direct connection to the vulnerability description. The description states that the issue allows \"remote attackers to repeatedly perform actions protected by a CAPTCHA challenge by reusing the same CAPTCHA answer.\" This aligns closely with the definition of CWE-804, which describes a CAPTCHA that can be guessed or automatically recognized, effectively making it reusable.\n\nWhile CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) is a parent of CWE-804 and was also considered, it is less specific. The vulnerability isn't about a general weakness in the authentication process, but specifically about the CAPTCHA mechanism being bypassable due to reuse of the answer.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-804 is based on the clear evidence in the vulnerability description, the high relevance score in the Retriever Results, and the mapping guidance that recommends using the most specific CWE available. The final selection of CWE-804 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **rootcause** of the vulnerability (reusable CAPTCHA answers) and avoids generalizing to a broader authentication issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
