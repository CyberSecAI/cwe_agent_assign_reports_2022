CWE-79 is a Base level CWE. CWE-79 is a child of CWE-74. CWE-20 is a Class level CWE that can precede CWE-79. CWE-20 is a general case of **insufficient input validation** and is the root cause of the **cross-site scripting weakness**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient input validation** (CWE-20) which leads to **cross-site scripting** (CWE-79).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states the presence of a **cross-site scripting** (XSS) vulnerability in Cisco Webex Meetings due to **insufficient input validation**.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-79 is strong:\n*   Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**weakness:** **cross-site scripting**\" and \"**impact:** execute arbitrary script code and access sensitive browser information\"\n*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability\"\n\nThe evidence for CWE-20 is also strong:\n*   Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**rootcause:** **insufficient input validation**\"\n*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"Root cause of vulnerability: - **Insufficient validation** of user-supplied input by the web-based interface of Cisco Webex Meetings.\"\n\nCWE-79 is the most appropriate primary CWE because the description explicitly mentions **cross-site scripting**.\nCWE-20 could be considered a secondary CWE because the description indicates **insufficient input validation** as a root cause.

However, there is no evidence to suggest the type of **cross-site scripting** so this CWE is not selected.\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\nThis CWE was considered due to the **insufficient input validation** root cause and because it can precede CWE-79. While relevant, it is a high-level Class and the vulnerability is primarily due to the resultant **cross-site scripting**, so it is a secondary consideration at best.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\nThis CWE was considered because it related to neutralization and is a parent of CWE-79. However, it is a Class level CWE and there is no direct evidence to support this.\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\nThis CWE was considered due to the high retriever score but is not relevant because the vulnerability is a **cross-site scripting** vulnerability and not an HTTP Request/Response Splitting vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-1385: Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets\nThis CWE was considered due to the high retriever score but is not relevant because the vulnerability is a **cross-site scripting** vulnerability and not a WebSocket vulnerability.",
