CWE-122 is a secondary CWE, representing the heap-based buffer overflow that results from the integer overflow. CWE-190 can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), and CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). The abstraction levels are appropriate, with CWE-190 being a Base CWE and CWE-122 being a Variant CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n    class cwe787,cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a crafted file leading to a calculation where `ctx->hdr.frame_size` is smaller than `ctx->hdr.hdr_size`. This results in CWE-190, **Integer Overflow or Wraparound**, as `size` becomes a negative number. This negative value is then used in `memcpy`, leading to CWE-122, **Heap-based Buffer Overflow**.\n\nCrafted File ->  **size to be a negative number** (CWE-190) -> **heap overflow** in memcpy (CWE-122)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment and final conclusion are based on the provided evidence, including the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary. The vulnerability description key phrases also highlight the **negative number** and **heap overflow** as key indicators.\n\nThe vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow in the `adts_dmx_process` function. Specifically, the code calculates a size value, and if `ctx->hdr.frame_size` is smaller than `ctx->hdr.hdr_size`, the resulting `size` becomes negative due to integer wraparound. This negative value is then passed to `memcpy`, which interprets it as a very large unsigned value, leading to a heap overflow.\n\nCWE-190 accurately captures the root cause where the calculation results in an integer overflow or wraparound, causing `size` to become negative. The supporting evidence is the vulnerability description stating \"**size to be a negative number**\" and the CVE reference links content summary mentioning \"If `ctx->hdr.frame_size` is smaller than `ctx->hdr.hdr_size`, the `size` variable becomes negative due to integer underflow.\"\n\nCWE-122 is selected because the negative size is then used in a `memcpy` operation, resulting in a heap overflow. The vulnerability description key phrases highlight \"**heap overflow**\" as a key indicator.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-190 being a Base CWE and CWE-122 being a Variant CWE that provides more detail about the location of the buffer overflow.\n\nThe following CWEs were considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound) - While the CVE reference summary states \"integer underflow\", CWE-190 more accurately represents what happened in the memcpy operation\n*   CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error - This is not a truncation issue, but rather an overflow/wraparound.\n*   CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types - While there might be implicit type conversions, the core issue is the integer overflow, not the conversion itself.\n*   CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input - The code doesn't validate the calculated size, but the root cause is the integer overflow, not the missing validation.\n*   CWE-126: Buffer Over-read - The issue is an out-of-bounds write, not read.\n*   CWE-195: Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error - While a signed integer might be converted to unsigned, the overflow is the primary issue.\n*   CWE-839: Numeric Range Comparison Without Minimum Check - Not applicable, as the issue is not a missing minimum check, but rather an overflow.\n*   CWE-194: Unexpected Sign Extension - This is not a sign extension issue.\nRelevant CWE Information:",
