The vulnerability description indicates a problem with authorization, and while it could be argued that authorization is completely missing (CWE-862), it's more accurate to say the authorization is **improper** (CWE-285) as users with contributor roles are granted access they should not have.  CWE-425, **Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')**, is also a related Base CWE that applies when authorization is not adequately enforced on restricted URLs, scripts, or files, such as accessing draft posts.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe288\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe862,cwe863,cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper authorization** implementation in the WordPress plugin. This leads to the impact of unauthorized access to draft, private, password-protected, and trashed posts/pages by users with contributor roles. The ability for low-level users to bypass intended restrictions results in information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **rootcause** as an **improper authorization**, leading to unauthorized access to restricted content. The evidence from the vulnerability description is clear: \"The Page/Post Content Shortcode WordPress plugin through 1.0 does not have proper authorisation in place, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to access draft/private/password protected/trashed posts/pages they should not be allowed to...\". This maps directly to CWE-285 **Improper Authorization**, as the authorization checks are not correctly implemented, leading to unintended access.\n\nThe retriever results suggested CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) and CWE-862 (**Missing Authorization**). While both are related, the vulnerability description suggests that authorization is present but flawed, making CWE-285 a more accurate representation than **Missing Authorization**. If authorization was entirely absent, CWE-862 would be more appropriate. Similarly, the authorization logic is present but incorrect, suggesting CWE-863 could apply. CWE-425 (**Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')**) is applicable because the plugin does not adequately enforce authorization on all restricted content.\n\nThe final decision prioritizes CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**) as the primary CWE because it is a Class CWE that encompasses both **missing** and **incorrect** authorization scenarios. Since the plugin has some level of authorization in place, but it is flawed, CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) is also applicable. CWE-862 (**Missing Authorization**) is less applicable because authorization is not completely missing, but the retriever result suggests it should be considered. CWE-425 (**Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')**) applies because the plugin allows direct access to content that should be restricted. These selections provide the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n  - Description: The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n  - Usage: Discouraged, but selected due to being a good top level description.\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n  - Description: The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n  - Usage: Allowed-with-Review, but less descriptive as authorization is in place.\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n  - Description: The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n  - Usage: Allowed-with-Review, good descritption.\n- CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n  - Description: The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n  - Usage: Allowed, relevant because authorization is not adequately enforced on restricted content.",
