It is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). CWE-413 is a related concern about resource locking, and it's a child of CWE-667 (Improper Locking).\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1274[\"CWE-1274: Improper Access Control for Volatile Memory Containing Boot Code\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe413[\"CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    \n    cwe1274 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe413 -->|CHILDOF| cwe667\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1274 primary\n    class cwe413 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain begins with an **improper system call sequence** (the **root cause**) that allows a non-secure boot loader to unlock and modify memory. This leads to the memory region becoming an untrusted source of input for the secure boot loader. The **improper access control** (CWE-1274) over the volatile memory allows the modification of boot code, which can bypass the secure boot process and lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the **improper system call sequence** was hard to pin down, so looking at the retriever results for potential CWEs was key. The primary driver for selecting CWE-1274 is that the vulnerability description states that locked memory can be unlocked and modified by a non-secure boot loader. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-1274: \"The product conducts a secure-boot process... but it does not have sufficient access control or other protections for the Volatile Memory.\"\n\nThe phrase \"**improper system call sequence**\" from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" suggests a breakdown in access control mechanisms. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-413 (Improper Resource Locking) as a potential candidate.\n\nCWE-413 could be a contributing factor, but it doesn't fully capture the essence of the vulnerability, which involves the specific context of secure boot loaders and volatile memory. Therefore, I'm classifying CWE-1274 as the primary CWE and CWE-413 as a secondary concern.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction
