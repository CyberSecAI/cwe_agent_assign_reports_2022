While it would be ideal to find a more specific base or variant CWE, the description focuses on the use of **weak ciphers** for NETCONF over SSH, which directly aligns with the general concept of using a flawed cryptographic approach. CWE-327 is a child of CWE-693 \"Protection Mechanism Failure\". CWE-200 \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\" is a class-level CWE that represents the impact of the **weakness**, but not the root cause. It is the parent of CWE-497 \"Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\".\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe327 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe693,cwe497 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of weak ciphers** (CWE-327), leading to the potential for a remote attacker to intercept network data and **obtain sensitive information** (CWE-200). The root cause is the inadequate cryptographic algorithm, and the impact is the **exposure** of sensitive data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-327 as the primary candidate due to the explicit mention of **weak ciphers** in the vulnerability description. The retriever results also ranked CWE-327 as the top combined result. The vulnerability description states: \"An **Information Exposure** vulnerability in Juniper Networks SRC Series devices configured for NETCONF over SSH permits the negotiation of **weak ciphers**, which could allow a remote attacker to **obtain sensitive information**.\"\n\nCWE-200 was considered, but ultimately deemed less appropriate because it represents the impact (**information exposure**) rather than the root cause (**weak ciphers**). While the vulnerability description highlights information exposure, the underlying issue is the cryptographic **weakness**.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-327 is based on the evidence directly pointing to the **use of weak ciphers**, and the retriever results ranking it as the most relevant CWE. The \"Mapping Guidance\" for CWE-327 advises examining child entries for a better fit, but no child entry is more specific to the **use of weak ciphers** in NETCONF over SSH. Therefore, CWE-327 is the most appropriate at the Class level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before
