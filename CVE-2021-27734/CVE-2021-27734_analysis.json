It is a child of CWE-1390, Weak Authentication, and could be preceded by CWE-287, Improper Authentication. Selecting CWE-620 offers the most specific representation of the vulnerability where an attacker can change the credentials of existing users without proper verification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe620[\"CWE-620: Unverified Password Change\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe620 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe287 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe620\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe620 primary\n    class cwe1390,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of verification** during the password change process.\n  - The root cause is the **missing check** for the existing password or alternative authentication.\n  - This leads to the impact of unauthorized credential changes.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **ability to change user credentials without proper verification**. The vulnerability description states that remote attackers can \"change the credentials of existing users,\" pointing directly to a flaw in the password change mechanism.\n\nCWE-620, Unverified Password Change, aligns perfectly with this description. It specifies a scenario where \"the product does not require knowledge of the original password, or using another form of authentication\" when setting a new password. This directly mirrors the described vulnerability, making it the most appropriate choice. The evidence for this selection comes directly from the vulnerability description: \"allow remote attackers to change the credentials of existing users.\"\n\nThe Retriever Results also support this selection, with CWE-620 having a high score. While other CWEs like CWE-287, Improper Authentication, and CWE-1390, Weak Authentication, were considered, they are more general and less specific than CWE-620. CWE-287 is discouraged when more specific entries are available, and CWE-1390 is a Class-level CWE that could have a better Base-level child.\n\nTherefore, CWE-620 is chosen as the primary CWE because it accurately reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability, where the **lack of verification** during password changes allows unauthorized credential modification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
