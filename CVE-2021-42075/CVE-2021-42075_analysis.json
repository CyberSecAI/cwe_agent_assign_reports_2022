While CWE-772 [CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime] is a Base CWE and CWE-404 [CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release] is a Class CWE, CWE-775 [CWE-775: Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime] is more specific to the described vulnerability of missing file descriptor releases. There isn't a CANPRECEDE or CANFOLLOW in this case.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe775[\"CWE-775: Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe772[\"CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe775 -->|CHILDOF| cwe772\n    cwe775 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    cwe772 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe775 primary\n    class cwe772,cwe404,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to correctly close file descriptors**, which leads to file descriptor exhaustion, and ultimately results in a denial-of-service condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-775 [CWE-775: Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime] as the primary weakness due to the vulnerability description's focus on the **failure to close file descriptors**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports this by stating, \"The Barrier server component **does not correctly close file descriptors** for established TCP connections.\" This directly aligns with the description of CWE-775 [CWE-775: Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime], which is \"The product **does not release a file descriptor or handle after its effective lifetime** has ended, i.e., after the file descriptor/handle is no longer needed.\" The retriever results also list CWE-775 [CWE-775: Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime] as the top result.\n\nCWE-400 [CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption] was also considered, as the file descriptor exhaustion leads to denial of service. However, CWE-400 [CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption] is more of a consequence than the root cause. The mapping guidance for CWE-400 [CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption] even says it is discouraged because it is often misused and conflated with the technical impact of the vulnerability.\n\nTherefore, the selection of CWE-775 [CWE-775: Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime] is at the optimal level of specificity, accurately representing the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity

critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-833: Deadlock\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n-

does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage:
