While CWE-284 is a more general, high-level classification (Pillar), CWE-863 provides a more specific description of the authorization **failure** that led to the vulnerability. The relationship highlights the hierarchical nature of CWE classifications and guides the selection of the most appropriate level of detail.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves an **improper access control** mechanism, specifically an **incorrect authorization** check, that allows an authenticated remote attacker to access internal services.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the \"improper access control\" aspect of the vulnerability. The retriever results and the provided vulnerability description key phrases both point to CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). However, the MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-284 due to its high-level nature (Pillar) and recommends considering more specific descendants. The vulnerability description states that there is an issue within \"FortiProxy SSL VPN portal 2.0.0, 1.2.9 and below versions may allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access internal service such as the ZebOS Shell on the FortiProxy appliance through the Quick Connection functionality.\" Also, the CVE Reference Links Content Summary states that the root cause is \"**Improper access control** in the FortiProxy SSL VPN portal\".\n\nConsidering the available CWEs, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a more precise fit. It addresses the specific scenario where \"The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\" This aligns directly with the vulnerability, where the authorization mechanism **fails** to prevent an authenticated attacker from accessing internal services.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is based on:\n1.  The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **improper access control.**\n2.  The retriever results list CWE-863 as a candidate.\n3.  CWE-863 is a child of CWE-284, providing a more specific classification.\n4.  MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-284 and suggests considering its descendants.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
