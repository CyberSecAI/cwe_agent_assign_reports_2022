CWE-90 is a child of CWE-943 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic) which is a Class, while CWE-90 is a Base. The selection of CWE-90 is preferred because it is a more specific description of the vulnerability than its parent. CWE-74 is a high level class that contains many types of injection, making CWE-90 a more specific option.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe90[\"CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe90 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n    cwe90 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe90 primary\n    class cwe943,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty failing to neutralize special elements within an LDAP query, leading to an **LDAP injection** (**ROOT CAUSE**). This allows a remote authenticated attacker to send a specially crafted request, potentially granting unauthorized access to resources (**IMPACT**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to CWE-90 as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **LDAP injection**, and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this as the root cause. The Retriever Results also rank CWE-90 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-90 directly addresses the **weakness** of **improper neutralization** in LDAP queries. The description of CWE-90, \"The product constructs all or part of an LDAP query using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended LDAP query when it is sent to a downstream component,\" aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description.\n\nThe mapping guidance for CWE-90 recommends its use, stating that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\nCWE-74, while relevant as a general injection category, is less specific than CWE-90. The mapping guidance for CWE-74 discourages its use when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate. Given the explicit mention of **LDAP injection**, CWE-90 provides a more accurate and granular representation of the vulnerability.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence, relationship analysis, and mapping guidance, CWE-90 is the most appropriate classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an LDAP query using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended LDAP query when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-943\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
