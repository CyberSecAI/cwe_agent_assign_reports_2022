The secondary weakness is CWE-122, Heap-based Buffer Overflow, which is a **Variant** of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). CWE-190 can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which is a parent of CWE-787. Thus, the integer overflow leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n    class cwe787,cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **unchecked arithmetic** leading to an **integer overflow**, which results in a heap-based buffer overflow.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified an **integer overflow** vulnerability within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC library. The **root cause** is **unchecked arithmetic** leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description states: \"Multiple exploitable **integer overflow** vulnerabilities exist within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. A specially crafted MPEG-4 input in stts decoder can cause an **integer overflow** due to **unchecked arithmetic** resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides additional support: \"The root cause is an integer overflow during the parsing of an MPEG-4 container. Specifically, this overflow occurs in the `stts_box_read` function when processing an atom using the \"stts\" FOURCC code... This value is then multiplied by the size of the `GF_SttsEntry` structure which can lead to an integer overflow on 32-bit platforms, which results in a heap buffer with a smaller size being allocated.\" and \"Heap-based Buffer Overflow: When the library reads data into the undersized buffer, it writes outside the bounds of the allocated memory.\"\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-190, Integer Overflow or Wraparound, which accurately represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The secondary CWE is CWE-122, Heap-based Buffer Overflow, which describes the impact of the integer overflow. Both CWEs are at appropriate levels of specificity (Base and Variant, respectively).\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer - This is a Class-level CWE and is too general. The more specific CWE-122 and CWE-190 are more appropriate.\n*   CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') - While a buffer overflow occurs, it is a consequence of the integer overflow, making CWE-190 the more direct cause.\n*   CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read - Not applicable, as the vulnerability involves writing beyond the buffer boundary.\n*   CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error - While truncation could be involved, the primary issue is the overflow itself.\n*   CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input - This could be a contributing factor, but the integer overflow is the more direct **root cause**.",
