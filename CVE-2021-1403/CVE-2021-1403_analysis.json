CWE-1021 is related to UI redress attacks like clickjacking, and is a child of CWE-441, CWE-610, and CWE-451. CWE-400 is a class level CWE, and has several children like CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling). The relationships helped pinpoint the most specific and relevant CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1385[\"CWE-1385: Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets\"]\n    cwe1021[\"CWE-1021: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe346[\"CWE-346: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe441[\"CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary\"]\n    cwe610[\"CWE-610: Trust Boundary Violation\"]\n    cwe451[\"CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n    \n    cwe1385 -->|CHILDOF| cwe346\n    cwe1021 -->|CHILDOF| cwe441\n    cwe1021 -->|CHILDOF| cwe610\n    cwe1021 -->|CHILDOF| cwe451\n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1385 primary\n    class cwe1021,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient HTTP protections** (root cause), leading to a Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) attack. This allows an attacker to corrupt memory, causing a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the **insufficient HTTP protections** pointed towards a broad range of potential CWEs. However, the \"Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH)\" impact narrowed the focus significantly. The retriever results highlighted CWE-1385 (Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets) as a strong candidate, which aligns perfectly with the CSWSH attack vector.\n\nCWE-1385 is the most specific representation of the vulnerability as it directly addresses the **missing origin validation** in WebSockets that enables the attack. CWE-1021 is applicable since the attack involves tricking a user into interacting with a crafted link, potentially leading to UI redress issues. CWE-400 is relevant as the attack leads to a denial of service through resource exhaustion (memory corruption and device reload).\n\nThe selection of CWE-1385 as the primary CWE is based on its direct relevance to the **root cause** and the specific attack vector (CSWSH). The other CWEs are secondary, representing related aspects of the vulnerability's impact and potential exploitation techniques. The abstraction levels are appropriate, with CWE-1385 being a Variant and CWE-1021 being a Base.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description",
