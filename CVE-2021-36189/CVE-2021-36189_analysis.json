While CWE-311 is a broader class, the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the sensitive data being transmitted without encryption, making CWE-319 a relevant, though secondary, consideration. CWE-311 is a class level and has more specific children, so it is considered for the primary match.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe311 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing encryption of sensitive data** (CWE-311)\n2.  **Weakness:** Data transmitted in cleartext (CWE-319)\n3.  **Impact:** Information disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment points strongly to CWE-311 as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description's key phrase \"**missing encryption of sensitive data**\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary identifying the root cause as \"Missing encryption of sensitive data\". This is further confirmed by the Retriever Results, which lists CWE-311 as the top combined result.\n\nCWE-319 is also considered because the vulnerability description specifies that the information disclosure occurs via \"inspecting browser decrypted data\" which implies that the sensitive data was transmitted without encryption. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further emphasizes that \"sensitive information is not encrypted, leading to a data leak.\" However, since the **root cause** is the **missing encryption**, CWE-311 is determined to be the primary CWE, and CWE-319 is a secondary weakness due to the cleartext transmission aspect of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-311, while a class, directly addresses the core issue of missing encryption. CWE-319 adds further clarity by specifying the transmission aspect. A more general CWE would not capture the specific nature of this vulnerability, and a more specific CWE might not be applicable without further information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.83\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
