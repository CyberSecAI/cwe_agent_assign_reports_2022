## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), which is a class-level CWE. The retriever results suggested more specific child CWEs like CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). CWE-863 is a child of CWE-285, representing a more specific case where an authorization check is performed, but it's done incorrectly. The relationship between these CWEs indicates a hierarchical structure where improper authorization is the broader category, and incorrect authorization is a specific type of improper authorization.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper validation of the invited user's email address**. This leads to a failure in authorization, as users with email domains that should be blocked are added to projects. The final impact is the circumvention of access controls, potential data breaches, and compromised collaboration. The root cause is the **improper validation**, and the subsequent weakness is the resulting authorization bypass.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified **improper validation of email addresses** as the root cause, leading to projects adding members with email addresses from domains that should be blocked. The retriever results and complete CWE specifications were then analyzed to identify the most appropriate CWE.

The vulnerability description states "**Improper validation of invited users email address** in GitLab EE affecting all versions since 12.2 allowed projects to add members with email address domain that should be blocked by group settings". This aligns with the description of CWE-285 "The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports this with "The vulnerability arises from inconsistent application of domain restriction settings in GitLab. While the settings are correctly enforced at the group level, they are bypassed at the project level.". Since access restrictions are not consistently applied, users can access data or perform actions they should not be allowed to perform.

CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was also considered as a secondary CWE. It is a child of CWE-285 and represents a more specific case where an authorization check is performed, but it's done incorrectly. While the vulnerability description does point to an **improper validation**, the primary issue is that the authorization check is either missing or not properly enforcing domain restrictions, making CWE-285 a more suitable primary classification.

The selection of CWE-285 and CWE-863 is at the Class level of abstraction, as there isn't a specific Base or Variant level CWE that precisely captures the described weakness.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-22251

## Vulnerability Description
**Improper validation of invited users email address** in GitLab EE affecting all versions since 12.2 allowed projects to add members with email address domain that should be blocked by group settings

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Improper validation of invited users email address**
- **impact:** projects to add members with email address domain that should be blocked by group settings
- **product:** GitLab EE
- **version:** all versions since 12.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from inconsistent application of domain restriction settings in GitLab. While the settings are correctly enforced at the group level, they are bypassed at the project level. This means that users can be added to projects with email addresses that do not match the allowed domains configured at the group level.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inconsistent Access Control:** The core issue is the discrepancy in how access restrictions are applied at group and project levels. This inconsistency creates a bypass, weakening the intended security measures.
- **Lack of Enforcement at Project Level:** The domain restriction setting is not enforced when adding members directly to projects. This creates a loophole, allowing unauthorized users to gain access to projects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Circumvention of Access Controls:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to projects by adding members with email addresses from domains not permitted by the group settings.
- **Potential Data Breach:** Gaining access to projects may lead to the exposure of sensitive data or intellectual property contained within.
- **Compromised Collaboration:** Unauthorized users can be added to projects, disrupting workflows and introducing the risk of malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Project Membership Modification:** An attacker with maintainer privileges within a project could add unauthorized users directly to that project, bypassing the group-level domain restriction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Maintainer Role at Project Level:** To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have maintainer or higher privileges within a specific project.
- **Knowledge of Inconsistency:** The attacker must be aware of the inconsistent enforcement of domain restrictions between group and project levels.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was reported on HackerOne and assigned to gitlab_cmaxim.
- The vulnerability was discovered in 2019, but the provided text does not say when it was patched.
- The report explicitly mentions that this bug occurs on GitLab.com and likely on self-managed installations too.
- The documentation states that access should be restricted at all levels, but it was not being applied consistently, which is the root cause of the vulnerability.
- The report provides clear steps to reproduce the issue.

**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

### Extended Description


Attackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less effort than expected.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)




## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

### Extended Description


Attackers might be able to spoof the intended endpoint from a different system or process, thus gaining the same level of access as the intended endpoint.


While this issue frequently involves authentication between network-based clients and servers, other types of communication channels and endpoints can have this weakness.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry overlaps many other entries that are not organized around the kind of sensitive information that is exposed. However, because privacy is treated with such importance due to regulations and other factors, and it may be useful for weakness-finding tools to highlight capabilities that detect personal private information instead of system information, it is not clear whether - and how - this entry should be deprecated.

**[Other]** 

There are many types of sensitive information that products must protect from attackers, including system data, communications, configuration, business secrets, intellectual property, and an individual's personal (private) information. Private personal information may include a password, phone number, geographic location, personal messages, credit card number, etc. Private information is important to consider whether the person is a user of the product, or part of a data set that is processed by the product. An exposure of private information does not necessarily prevent the product from working properly, and in fact the exposure might be intended by the developer, e.g. as part of data sharing with other organizations. However, the exposure of personal private information can still be undesirable or explicitly prohibited by law or regulation.


Some types of private information include:


  - Government identifiers, such as Social Security Numbers

  - Contact information, such as home addresses and telephone numbers

  - Geographic location - where the user is (or was)

  - Employment history

  - Financial data - such as credit card numbers, salary, bank accounts, and debts

  - Pictures, video, or audio

  - Behavioral patterns - such as web surfing history, when certain activities are performed, etc.

  - Relationships (and types of relationships) with others - family, friends, contacts, etc.

  - Communications - e-mail addresses, private messages, text messages, chat logs, etc.

  - Health - medical conditions, insurance status, prescription records

  - Account passwords and other credentials

Some of this information may be characterized as PII (Personally Identifiable Information), Protected Health Information (PHI), etc. Categories of private information may overlap or vary based on the intended usage or the policies and practices of a particular industry.

Sometimes data that is not labeled as private can have a privacy implication in a different context. For example, student identification numbers are usually not considered private because there is no explicit and publicly-available mapping to an individual student's personal information. However, if a school generates identification numbers based on student social security numbers, then the identification numbers should be considered private.







## CWE-350: Reliance on Reverse DNS Resolution for a Security-Critical Action
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product performs reverse DNS resolution on an IP address to obtain the hostname and make a security decision, but it does not properly ensure that the IP address is truly associated with the hostname.

### Extended Description


Since DNS names can be easily spoofed or misreported, and it may be difficult for the product to detect if a trusted DNS server has been compromised, DNS names do not constitute a valid authentication mechanism.


When the product performs a reverse DNS resolution for an IP address, if an attacker controls the DNS server for that IP address, then the attacker can cause the server to return an arbitrary hostname. As a result, the attacker may be able to bypass authentication, cause the wrong hostname to be recorded in log files to hide activities, or perform other attacks.


Attackers can spoof DNS names by either (1) compromising a DNS server and modifying its records (sometimes called DNS cache poisoning), or (2) having legitimate control over a DNS server associated with their IP address.


### Alternative Terms

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** CWE-350, CWE-247, and CWE-292 were merged into CWE-350 in CWE 2.5. CWE-247 was originally derived from Seven Pernicious Kingdoms, CWE-350 from PLOVER, and CWE-292 from CLASP. All taxonomies focused closely on the use of reverse DNS for authentication of incoming requests.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-1488:** Does not do double-reverse lookup to prevent DNS spoofing.
- **CVE-2001-1500:** Does not verify reverse-resolved hostnames in DNS.
- **CVE-2000-1221:** Authentication bypass using spoofed reverse-resolved DNS hostnames.




## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

### Extended Description


Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.


For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.


One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.


### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-36539:** An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.




## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.

### Extended Description
Some regular expression engines have a feature called "backtracking". If the token cannot match, the engine "backtracks" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.
 Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:


  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.

  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.

  - The input can be long enough.

 Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. 

### Alternative Terms
ReDoS: ReDoS is an abbreviation of "Regular expression Denial of Service".
Regular Expression Denial of Service: While this term is attack-focused, this is commonly used to describe the weakness.
Catastrophic backtracking: This term is used to describe the behavior of the regular expression as a negative technical impact.
