This vulnerability involves dereferencing a pointer that originates from an untrusted source without proper validation. The hierarchical relationship shows that CWE-822 is a child of CWE-119 (**CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**), indicating that it is a specific type of buffer operation error. CWE-822 can precede CWE-125 (**CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read**) and CWE-787 (**CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write**), implying that an untrusted pointer dereference can lead to out-of-bounds memory access. The secondary CWE is CWE-200 (**CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**), since the **impact** is a kernel address leak.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe822[\"CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe822 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe822 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n    cwe822 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe822 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe125,cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of input validation** of a pointer used by an eBPF filter. This leads to **untrusted pointer dereference**, where the kernel accesses memory locations using the unvalidated pointer. The final impact is **information disclosure**, as internal kernel memory addresses are leaked.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference)** because the vulnerability stems from the kernel dereferencing a pointer from an untrusted source (eBPF filter) without sufficient validation. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-822. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions \"untrusted pointer dereference\" as a core weakness. The retriever results also list CWE-822 as the top candidate. The abstraction level of Base is optimal as it directly represents the specific error.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a secondary consideration because the **impact** of the vulnerability is that it leaks kernel internal addresses, which constitutes sensitive information. However, CWE-200 is discouraged as a primary mapping because it represents the impact rather than the root cause. The root cause is the improper handling and dereferencing of the untrusted pointer (CWE-822), which then leads to the information leak.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
