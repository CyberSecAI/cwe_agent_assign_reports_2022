CWE-312, Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information, is also related, being a parent of CWE-256. The abstraction levels influenced the choice of CWE-256 as the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe312,cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows: the **root cause** is the **API key stored unencrypted** in the job config.xml files. This leads to the vulnerability where users with Extended Read permission or access to the master file system can view the API key. Thus, the chain is: **Improper Storage -> Information Disclosure.**\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the most specific CWE that captures the essence of storing a password in plaintext. The Retriever Results and Complete CWE Specifications were crucial in refining this selection.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states that the \"API key\" was \"stored unencrypted in job config.xml files\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this stating, \"Sensitive information (NuGet API key) is stored in plain text instead of being encrypted.\"\n\nCWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) directly matches this description. It is a Base level CWE, which is preferred. The mapping guidance for CWE-256 ALLOWED and states \"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\"\n\nCWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) was considered but deemed less specific, as it covers all sensitive information, not specifically passwords. CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a Class-level CWE, and its description is more general than CWE-256. The mapping guidance for CWE-522 is Allowed-with-Review and states, \"This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\".\n\nTherefore, CWE-256 is the most appropriate and specific CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nStoring a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
