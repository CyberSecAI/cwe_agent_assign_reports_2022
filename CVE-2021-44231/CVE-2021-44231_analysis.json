While CWE-74 is a broader \"Injection\" class, CWE-94 specifically addresses the **improper control of code generation**, which aligns more precisely with the vulnerability description stating that an attacker can \"inject code that can be executed by the application.\" CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) is another child of CWE-94, but the description does not specify use of a template engine.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    \n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n    class cwe1336 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the application's use of text extraction reports which are then used to generate code, followed by the **improper control of that code generation**, leading to arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-94 due to the explicit mention of code injection and execution in the vulnerability description. The key phrase \"inject code that can be executed by the application\" directly aligns with CWE-94's description: \"The product constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.\"\n\nThe Retriever Results also support this selection, with CWE-94 being the top-ranked CWE. While CWE-74 is also a relevant candidate, it is a broader class of injection vulnerabilities, whereas CWE-94 is more specific to code injection.\n\nThe MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-94 advises \"Allowed-with-Review\" and notes that it is \"frequently misused for vulnerabilities with a technical impact of 'code execution,' which does not by itself indicate a root cause weakness.\" However, in this case, the vulnerability description explicitly states that the attacker can \"inject code,\" making CWE-94 a suitable fit, since the product's functionality intentionally constructs all or part of a code segment.\n\nI am confident in selecting CWE-94 as the primary CWE because the evidence provided directly supports this classification.\nThe selection of CWE-94 is also at the optimal level of specificity, as it accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability without being overly broad or narrow. The description provides sufficient details to distinguish it from other injection vulnerabilities.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere.
