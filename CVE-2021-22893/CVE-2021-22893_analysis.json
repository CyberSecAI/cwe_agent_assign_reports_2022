CWE-288 is related to CWE-306 via a ChildOf relationship, indicating that **Authentication Bypass** often stems from missing authentication for critical functions. While **remote code execution** is part of the description, the root cause is the **authentication bypass**, and code execution is the result of the bypass. Therefore, focusing on the authentication issues provides a more accurate reflection of the vulnerability's origin.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe306\n    cwe94\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe288 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe94 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **authentication bypass** (CWE-288), potentially due to **missing authentication** on a critical function (CWE-306), which leads to **remote code execution** (potentially facilitated by CWE-94).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **authentication bypass** as the primary weakness, leading to the selection of CWE-288. The supporting evidence includes the vulnerability description stating an **authentication bypass** and the CVE reference links confirming that an unauthenticated user can perform **remote code execution**.\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-288 with a high score. While code execution is an impact, the root cause is the **authentication bypass**. CWE-94, related to **code injection**, was considered but deemed secondary since the primary issue is circumventing authentication. CWE-306 was considered because it is a ChildOf CWE-288.\n\nThe final decision prioritizes CWE-288 as the primary weakness because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions an **authentication bypass**, and the CVE details confirm that this bypass leads to **remote code execution**. CWE-306 is considered a secondary candidate because it is a prerequisite that allows the bypass to happen. CWE-94, although potentially involved in the **code execution** phase, is less directly tied to the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization\n\t\t\tVector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are\n\t\t\tsufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected\n\t\t\tcryptographic requirements for that primitive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
