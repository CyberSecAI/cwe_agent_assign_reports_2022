While it is a discouraged mapping, there is not enough information provided to determine the root cause to select a more specific base-level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe1390 -->|Suggested Alternative| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|Suggested Alternative| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n    class cwe1390,cwe306 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability involves an MFA bypass due to manipulation of the `wordpress_logged_in_[hash]` cookie. This indicates a flaw in the authentication process, where the **WEAKNESS** lies in how the application verifies user identity.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description states that WP Cerber before 8.9.3 allows MFA bypass via `wordpress_logged_in_[hash]` manipulation. The retriever results pointed towards several CWEs, but based on the available information, the most appropriate CWE is CWE-287 Improper Authentication.\n*   The vulnerability description states: MFA bypass via `wordpress_logged_in_[hash]` manipulation. This indicates a **ROOTCAUSE** in the authentication mechanism.\n*   CWE-287's description states: \"When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\"\n*   The manipulation of the `wordpress_logged_in_[hash]` cookie suggests that the application is not adequately validating the user's session or authentication status.\n*   CWE-287 is a class-level CWE, and the mapping guidance discourages its use when lower-level CWEs are applicable. However, the current description does not provide sufficient information to pinpoint the specific **ROOTCAUSE** of the **WEAKNESS** to choose between CWE-1390 Weak Authentication, or CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function.\n*   The evidence and confidence is medium because there is no CVE Reference Links Content Summary section.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:",
