# Analysis for CVE-2021-21955

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-331 | Insufficient Entropy | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.8 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |
| CWE-288 | Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the chain involving **insufficient entropy** leading to a weaker key. This enabled the **authentication bypass** due to the predictability of the key and ultimately allowed for the **recovery of the password**. Additionally, the cleartext transmission of the serial number facilitated the exploit.
The selection of CWE-331 as the primary weakness stems from its direct relation to the root cause, which is the reduction of entropy in the AES key generation process. CWE-319 is included as a secondary weakness because the transmission of the device's serial number in cleartext enabled the exploitation of the primary weakness. CWE-288 is included as a secondary weakness because the attacker was able to bypass the authentication mechanism by sniffing network traffic.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-331 (Insufficient Entropy)**, which leads to a weakened encryption key. The cleartext transmission of the serial number, represented by **CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information)**, provides necessary information to exploit the **weak** key. This, in turn, leads to **CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel)**, allowing an attacker to recover the password.
- Root Cause: **CWE-331 (Insufficient Entropy)**
- Contributing Factor: **CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information)**
- Exploitation: **CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel)**
- Impact: Password Recovery

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the detailed vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary.
The evidence strongly suggests that the root cause is the **insufficient entropy** in the key generation process, which is compounded by the cleartext transmission of the serial number. This leads to an **authentication bypass** and the ability to recover the password.

The graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the chain of events, starting from the root cause (**insufficient entropy**) and leading to the final impact (**authentication bypass** and password recovery). The selection of CWE-331 is further supported by the CVE reference links content summary, which explicitly mentions the reduction of entropy in the AES key.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the technical details of the vulnerability. CWE-331 directly addresses the **root cause** of the **weakened key**, while CWE-319 captures the contributing factor of the cleartext transmission of the serial number. CWE-288 is relevant because it describes the end result of the attack sequence.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-21955

## Vulnerability Description
An **authentication bypass** vulnerability exists in the get_aes_key_info_by_packetid() function of the home_security binary of Anker Eufy Homebase 2 2.1.6.9h. Generic network sniffing can lead to password recovery. An attacker can sniff network traffic to trigger this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **authentication bypass**
- **impact:** password recovery
- **vector:** network sniffing
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Anker Eufy Homebase 2
- **version:** 2.1.6.9h
- **component:** get_aes_key_info_by_packetid() function of home_security binary

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the way the Anker Eufy Homebase 2 generates and uses the AES encryption key for authenticating cloud communication. Specifically, the `get_aes_key_info_by_packetid()` function reduces the entropy of the AES key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Predictable Key Generation:** While the initial AES key (`s_aes_key`) is randomly generated on boot, the `get_aes_key_info_by_packetid()` function modifies it by overwriting the last 10 bytes with the decimal representation of the packet's timestamp.
2.  **Insufficient Key Space:** This overwrite reduces the effective key space from 16 random bytes to only the first 6 bytes of the random key, as the last 10 bytes are based on the timestamp. The key space becomes 64^6 instead of 64^16 making brute-forcing possible.
3.  **Unencrypted Serial Number Transmission:** The device's serial number (`hub_sn`) is transmitted in cleartext over the network within unauthenticated packets, allowing an attacker to obtain the required plaintext for the authentication process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism used for cloud communication. With this access, the attacker can execute authenticated commands, some of which are powerful and could lead to further compromise of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** The attacker needs to be able to sniff network traffic between the Eufy Homebase 2 and the cloud server.
*   **Brute Force:** The attacker can then use a brute-force attack offline to deduce the first 6 bytes of the AES key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Position:** The attacker needs to be positioned within the network to intercept traffic between the Eufy Homebase 2 and the cloud server.
*   **Network Sniffing Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have the ability to capture and analyze network packets.
*   **Computational Resources:** The attacker needs the computational resources to perform the offline brute-force attack of the reduced key space.

In summary, the vulnerability exists due to the use of a weak key derivation function, along with the transmission of a sensitive value in the clear, that ultimately allowed an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and execute privileged actions.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses an algorithm or scheme that produces insufficient entropy, leaving patterns or clusters of values that are more likely to occur than others.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-330
ChildOf -> CWE-330

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-0950:** Insufficiently random data used to generate session tokens using C rand(). Also, for certificate/key generation, uses a source that does not block when entropy is low.
- **CVE-2008-2108:** Chain: insufficient precision (CWE-1339) in random-number generator causes some zero bits to be reliably generated, reducing the amount of entropy (CWE-331)




## CWE-300: Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not adequately verify the identity of actors at both ends of a communication channel, or does not adequately ensure the integrity of the channel, in a way that allows the channel to be accessed or influenced by an actor that is not an endpoint.

### Extended Description
In order to establish secure communication between two parties, it is often important to adequately verify the identity of entities at each end of the communication channel. Inadequate or inconsistent verification may result in insufficient or incorrect identification of either communicating entity. This can have negative consequences such as misplaced trust in the entity at the other end of the channel. An attacker can leverage this by interposing between the communicating entities and masquerading as the original entity. In the absence of sufficient verification of identity, such an attacker can eavesdrop and potentially modify the communication between the original entities.

- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.
- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.




## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.

### Extended Description


A hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:

```
		Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.
		Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.
```
In the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.

The Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry could be split into multiple variants: an inbound variant (as seen in the second demonstrative example) and an outbound variant (as seen in the first demonstrative example). These variants are likely to have different consequences, detectability, etc. More importantly, from a vulnerability theory perspective, they could be characterized as different behaviors.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** overlaps Unprotected Alternate Channel



### Observed Examples

- **CVE-1999-1454:** Attackers with physical access to the machine may bypass the password prompt by pressing the ESC (Escape) key.
- **CVE-1999-1077:** OS allows local attackers to bypass the password protection of idled sessions via the programmer's switch or CMD-PWR keyboard sequence, which brings up a debugger that the attacker can use to disable the lock.




## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

### Extended Description


If a web product does not properly protect assumed-immutable values from modification in hidden form fields, parameters, cookies, or URLs, this can lead to modification of critical data. Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.


For example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.

## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read




## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29519:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends sensitive information in plaintext, including passwords and session tokens.
- **CVE-2022-30312:** Building Controller uses a protocol that transmits authentication credentials in plaintext.
- **CVE-2022-31204:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends password in plaintext.




## CWE-291: Reliance on IP Address for Authentication
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an IP address for authentication.

### Extended Description
IP addresses can be easily spoofed. Attackers can forge the source IP address of the packets they send, but response packets will return to the forged IP address. To see the response packets, the attacker has to sniff the traffic between the victim machine and the forged IP address. In order to accomplish the required sniffing, attackers typically attempt to locate themselves on the same subnet as the victim machine. Attackers may be able to circumvent this requirement by using source routing, but source routing is disabled across much of the Internet today. In summary, IP address verification can be a useful part of an authentication scheme, but it should not be the single factor required for authentication.
