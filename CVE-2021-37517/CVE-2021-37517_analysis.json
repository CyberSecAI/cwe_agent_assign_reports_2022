It is a child of CWE-285 **Improper Authorization** and CWE-284 **Improper Access Control**. CWE-799 **Improper Control of Interaction Frequency** is a class level weakness and is related to denial of service.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe799[\"CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper authorization check**, which allows an attacker to potentially cause a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description pointed towards a Denial of Service caused by the application allowing email addresses as usernames in the forgot-password function. However, the CVE reference links content summary indicates that the root cause is an **\"Improper Authorization Check\"**, specifically in the user account management functionality. The commit diffs show changes related to password setting and input sanitization for login names, supporting the **improper authorization** claim.\n\nThe initial analysis was based on the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\", which mentioned \"Denial of Service\" as the impact. However, the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" provided more detailed information about the root cause.\n\nThe graph relationships helped clarify the relationship between **Improper Authorization** and its potential consequences. While Denial of Service is a possible outcome, the root cause lies in the **incorrect authorization check**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-863 directly addresses the **incorrect authorization**, and CWE-799 relates to the Denial of Service. The evidence supports these classifications, as the commit message and code changes indicate an **improper authorization check** was the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context
