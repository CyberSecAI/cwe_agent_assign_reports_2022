The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**improper access control**\", making it a relevant starting point. However, the MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-284 due to its high-level nature and suggests using more specific descendants. The secondary CWE candidate is CWE-200, which describes exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor. This is related to the impact described in the vulnerability, but is not a root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe200 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control** (CWE-284) which leads to the exposure of configuration information (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **improper access control** as the primary weakness based on the vulnerability description and key phrases. The CVE reference links content summary confirms this by stating that the root cause is an \"Improper access control within the web console.\" However, due to the high-level nature of CWE-284, the MITRE mapping guidance suggests considering more specific descendants. After further review, no more specific CWEs could be derived from the evidence. CWE-200, \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor,\" was considered as a secondary weakness due to the information disclosure impact, but it is a technical impact not a root cause error.\n\nThe assessment is based on the provided evidence which explicitly mentions \"**improper access control**\". The graph relationships indicate that CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, and more specific CWEs are preferred. However, in this case, the available information is not detailed enough to map to a more specific CWE.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the available evidence. While CWE-284 is high-level, it accurately reflects the **improper access control** issue described in the vulnerability.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
