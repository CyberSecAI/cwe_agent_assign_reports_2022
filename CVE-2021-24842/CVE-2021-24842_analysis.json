It is related to CWE-285 [CWE-285: Improper Authorization] and CWE-284 by a ChildOf relationship. CWE-862 is a more specific case of authorization failure than CWE-285. The secondary CWE, CWE-200 [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information], is related by a peer relationship, indicating it's a closely related but distinct weakness. This relationship analysis helps to narrow down the selection to the most accurate CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    cwe200 -->|PeerOf| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing capability checks** (CWE-862). The impact of this **missing** check is that users with Contributor roles can list private post titles and change the posted date of other users' posts (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **missing capability checks** as the root cause. The provided evidence supports this assessment.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that there are **missing capability checks**, allowing unauthorized actions. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also highlights the lack of proper authorization checks as the root cause, explicitly mentioning broken access control and insufficient authorization. \"The plugin does not enforce capability checks, allowing users with the 'Contributor' role (which typically has limited privileges) to perform actions they should not be able to.\"\n\nThe retriever results and relationship analysis further solidified the choice of CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] as the primary CWE. The secondary CWE, CWE-200 [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information], addresses the impact of the **missing authorization**, where sensitive post titles are exposed.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause (CWE-862) and the direct impact (CWE-200) of the vulnerability, based on the provided evidence and relationship context.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
