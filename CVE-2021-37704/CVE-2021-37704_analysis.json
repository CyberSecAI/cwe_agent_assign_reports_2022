The vulnerability also has potential for CWE-200 because it can lead to exposure of sensitive information. The potential for path traversal (CWE-22) exists if the `/vendor` directory is accessible and mishandled, but it is not the primary issue. CWE-552 is a base-level CWE, which is the preferred abstraction level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe552[\"CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    \n    cwe552 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe22 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe552 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe22 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain begins with the inclusion of a `phpinfo.php` file in the library's documentation examples. If the `/vendor` directory is not properly secured, this file becomes accessible, leading to information disclosure.\n  - Inclusion of `phpinfo.php` (root cause) -> **CWE-552** (Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties) -> CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **CWE-552 (Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties)** because the core issue is that the `/vendor` directory, containing a `phpinfo.php` file, is not protected from public access. This aligns directly with CWE-552's description: \"The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\"\n\nThe supporting evidence comes from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\": \"The vulnerability is due to the presence of a `phpinfo.php` file within the `/docs/examples` directory of the `phpfastcache` library. If the `/vendor` directory containing this file is not protected from public access, it can be exploited to reveal sensitive server information.\"\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a potential secondary weakness, as the exposed `phpinfo()` output contains sensitive server details. However, CWE-200 is discouraged by MITRE when a more specific root cause is identifiable.\n\nCWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')) is a tertiary concern. While path traversal *could* be a factor if the `/vendor` directory's access controls are misconfigured, the primary issue is the lack of protection in the first place, making CWE-552 the more direct and appropriate classification.\n\nCWE-552 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level. It accurately represents the vulnerability because it directly addresses the **weakness** of having files accessible when they should not be.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
