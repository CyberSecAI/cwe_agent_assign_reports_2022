CWE-522 is a Class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password). The relationship analysis indicates that the vulnerability involves transmitting sensitive information in cleartext, which directly relates to CWE-319. The weakness also involves insufficiently protected credentials, as highlighted by CWE-522, because the password should not be transmitted in cleartext.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    \n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n    class cwe256 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **reflection of the user password during the login process** when **redirecting the user from a HTTPS endpoint to a HTTP endpoint.** This leads to **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319)**, which is a form of **Insufficiently Protected Credentials (CWE-522)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered the vulnerability description and the retriever results. The description indicates that the password is being reflected after redirecting from HTTPS to HTTP, which clearly points to **CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information)**. The retriever results also highlight **CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials)** as a possible match, which is a valid secondary consideration.\n\nThe decision is strongly based on the provided evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\":\n- \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Ypsomed mylife Cloud reflects the user password during the login process after redirecting the user from an HTTPS endpoint to an HTTP endpoint.\"\n- \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficiently protected credentials (CWE-522). The password is leaked by transitioning from a secure HTTPS connection to an insecure HTTP connection.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by confirming the direct connection between the cleartext transmission and the insufficiently protected credentials.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because **CWE-319** directly describes the **cleartext transmission**, while **CWE-522** acknowledges the **insufficient protection of the password**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
