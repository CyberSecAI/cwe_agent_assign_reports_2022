While I would prefer a Base or Variant level CWE, the information provided does not provide enough detail to determine the specific authentication failure. Authorization, CWE-285, is a weakness that can result from authentication bypass.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe285 -->|CANRESULTIN| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **improper authentication** (CWE-287) of sub-frames within a multicast AMSDU frame. This **improper authentication** leads to the **impact** of information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-287, Improper Authentication, as the primary weakness. The provided vulnerability description states \"**Improper authentication of sub-frames of a multicast AMSDU frame** can lead to information disclosure\".\n\nThe description points to a problem in the authentication process for sub-frames within a multicast AMSDU frame. The **improper authentication** is the root cause. This **improper authentication** can lead to information disclosure, highlighting a potential impact of the weakness. Since authentication occurs before authorization, the **improper authentication** could bypass authorization controls. This could lead to unauthorized access to resources or data, resulting in information disclosure.\n\nCWE-287 is at the Class level of abstraction. More information would be needed to select a more specific Base or Variant level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction
