CWE-312 [Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information] is a child of CWE-311 [Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data] and CWE-922 [Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information]. Because the vulnerability involves storing credentials in cleartext, CWE-312 is a more specific and appropriate choice than its parents. CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] is included because the unprotected directory lacks authentication, which is a separate but related weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe922[\"CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe922\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **cleartext storage** of administrative login credentials in an XML file. This leads to **inadequate access control** because the directory is unprotected. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to access the file and leads to **authentication bypass**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\". The **weakness** is described as \"**clear-text credentials disclosure**\", and the root cause is the system storing administrative login credentials in **cleartext** within an XML file located in an unprotected directory. This directly supports the selection of CWE-312 [Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information] as the primary CWE. The lack of protection on the directory is a separate weakness.\n\nThe retriever results also support the choice of CWE-312 [Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information], as well as other related CWEs like CWE-256 [Plaintext Storage of a Password]. However, CWE-312 [Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information] is more encompassing as it refers to sensitive information in general, not just passwords.\n\nThe selection of CWE-312 [Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information] is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the storage of sensitive information in **cleartext**. The CWE's description matches the vulnerability details: \"The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\"\n\nCWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] is a secondary weakness because the unprotected directory allows unauthorized access to the **cleartext credentials**. This missing authentication is critical for protecting the sensitive XML file.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n### Considered but not used:\nCWE-256 [Plaintext Storage of a Password]: Considered but not used because the vulnerability involves more than just passwords being stored in cleartext. The XML file could contain other sensitive information as well.\nCWE-319 [Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information]: Considered but not used because the vulnerability is about storage, not transmission.\nCWE-798 [Use of Hard-coded Credentials]: Considered but not used because the vulnerability is about exposure of existing credentials in **cleartext**, not the use of hard-coded credentials in the code.\nCWE-522 [Insufficiently Protected Credentials]: Considered but not used because it is a class level CWE, and CWE-312 [Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information] is a more specific base level CWE.",
