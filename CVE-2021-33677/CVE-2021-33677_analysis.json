This aligns with the description of CWE-749, which states that \"The product provides an Applications Programming Interface (API) or similar interface for interaction with external actors, but the interface includes a dangerous method or function that is not properly restricted.\"\n\nThe vulnerability description highlights the **WEAKNESS** being that functions are exposed externally, which is the root cause, whereas \"information disclosure\" is a consequence of that **WEAKNESS**.\n\nThe retriever also listed CWE-200, but the description specifically states \"The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information\" which is not directly the root cause of the vulnerability, so it is not a great fit. It also has a \"Discouraged\" usage.\n\nCWE-749 is at the Base level of abstraction and has an Allowed usage. The evidence directly supports the mapping since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions exposed functions leading to information disclosure.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.113\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides an Applications Programming Interface (API) or similar interface for interaction with external actors, but the interface includes a dangerous method or function that is not properly restricted.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **impact:** information disclosure\n- **product:** SAP NetWeaver ABAP Server and ABAP Platform\n- **version:** 700 and 702 and 730 and 731 and 804 and 740 and 750 and 784\n- **component:** external functions",
