CWE-1321 (Prototype Pollution) is also related as it can involve the modification of object attributes during deserialization. While CWE-79 is a potential impact, the root cause lies in the insecure deserialization, making CWE-502 the primary weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe1321[\"CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\"]\n    \n    cwe79 <--|IMPACT| cwe502\n    cwe1321 <--|CANPRECEDE| cwe502\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe502 primary\n    class cwe79,cwe1321 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **deserialization of untrusted data** (CWE-502), which allows for the injection of malicious code. This injected code is then executed in the browser, leading to **cross-site scripting** (CWE-79). Prototype pollution (CWE-1321) can be a technique used during the deserialization process to achieve code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-502 as the primary weakness due to the insecure deserialization of JavaScript objects. The CVE reference links explicitly mention CWE-502 as the relevant CWE. The retriever results also list CWE-502 as the top candidate.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that the affected core relates to **JavaScript object creation when parsing json input**. This is directly related to deserialization of untrusted data, as the input is being parsed and used to create JavaScript objects. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating the **Root Cause of Vulnerability** as \"Deserialization of Untrusted Data: The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of arbitrary JavaScript objects within the `Ajax.NET-Professional` library. The `parse` function uses `eval` on user-provided data after applying some regex replacements.\" This provides strong evidence for CWE-502.\n\nCWE-79 (Cross-Site Scripting) is a secondary effect, as the deserialized data can contain malicious scripts that are then executed in the browser. The CVE reference links mentions **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** as a weakness and that the vulnerability allows for the injection of malicious scripts into a website.\n\nCWE-1321 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')) is also a potential secondary issue. The vulnerability involves **JavaScript object creation when parsing json input**. Prototype pollution is a technique that can be used when creating javascript objects.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-502 being the root cause and CWE-79 and CWE-1321 being potential impacts or techniques used in the exploitation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n- CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n- CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')",
