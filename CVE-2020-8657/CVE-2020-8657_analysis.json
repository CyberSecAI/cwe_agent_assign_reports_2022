CWE-321 **Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key** and CWE-1394 **Use of Default Cryptographic Key** are both related to CWE-798. CWE-321 is a Variant of CWE-798, representing a more specific case where the hardcoded credential is a cryptographic key. CWE-1394 is a Base level CWE and a child of CWE-1392. The relationship between CWE-798 and CWE-321 influenced the decision to include CWE-321 as a secondary candidate, as the vulnerability involves a hardcoded API key, which can be considered a cryptographic key.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe1394[\"CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe1394 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1392\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1392\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe798 primary\n    class cwe321,cwe1394 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a hard-coded API key**. This leads to a predictable access token, which then allows an attacker to calculate or guess the admin access token and gain unauthorized access.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-798 **Use of Hard-coded Credentials**\n  - **Weakness:** Predictable access token generation\n  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access and control of the system\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly indicate that the use of a **hardcoded API key** is the primary issue.\n\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The vulnerability stems from the **use of a hardcoded, default API key** (`\u20acOn@piK3Y`) in EON (EyesOfNetwork) version 5.3.\"\n\nThe graph relationships, particularly the child-of relationship between CWE-321 and CWE-798 and the fact that API keys are used for cryptographic purposes, influenced the decision to include CWE-321 as a secondary candidate. Similarly, the observation that the key is a default key led to the consideration of CWE-1394 **Use of Default Cryptographic Key**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-798 directly addresses the core issue of using hardcoded credentials. While CWE-321 is more specific (hardcoded cryptographic key), it's included as a secondary candidate because the API key has cryptographic implications. The primary CWE is CWE-798 because it captures the general weakness, and CWE-321 provides additional context.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a default cryptographic key for potentially critical functionality.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1393: Use of Default Password\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses default passwords for potentially critical functionality.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
