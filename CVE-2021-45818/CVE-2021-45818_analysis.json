CWE-113 focuses on the specific case of CRLF injection in HTTP headers, leading to HTTP response splitting. The parent CWE, CWE-93, is a more general case of CRLF injection. CWE-113 can precede CWE-79 (Cross-Site Scripting), indicating a potential exploitation path.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    cwe113 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe113 primary\n    class cwe93,cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **CRLF injection** (**weakness**) which directly leads to HTTP response splitting (**impact**). The product, SAFARI Montage 8.7.32, **fails to neutralize CRLF sequences**, allowing an attacker to manipulate HTTP headers and potentially inject malicious content.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that SAFARI Montage 8.7.32 is affected by a **CRLF injection** vulnerability, which can lead to HTTP response splitting. The key phrase \"CRLF injection\" directly points to weaknesses related to improper handling of CRLF sequences.\n\nThe Retriever Results list CWE-113, \"Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\", as the top candidate. This CWE accurately describes the vulnerability, where the **failure to neutralize CRLF sequences in HTTP headers** leads to HTTP response splitting. CWE-113 is a Variant, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The \"Usage\" is \"Allowed\".\nThe description of CWE-113, \"The product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers,\" aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description.\n\nTherefore, CWE-113 is the most appropriate mapping.\n\nCWE-93, \"Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\", is a more general case of CRLF injection. While it's related, CWE-113 is more specific to the context of HTTP headers and response splitting.\n\nCWE-444, \"Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')\", is related to HTTP request/response handling, but it's about inconsistencies in how intermediaries interpret messages, not directly about CRLF injection.\n\nCWE-79, \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\", is a potential consequence of HTTP response splitting, but it's not the root cause. An attacker might use HTTP response splitting to inject XSS payloads, but the initial weakness is the CRLF injection.\n\nCWE-117, \"Improper Output Neutralization for Logs\", relates to logging and is not the primary issue described.\n\nTherefore, I am confident that CWE-113 is the best choice.",
