This CWE is a base level weakness and is a child of **CWE-943 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic)**. The description explicitly mentions \"LDAP injection\", making CWE-90 the most appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe90[\"CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\"]\n    \n    cwe90 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe90 primary\n    class cwe943 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the following:\n  1.  The application fails to sanitize the `userLogin` parameter.\n  2.  An attacker crafts a malicious POST request to inject LDAP special elements.\n  3.  The injected elements modify the LDAP query, leading to sensitive information disclosure.\n  - The root cause is the **unsanitized userLogin parameter**.\n  - The weakness is the resulting **LDAP injection**.\n  - The impact is obtaining sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards **CWE-90 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection'))** due to the explicit mention of \"LDAP injection\" in the vulnerability description.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"The userLogin parameter in ldap/login.php of rConfig 3.9.5 is **unsanitized**, allowing attackers to perform a **LDAP injection** and obtain sensitive information via a crafted POST request.\"\n\nThis statement provides direct evidence that the application does not properly neutralize special elements in the LDAP query, which aligns perfectly with the description of **CWE-90 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection'))**.\n\nThe retriever results also listed **CWE-90 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection'))** as the top combined result, further reinforcing this decision.\n\nThe other CWEs were considered but ultimately not chosen because they were either too general (e.g., **CWE-138 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements)** or **CWE-790 (Improper Filtering of Special Elements)**, or they pertained to different types of injection (e.g., **CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'))**, **CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'))**, **CWE-917 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection'))**).\n\nThe selection of **CWE-90 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection'))** is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the type of injection described in the vulnerability.",
