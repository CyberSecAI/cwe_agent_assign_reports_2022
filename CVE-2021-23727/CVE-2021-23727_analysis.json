The description explicitly mentions \"**command injection** vulnerability\" and that the product \"**trusts the messages and metadata stored in backends**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further clarifies that the **root cause** is that \"Celery task queue deserializes data from the backend (result stores) without proper sanitization\" which can lead to \"**Stored Command Injection (CWE-78)**\".\n\nBased on this evidence, **CWE-78** is selected as the primary CWE because the core issue is that the application interprets data as commands, allowing arbitrary command execution. **CWE-502** is chosen as a secondary CWE because the **root cause** is the **deserialization of untrusted data** without proper validation.\n\nThe retriever results also support these findings, with **CWE-78** and **CWE-502** being highly ranked. The hierarchical relationships confirm that **CWE-78** is a specific type of command injection, making it more appropriate than the more general **CWE-77**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
