Several related CWEs were considered, including CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) and CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash). CWE-327 is a peer of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data), while CWE-328 is a child of both CWE-326 and CWE-327. The relationship analysis indicates that while CWE-326 is a good starting point, the specific algorithm used and its weaknesses should be considered.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    \n    cwe326 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe327 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe328 -->|CHILDOF| cwe326\n    cwe328 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe327 -->|PEEROF| cwe311\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe326 primary\n    class cwe327,cwe328,cwe311 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a weak encryption algorithm** for sensitive data storage. This leads to the potential **compromise of credentials**, ultimately resulting in unauthorized access to the system. The root cause is the **inadequate encryption**, and the impact is credential compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **use of a weak encryption algorithm** as the primary issue. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions **Inadequate Encryption Strength (CWE-326)** as the primary weakness.\nThe retriever results also suggest CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) and CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash).\nThe final decision is based on the evidence provided, which strongly points to **CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength)** as the most appropriate primary classification. CWE-327 and CWE-328 are secondary possibilities, depending on the specifics of the encryption algorithm used.\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, accurately representing the weakness described in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts within a short time frame.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm or scheme that produces insufficient entropy, leaving patterns or clusters of values that are more likely to occur than others.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
