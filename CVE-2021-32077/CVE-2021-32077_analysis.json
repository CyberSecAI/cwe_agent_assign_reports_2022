CWE-202 is in a peer relationship with CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information), and CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data). CWE-202 is a child of CWE-1230 (Improper handling of sensitive data). The secondary candidate, CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), is a Base level CWE and child of CWE-287.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe202[\"CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe1230[\"CWE-1230: Improper Handling of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe202 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1230\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe202\n    cwe209 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe202\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe202 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe287,cwe1230,cwe201,cwe209 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Primary Source Verification in VerityStream MSOW Solutions** which leads to the **impact:** to discover Social Security Number (SSN) values via a brute-force attack. The **root cause** is the software allowed unauthenticated users to query employee records using PII and the system did not properly restrict queries, and lacked proper rate limiting.\n  - **Root Cause:** Improper query restrictions, missing rate limiting, unauthenticated access\n  - **Weakness:** Exposure of SSN values\n  - **Impact:** Potential for fraud and privacy violation\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-202 as the primary weakness, which is the **exposure of sensitive information through data queries**. The analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the **Vulnerability Description** and **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**. The **root cause** is the MSOW Solutions software, specifically its Primary Source Verification (PSV) search module, allowed unauthenticated users to query employee records using personally identifiable information (PII) such as last names.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by confirming the appropriateness of CWE-202 as a base-level weakness related to the improper handling of sensitive data. The relationships with CWE-201 and CWE-209 indicate that the exposure of sensitive information can occur through different mechanisms, but in this case, it is primarily through data queries.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **root cause** and impact of the vulnerability. CWE-202 accurately describes the **exposure of sensitive information (SSNs)** through data queries, while CWE-306 highlights the **missing authentication** aspect that allows unauthenticated users to make these queries.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response
