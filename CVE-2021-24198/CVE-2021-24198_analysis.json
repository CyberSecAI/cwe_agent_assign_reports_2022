CWE-863 is a class level CWE, which is less specific. CWE-472 is a base level CWE and a child of CWE-642 and CWE-471.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe472[\"CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe642[\"CWE-642: External Control of Critical State Data\"]\n    cwe471[\"CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe472 -->|CHILDOF| cwe642\n    cwe472 -->|CHILDOF| cwe471\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe472,cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe284,cwe285,cwe642,cwe471 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper access control** in the wpDataTables plugin. A low privilege authenticated user can **tamper parameters** to delete data of other users. This leads to the ability to delete data of all users in the same table. The **root cause** is that the system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **improper access control** as the primary weakness. The retriever results pointed to several potential CWEs, including CWE-472, CWE-639, and CWE-863. After reviewing the CWE specifications, CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key was selected as the primary CWE because it best describes the vulnerability where a user can modify the key value identifying the data to access another user's data. The vulnerability description explicitly states that a low privilege authenticated user can **tamper the parameters** to delete the data of another user that are present in the same table through id_key and id_val parameters.\n\nCWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter was considered because the vulnerability involves **tampering parameters**. However, CWE-639 is a better fit because it specifically addresses the authorization bypass aspect.\n\nCWE-863: Incorrect Authorization was also considered, but it is a more general class-level CWE. CWE-639 is a more specific base-level CWE that is a child of CWE-863, making it a better fit.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **improper access control** that allows a low privilege user to delete another user's data by **tampering parameters**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
