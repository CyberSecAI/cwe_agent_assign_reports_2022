The description explicitly mentions \"**Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer**\" which is a form of out-of-bounds read. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms the root cause as \"Access of memory location after the end of buffer (CWE-788)\" and also mentions \"Out-of-bounds read, specifically an access of memory location after end of buffer.\" The impact is \"Memory leak,\" aligning with the sensitive information disclosure.\n\nThe retriever results also support this classification, with CWE-788 (Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer) and CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) being the top candidates. CWE-126 is a variant of CWE-125 and a child of CWE-788, making it a more specific and appropriate choice than CWE-788. While CWE-788 is in the retriever results and the CVE summary, it is discouraged as per MITRE guidance. CWE-126 is allowed.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is considered as a secondary CWE because it represents the impact of the vulnerability. The vulnerability enables the exposure of sensitive information, and CWE-200 captures this aspect. However, it is a class CWE and discouraged.\n\nThe selection of CWE-126 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **access of memory location after the end of the buffer**, which is the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
