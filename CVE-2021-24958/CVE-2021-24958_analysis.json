CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a Compound CWE. CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) are contributing factors, with CWE-79 leading to the **cross-site scripting** issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe862\n    cwe79 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe352\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79,cwe862 secondary\n    class cwe285 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing CSRF protection** and **missing authorization checks**. This allows authenticated users, including subscribers, to modify plugin settings. These settings are not properly sanitized, leading to a **cross-site scripting vulnerability** when the settings are rendered in a web page.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a high confidence in assigning CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery), CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation), and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly shows the **lack of capability and CSRF checks** which allows an authenticated user to inject **cross-site scripting** payloads. This corresponds directly with the definitions and characteristics of these CWEs. The relationship analysis further supports the selection of these CWEs, highlighting the interdependencies and potential vulnerability chains.\n\nThe primary weakness is the **lack of CSRF protection** (CWE-352) as the AJAX action `meks_save_business_selected_account` does not validate the origin of the request. The secondary issues are the **missing authorization checks** (CWE-862), allowing any authenticated user (including subscribers) to modify plugin settings and **improper neutralization of input** (CWE-79), leading to the **cross-site scripting vulnerability**.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was considered but not selected as the evidence points to **missing** rather than **improper** authorization. CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a child of CWE-285 and more accurately reflects the **lack of authorization** checks.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-352 at the Compound level, and CWE-79 and CWE-862 at the Base and Class level respectively. They are well-supported by the evidence and align with the MITRE mapping guidance.",
