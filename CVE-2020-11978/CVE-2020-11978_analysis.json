CWE-94 is a parent of CWE-95 (Eval Injection), CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) and includes examples that translate user input into code. CWE-78 is related to CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command), which is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). The vulnerability involves injecting code, making CWE-94 the most direct fit, while OS Command injection is a potential consequence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe77 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe78 secondary\n    class cwe74,cwe77 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation**, leading to **remote code injection**, ultimately resulting in the ability to execute arbitrary commands. The chain highlights the progression from a lack of input sanitization to the execution of unauthorized commands.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **weakness** as **remote code injection** due to **improper input validation**, leading to arbitrary command execution. The retriever results suggested CWE-94 and CWE-78 as top candidates. After reviewing the descriptions and relationships, CWE-94 was selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability involves the product constructing a code segment using externally-influenced input without proper neutralization. The evidence lies in the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section, which explicitly mentions **remote code injection**.\n\nCWE-78 is considered a secondary candidate because the impact leads to the execution of arbitrary commands, but the root cause is more directly related to code injection. The graph relationships reinforce the hierarchical connection between CWE-74, CWE-77, CWE-78, and CWE-94, justifying the selection of CWE-94 as the most specific and relevant CWE. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, addressing both the root cause (code injection) and a potential impact (OS command execution).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
