## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-113 | Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting') | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-113, which is a variant and a child of CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences) and CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). The relationship analysis highlights that CWE-113 is the most specific and relevant CWE for this vulnerability because it directly addresses the **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers**, leading to HTTP Response Splitting.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with the **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences** in HTTP headers (CWE-113), which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary headers and content into the HTTP response. This leads to HTTP Response Splitting, giving the attacker control of the remaining headers and body of the response. The impact can include cross-site scripting (XSS), cache poisoning, and session hijacking.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" and "CVE Reference Links Content Summary," which clearly indicate the **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences** as the root cause of the HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability.

The selection of CWE-113 is based on the following:
*   The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers**, which directly matches the description of CWE-113.
*   The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms that the FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer GUI fails to properly sanitize or encode CRLF sequences within HTTP headers.
*   CWE-113 is a Variant, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to root causes.
*   The Retriever Results list CWE-113 as the top candidate with a score of 1.0.

Other CWEs were considered but not selected:

*   CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')) is a parent of CWE-113, but CWE-113 is more specific to HTTP headers.
*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) could be a consequence of HTTP Response Splitting but is not the root cause.
*   CWE-444 (Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')) addresses request/response smuggling due to inconsistent interpretation, which is different from the CRLF injection described in this vulnerability.

The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause (improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers) and is a Variant, which is the preferred level of abstraction.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.



## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as "/abs/path" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic
