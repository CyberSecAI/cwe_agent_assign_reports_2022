CWE-215 is a related weakness as it describes the insertion of sensitive information into the debugging code. CWE-200 is a high-level class that represents the impact of the vulnerability, which is the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe489[\"CWE-489: Active Debug Code\"]\n    cwe215[\"CWE-215: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Debugging Code\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe215 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe489 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe215\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe489 primary\n    class cwe215 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **rootcause** of having debug code enabled by default (CWE-489). This leads to the potential insertion of sensitive information into the debugging code (CWE-215), which ultimately results in the exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identifies CWE-489 as the primary weakness due to the \"**Debug function enabled by default**\" rootcause. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the \"**Debug function enabled by default**\" allows an Admin User to see captured packet contents, which may include User credentials. This is a direct match for CWE-489: Active Debug Code, as it involves debug code being enabled in a production environment. The relationship graph shows that CWE-215 can follow CWE-489, which is the insertion of sensitive information into debugging code, ultimately leading to CWE-200, the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nThe retriever results listed CWE-489, CWE-215, and CWE-200. The selection of CWE-489 as the primary weakness is based on the root cause analysis and the fact that it is at the Base level of abstraction. CWE-215 is a secondary weakness because the captured packet contents may include User credentials. If the debug code includes sensitive information, CWE-215 would be an appropriate secondary mapping. CWE-200 is a tertiary mapping because it represents the impact of the vulnerability. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-489 representing the core issue and CWE-215 and CWE-200 representing related concerns.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why it was not selected**: There is no mention of XML in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why it was not selected**: The vulnerability description doesn't mention writing to externally accessible files or directories, so this CWE is not relevant.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why it was not selected**: The vulnerability description doesn't explicitly state unauthorized access to files or directories.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
