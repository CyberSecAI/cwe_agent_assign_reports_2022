It is a child of CWE-119 **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**, a class-level CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a heap overflow, indicating a write beyond the intended buffer. This aligns well with the description of CWE-787.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **non-hardened usercopy**, which leads to a **heap overflow**, and results in denial of service or privilege escalation. The core weakness is the **heap overflow** caused by writing outside the intended memory bounds.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write** as the primary CWE due to the explicit mention of a **heap overflow** in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links. The **rootcause** is the **non-hardened usercopy**.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states: \"As result of BPF execution, the local user can trigger bug in __cgroup_bpf_run_filter_getsockopt() function that can lead to **heap overflow** (because of **non-hardened usercopy**).\" The CVE reference links also confirm that the **root cause** is related to the `__cgroup_bpf_run_filter_getsockopt()` function and **non-hardened usercopy**, resulting in a **heap overflow**.\n\nCWE-787 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it directly addresses the **out-of-bounds write** condition that results in the **heap overflow**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6800.30\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6445.54\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6376.78\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6164.63\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6097.58\n\n## CWE-128: Wrap-around Error\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n\n## CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n\n## CWE-170: Improper Null Termination\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n\n## CWE-195: Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error\n**Abstraction Level**: variant\n**Similarity Score**: 4.53\n\n## CWE-416: Use After Free\n**Abstraction Level**: variant\n**Similarity Score**: 4.53\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n\n## CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n\n## CWE-1341: Multiple Releases of Same Resource or Handle\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n\n### CWE Selection Details:\n\n*   **CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write:** This is the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **heap overflow**. The reference links also confirm this. Confidence: 0.9\n*   **CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer:** This is a higher-level class that encompasses the more specific CWE-787. The **heap overflow** results from not properly restricting memory buffer operations, making this a relevant secondary consideration. Confidence: 0.7\n\n### CWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   **CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound:** While integer overflows can sometimes lead to buffer overflows, there's no direct evidence in the description to support this.\n*   **CWE-131 Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size:** Although this could potentially contribute to a **heap overflow**, the primary **rootcause** described is **non-hardened usercopy**, which is a more direct cause of the **out-of-bounds write**.\n*   **CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read:** This CWE describes reading outside of buffer bounds and isn't relevant because the vulnerability is about writing outside of buffer bounds.\n*   **CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** This is nearly identical to CWE-787, as it describes a buffer overflow on the heap. However, CWE-787 is preferred because its description more generally describes the issue, whereas CWE-122 is specifically focused on the heap.",
