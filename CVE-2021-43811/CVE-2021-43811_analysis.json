While CWE-94 (Code Injection) is related and can sometimes result from deserialization issues, CWE-502 more precisely captures the root cause of **unsafe YAML loading** leading to arbitrary code execution. CWE-502 is a peer of CWE-915 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes), suggesting a potential for object modification vulnerabilities stemming from deserialization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe915[\"CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\"]\n    \n    cwe502 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe502 --|PEEROF| cwe915\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe502 primary\n    class cwe94,cwe913,cwe915 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **unsafe YAML loading** (CWE-502), which allows an attacker to embed arbitrary code within a configuration file. This leads to the potential execution of that code when the file is deserialized, resulting in arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.\n- CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data (Root Cause)\n- Execution of arbitrary code (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **unsafe YAML loading**, which is directly related to CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data). The vulnerability description states: \"Versions below 2.3.24 use **unsafe YAML loading**, which can be made to execute arbitrary code embedded in config files.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating: \"The vulnerability stems from the use of unsafe YAML loading in Sockeye versions prior to 2.3.24... The unsafe loading of YAML allows for the execution of arbitrary code embedded within the configuration files.\"\n\nCWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')) was considered because the impact is arbitrary code execution. However, the root cause is the deserialization of untrusted data, not the direct injection of code. Therefore, CWE-502 is the more appropriate primary CWE.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause (CWE-502) and a potential impact (CWE-94). The high confidence score reflects the clear alignment between the vulnerability description and the characteristics of CWE-502.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
