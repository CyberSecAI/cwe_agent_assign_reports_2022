This indicates that CWE-205 is a more specific type of observable discrepancy. The vulnerability description mentions an **observable behavioral discrepancy** which is a good match for CWE-205, but the root cause is related to \"improper conditions check in voltage settings\" which leads to the observable discrepancy. Because the root cause is about voltage settings, it is related to hardware. CWE-1256 is also a potential candidate due to the hardware context, but the provided information doesn't explicitly state that software interfaces are improperly restricted. However, the \"improper conditions check in voltage settings\" could be interpreted as such.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe205[\"CWE-205: Observable Behavioral Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe1256[\"CWE-1256: Improper Restriction of Software Interfaces to Hardware Features\"]\n\n    cwe205 -->|CHILDOF| cwe203\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe203 primary\n    class cwe205,cwe1256 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper condition check in voltage settings**, which leads to an **observable behavioral discrepancy**, and ultimately results in information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting weakness. The vulnerability description key phrases and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary both highlight an **observable behavioral discrepancy**, making CWE-203 a strong candidate. The retriever results also list CWE-203 and CWE-205 as potential matches.\n\nThe relationship analysis reveals that CWE-205 is a child of CWE-203, providing a more specific classification. However, the root cause is an \"improper condition check in voltage settings for some Intel(R) Processors\", indicating a hardware context. This makes CWE-1256 a relevant consideration.\n\nThe final decision is to map CWE-203 as the primary CWE because the weakness is an observable discrepancy. However, the root cause of this discrepancy lies in the hardware domain due to an improper condition check in voltage settings. Therefore, CWE-1256 is added as a secondary CWE since it's also caused by voltage settings in the Intel(R) Processors which are hardware.\n\nThe selection of CWE-203 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **observable discrepancy**. While CWE-205 is more specific, the description of CWE-203 aligns closely with the provided evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.
