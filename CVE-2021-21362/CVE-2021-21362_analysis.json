This is a child of CWE-285, Improper Authorization (Class), which is a more general form of the same weakness. CWE-863 is preferred because the vulnerability description indicates that an authorization check was performed, but it was done incorrectly.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a **missing** or **incorrect** authorization check in the `PostPolicyHandler` which allows users to bypass read-only policies. This leads to unauthorized data uploads. The root cause is the **incorrect authorization**, and the impact is the bypass of the readOnly policy.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered CWE-863 as the primary candidate because the vulnerability involves an authorization check that is performed incorrectly, leading to a bypass of read-only policies. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section states \"The vulnerability stems from a missing user policy enforcement in the `PostPolicyHandler` of MinIO. This handler was not properly checking user permissions when processing POST requests with a policy, allowing users to bypass configured read-only policies.\" This is direct evidence supporting the selection of CWE-863.\n\nCWE-285 was considered but ultimately deemed less specific. While CWE-285 describes a general lack of or incorrect authorization, CWE-863 directly addresses the case where an authorization check exists but is flawed.\n\nThe relationship analysis reinforces the decision to choose CWE-863, as it is a child of CWE-285 and provides a more precise classification of the vulnerability. The evidence supports the conclusion that the authorization check was present but implemented incorrectly. The selection of CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the core issue of the vulnerability: an existing authorization mechanism that fails to adequately enforce access control policies.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
