The root cause is the **lack of validation of boundary checks**, which can be mapped to CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input). CWE-1284 can precede CWE-126, as the **lack of validation** can lead to reading beyond the buffer.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    \n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe126\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe126 primary\n    class cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the **lack of validation of boundary checks** (CWE-1284), which leads to a **buffer over-read** (CWE-126).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"**lack of validation of boundary checks**\" as the root cause and \"**buffer over-read**\" as the weakness. The retriever results also lists CWE-126 as the top candidate. CWE-126 is a Variant of CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) and is appropriate because the vulnerability results in reading past the end of the buffer.\n\nThe **lack of validation** of the quantity can be mapped to CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input). This is a Base level CWE and describes how the quantity is not properly validated, allowing attackers to cause unexpected failures.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-126 directly describes the **buffer over-read**, and CWE-1284 describes the **lack of validation** of the quantity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product compares two entities in a security-relevant context, but the comparison is incorrect, which may lead to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, sometimes this weakness is forced to be used due to the lack of in-depth weakness research.
