## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that CWE-287 [Improper Authentication] is a parent of CWE-1390 [Weak Authentication]. Since the vulnerability is due to a **missing** check, which falls under the broader category of **improper** authentication, CWE-287 is a suitable starting point. However, given the specifics of authenticating with an inactive identifier, CWE-1390 becomes relevant. The abstraction level influenced the decision to consider both a class-level CWE (CWE-287) and then a more specific class level CWE (CWE-1390).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing** check for active status of user identifier in `BasicAuthProvider.java`.
2.  **Weakness:** **Insecure Authentication** due to the **failure** to validate the 'active' status.
3.  **Impact:** Unauthorized access by inactive users.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment considered the **missing** check for the active user identifier, suggesting a broader authentication issue. The final decision favored CWE-287 [Improper Authentication] as the primary CWE, because the authentcation was **improper**. The root cause evidence from "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" states "The vulnerability stems from the authentication mechanism not properly validating the 'active' status of user identifiers." However, CWE-1390 [Weak Authentication] was also considered because it more closely describes what is going on, that the authentication is not strong enough, but it is a class.

The selection of CWE-287 [Improper Authentication] is supported by the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary", highlighting that the system **lacked** a crucial authorization check. This aligns with the broader scope of **improper** authentication.

The evidence explicitly supports the identification of a **missing** authorization check for inactive user identifiers in `BasicAuthProvider.java`. This direct evidence reinforces the selection of CWE-287 [Improper Authentication] as the primary classification, with a high confidence score of 0.9.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-45890

## Vulnerability Description
basic/BasicAuthProvider.java in AuthGuard before 0.9.0 allows authentication via an inactive identifier.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** authentication via an inactive identifier
- **product:** AuthGuard
- **version:** before 0.9.0
- **component:** basic/BasicAuthProvider.java

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the authentication mechanism not properly validating the 'active' status of user identifiers. Specifically, the system was authenticating users even if their identifiers (like usernames) were marked as inactive.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Authentication:** The core weakness is the failure to check if a user identifier is active before proceeding with authentication. This allows inactive users to potentially gain unauthorized access.
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The system lacked a crucial authorization check that would have prevented the authentication of inactive identifiers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could potentially gain access to the system by using credentials associated with an inactive user identifier.
- **Circumvention of Security Controls:** The vulnerability effectively bypasses the intended security controls associated with deactivating user identifiers.

**Attack Vectors:**

- An attacker needs valid credentials (username and password) corresponding to an inactive identifier.
- The attacker would then attempt to authenticate through the vulnerable basic authentication mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must have knowledge of a valid username (or other identifier) and password of an account which has been marked as inactive.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability was present in `BasicAuthProvider.java`. The fix involved:
  - Adding a check within the `verifyCredentialsAndGetAccount` method to verify if the `UserIdentifier` is active before authenticating the user.
  -  Returning a `ServiceAuthorizationException` with `ErrorCode.INACTIVE_IDENTIFIER` if the identifier is not active.
  - Adding a test case in `BasicAuthProviderTest.java` to assert that authentication with an inactive identifier fails.
  - Adding the `INACTIVE_IDENTIFIER` error code to the `ErrorCode` enum in `ErrorCode.java`.
  - Adding a default `isActive()` method in the `UserIdentifier` interface

The fix was implemented in commit `9783b1143da6576028de23e15a1f198b1f937b82` and merged into the master branch through pull request #181.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).




## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

### Extended Description
This may allow such characters to be treated as control characters, which are executed client-side in the context of the user's session. Although this can be classified as an injection problem, the more pertinent issue is the improper conversion of such special characters to respective context-appropriate entities before displaying them to the user.

### Alternative Terms

- **CVE-2002-0970:** Browser does not verify Basic Constraints of a certificate, even though it is required, allowing spoofing of trusted certificates.
- **CVE-2002-1407:** Browser does not verify Basic Constraints of a certificate, even though it is required, allowing spoofing of trusted certificates.




## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

### Extended Description
In security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Often primary in cryptographic applications and algorithms.

**[Maintenance]** CWE 4.16 removed a demonstrative example for a hardware module because it was inaccurate and unable to be adapted. The CWE team is developing an alternative.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies
- **CVE-2019-10482:** Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels
- **CVE-2014-0984:** Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.




## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

### Extended Description

- **CVE-2002-1010:** Bypass file restrictions using wildcard character.
- **CVE-2001-0334:** Wildcards generate long string on expansion.




## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

### Extended Description


Because the information is stored in cleartext (i.e., unencrypted), attackers could potentially read it. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.


When organizations adopt cloud services, it can be easier for attackers to access the data from anywhere on the Internet.


In some systems/environments such as cloud, the use of "double encryption" (at both the software and hardware layer) might be required, and the developer might be solely responsible for both layers, instead of shared responsibility with the administrator of the broader system/environment.


### Alternative Terms

ChildOf -> CWE-311
ChildOf -> CWE-311
ChildOf -> CWE-922

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Different people use "cleartext" and "plaintext" to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.
- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie
- **CVE-2009-1466:** password stored in cleartext in a file with insecure permissions
