It is a child of both CWE-538 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory) and CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information). CWE-201 is a peer of CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) and CWE-202 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries), which suggests similar data exposure issues. CWE-287 is a class level CWE, and its mapping is discouraged.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe202[\"CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe538\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe209\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe202\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe287 secondary\n    class cwe538,cwe200,cwe209,cwe202,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insertion of session secrets into Impala logs (CWE-532)**. This leads to **exposure of sensitive information**, allowing an attacker to **hijack sessions and execute unauthorized statements**. The final impact is **privilege escalation and incorrect audit logging.**\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description highlights that Impala sessions use a 16-byte secret, which is then logged. This **rootcause** directly aligns with **CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File)**. The vulnerability description key phrases also reinforce this connection, pointing out the \"**use of session secrets in Impala logs**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms that the **session secrets are written to Impala logs**.\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) was considered because the logs are sent/available to certain users. However, CWE-532 is more specific to the logging context, making it a better fit.\n\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) were considered due to the resulting privilege escalation, but the root cause is the exposure of the session secret, not an authentication or authorization flaw. Thus, they are less direct mappings.\n\nThe primary mapping, CWE-532, is at the Base level of abstraction, aligning with the preferred level for root cause analysis.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
