It is related to CWE-915 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes) and CWE-913 (Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources). CWE-1321 can precede CWE-471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)). These relationships indicate that prototype pollution can lead to modification of assumed immutable data.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1321[\"CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\"]\n    cwe915[\"CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n    cwe471[\"CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\"]\n    \n    cwe1321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe915\n    cwe1321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe1321 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe471\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1321 primary\n    class cwe915,cwe913,cwe471 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of object attributes** in the `merge` and `clone` helper methods, leading to **prototype pollution**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is a **prototype pollution** issue in the ZRender library. The `merge` and `clone` helper methods in `src/core/util.ts` do not properly sanitize input, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the prototype of the base object.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"using `merge` and `clone` helper methods in the `src/core/util.ts` module results in **prototype pollution**.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating: \"The vulnerability stems from prototype pollution in the `merge` and `clone` helper methods... These methods, when used to merge or clone objects, don't properly sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the prototype of the base object.\" The summary also states: \"The vulnerability is tracked as CWE-1321 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype).\"\n\nThe best match is CWE-1321 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')). The description of CWE-1321 aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description. \"The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype.\"\n\nI considered other CWEs, but they were not as specific as CWE-1321. For example, CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) is a broader category that does not specifically address prototype pollution. CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) is related to authorization issues, which is not the primary concern in this vulnerability.\nThe assigned CWE is at the optimal level of specificity (Variant) and accurately represents the weakness.",
