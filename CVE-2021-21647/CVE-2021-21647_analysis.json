CWE-862 is a child of CWE-285, representing a specific case where authorization is entirely missing, which aligns precisely with the vulnerability description. The abstraction level of CWE-862 as a Class led to considering if a more specific Base or Variant CWE exists, but the evidence strongly suggests that the authorization check is simply absent.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which allows an attacker with Item/Read permissions to schedule builds without Item/Build permissions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-862 as the primary weakness due to the **lack of a permission check**. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the plugin **\"does not perform a permission check\"** in an HTTP endpoint. This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-862: \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\"\n\nThe **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** reinforces this by stating: \"**Missing permission check:** The plugin does not verify if the user has the necessary 'Item/Build' permission before allowing them to schedule builds via an HTTP endpoint.\"\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was considered but ultimately deemed less specific than CWE-862. The mapping guidance for CWE-285 discourages its use, recommending to \"Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.\" Since the vulnerability is due to a complete absence of authorization rather than an incorrect implementation, CWE-862 is the more appropriate choice.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity. While it is a Class-level CWE, there are no further Base or Variant level children that more accurately capture the **missing permission check**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
