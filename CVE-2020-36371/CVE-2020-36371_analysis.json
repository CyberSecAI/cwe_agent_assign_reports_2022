CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is a more specific variant that fits the stack overflow aspect of the vulnerability. These relationships help refine the classification from a general issue (CWE-119) to a more specific manifestation (CWE-787, CWE-121) due to uncontrolled recursion (CWE-674).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe674 -->|LEADS TO| cwe121\n    cwe674 -->|LEADS TO| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe674 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe121 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **uncontrolled recursion** (CWE-674) in the parser, leading to **stack exhaustion** and ultimately a **stack-based buffer overflow** (CWE-121) and/or **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787), resulting in a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered the provided vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference links. The key phrase \"stack overflow\" and the description of excessive recursion point towards CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) as the primary weakness. The reference links confirm the **root cause** is **unbounded recursion** in the parser, which leads to **stack overflow**.\n\nThe graph relationships support the selection of CWE-674 as the primary cause, with CWE-121 and CWE-787 as potential consequences. The evidence clearly indicates **uncontrolled recursion** as the **root cause**, making CWE-674 the most appropriate primary classification. The stack exhaustion leads to a stack-based buffer overflow or out-of-bounds write. These are lower-level consequences of the uncontrolled recursion, but are worth listing. The selection of CWE-674 is at the optimal level of specificity, representing the **root cause** of the vulnerability, as supported by the vulnerability description and CVE reference details.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled
