It's related to CWE-642 (Improper Neutralization during Cast) and CWE-669 (Incorrect Behavior Order) and CWE-602 (Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security). CWE-287 is a **Class** level CWE, and it is a parent of CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). CWE-472 is a **Base** level CWE and child of CWE-642 and CWE-471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe565[\"CWE-565: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe472[\"CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\"]\n    cwe642[\"CWE-642: External Control of Critical Parameters\"]\n    cwe669[\"CWE-669: Incorrect Behavior Order\"]\n    cwe602[\"CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe471[\"CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\"]\n\n    cwe565 -->|CHILDOF| cwe642\n    cwe565 -->|CHILDOF| cwe669\n    cwe565 -->|CHILDOF| cwe602\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe472 -->|CHILDOF| cwe642\n    cwe472 -->|CHILDOF| cwe471\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe565 primary\n    class cwe287,cwe472 secondary\n    class cwe642,cwe669,cwe602,cwe306,cwe471 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper validation of administrative cookies** (CWE-565). This leads to **authentication bypass** which could then lead to unauthorized privileged account creation, configuration changes or rogue DHCP server settings.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **CWE-565: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking**. The **rootcause** \"improper validation of administrative cookie\" and the \"vulnerabilities\" listed in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary of \"Authentication Bypass\" and \"Lack of request validation\" support this. The vulnerability description states that \"Authentication bypass can be achieved by including an administrative cookie that the device does not validate.\" This directly aligns with CWE-565's description: \"The product relies on the existence or values of cookies when performing security-critical operations, but it does not properly ensure that the setting is valid for the associated user.\"\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication) was considered because the impact of the vulnerability is authentication bypass. However, CWE-287 is a more general **Class** level CWE, and the evidence points to a more specific issue related to cookie handling. Therefore, CWE-565 is more appropriate.\nCWE-472 (External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter) was considered because cookies are often assumed to be immutable. The crafted cookie could be considered an externally controlled parameter that is not properly validated. However, CWE-565 better captures the essence of the vulnerability, which is the reliance on unvalidated cookie data for security decisions. Therefore, it is more appropriate to classify this as **CWE-565: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
