The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to view a stack trace revealing system information. |\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability results in the exposure of sensitive information, but a more specific CWE is available. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-497, which is a Base level CWE. CWE-497 is a child of CWE-200, which is a class level CWE. This indicates a hierarchical relationship. The choice of CWE-497 reflects the specific exposure of system information, rather than a general information exposure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe497 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing** or **improper** restriction on the `/chart` endpoint, leading to the exposure of sensitive system information.\n  - The root cause is the **failure** to properly restrict access to the `/chart` endpoint.\n  - The weakness is the **exposure** of a stack trace that reveals the home directory path and the existence of files in the `tmp` directory.\n  - The impact is the potential use of this information for further attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **exposure of sensitive system information**. The `/chart` endpoint allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to view a stack trace, revealing the path of the home directory on disk and whether specific files exist in the `tmp` directory.\n\nThe selection of CWE-497 is based on the following evidence from the vulnerability description:\n- \"Affected versions of Atlassian Bamboo allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to view a stack trace that may reveal the path for the home directory in disk and if certain files exists on the tmp directory, via a Sensitive Data Exposure vulnerability in the /chart endpoint.\"\n- \"Root cause of vulnerability: A Sensitive Data Exposure vulnerability exists in the `/chart` endpoint of Atlassian Bamboo.\"\n- \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The `/chart` endpoint allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to view a stack trace, which can reveal the path of the home directory on disk and whether specific files exist in the `tmp` directory.\"\n\nCWE-200 was considered but not used as the primary CWE because CWE-497 provides a more specific classification of the vulnerability, focusing on the exposure of system-level information. While CWE-200 broadly covers the exposure of sensitive information, CWE-497 is a more precise match for the specific type of information being exposed in this case.\n\nThe selection of CWE-497 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately represents the weakness, which is the exposure of sensitive system information to an unauthorized control sphere. This is a base-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
