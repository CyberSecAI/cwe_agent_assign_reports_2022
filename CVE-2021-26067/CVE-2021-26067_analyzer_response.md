# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2021-26067

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-497 | Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to view a stack trace revealing system information. |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability results in the exposure of sensitive information, but a more specific CWE is available. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-497, which is a Base level CWE. CWE-497 is a child of CWE-200, which is a class level CWE. This indicates a hierarchical relationship. The choice of CWE-497 reflects the specific exposure of system information, rather than a general information exposure.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **missing** or **improper** restriction on the `/chart` endpoint, leading to the exposure of sensitive system information.
  - The root cause is the **failure** to properly restrict access to the `/chart` endpoint.
  - The weakness is the **exposure** of a stack trace that reveals the home directory path and the existence of files in the `tmp` directory.
  - The impact is the potential use of this information for further attacks.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **exposure of sensitive system information**. The `/chart` endpoint allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to view a stack trace, revealing the path of the home directory on disk and whether specific files exist in the `tmp` directory.

The selection of CWE-497 is based on the following evidence from the vulnerability description:
- "Affected versions of Atlassian Bamboo allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to view a stack trace that may reveal the path for the home directory in disk and if certain files exists on the tmp directory, via a Sensitive Data Exposure vulnerability in the /chart endpoint."
- "Root cause of vulnerability: A Sensitive Data Exposure vulnerability exists in the `/chart` endpoint of Atlassian Bamboo."
- "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The `/chart` endpoint allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to view a stack trace, which can reveal the path of the home directory on disk and whether specific files exist in the `tmp` directory."

CWE-200 was considered but not used as the primary CWE because CWE-497 provides a more specific classification of the vulnerability, focusing on the exposure of system-level information. While CWE-200 broadly covers the exposure of sensitive information, CWE-497 is a more precise match for the specific type of information being exposed in this case.

The selection of CWE-497 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately represents the weakness, which is the exposure of sensitive system information to an unauthorized control sphere. This is a base-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
