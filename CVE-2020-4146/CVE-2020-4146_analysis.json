This hierarchical relationship indicates that CWE-1004 is a specific type of weakness related to insecure handling of cookies. CWE-614 (Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute) is another Variant level CWE related to transmission of sensitive data over HTTPS. CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is a Base level CWE that is a parent of CWE-614. The choice of CWE-1004 as primary is because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **missing HttpOnly flag**, directly aligning with CWE-1004's definition.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1004[\"CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Security-Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe1004 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1004 primary\n    class cwe614,cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a **missing HttpOnly flag** (CWE-1004) leading to potential exposure of sensitive cookie data, which can then be exploited by a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **missing HttpOnly flag** as the root cause. The Retriever Results highlighted CWE-1004 (Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag) as the top candidate, aligning perfectly with the vulnerability description.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is the explicit mention of the **missing HttpOnly flag** in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases.\" This directly corresponds to the definition of CWE-1004.\n\nThe graph relationships helped contextualize the vulnerability within a broader scope of cookie security and data transmission issues.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1004 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **missing HttpOnly flag**, which is the core weakness exploited in this vulnerability.",
