It is a child of CWE-407, which deals with uncontrolled resource consumption, but CWE-1333 is more specific. CWE-400, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, is considered as a secondary weakness because it represents the high-level impact of the vulnerability. The relationship between CWE-1333 and CWE-400 is that the inefficient regular expression (CWE-1333) leads to uncontrolled resource consumption and potentially a denial-of-service condition (CWE-400).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Denial of Service')\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Uncontrolled Consumption of Resources\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe400 -->|CAUSES| cwe1333\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe407 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the use of an **inefficient regular expression** (CWE-1333) in the `MessagesController` class of OpenProject. This inefficiency leads to excessive backtracking when processing an unterminated `<pre>` tag with many spaces. The excessive backtracking consumes excessive CPU cycles, ultimately resulting in uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) and potentially a denial-of-service condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-1333 as the primary weakness due to the **inefficient regular expression**, which is the root cause of the vulnerability. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly states that the vulnerability stems from the regex ` %r{<pre>((.|\\s)*?)</pre>}m` leading to excessive backtracking. This aligns directly with CWE-1333's description of a regular expression with inefficient complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles. \"The `(.|\\s)` part allows the regex engine to match a space character in two ways, leading to excessive backtracking when processing an unterminated `<pre>` tag with many spaces.\"\n\nCWE-400 is a secondary candidate representing the impact of the vulnerability, where the **inefficient regular expression** causes uncontrolled resource consumption, possibly leading to a denial of service.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-1333 is a base-level weakness that directly describes the root cause, while CWE-400 captures the impact. Higher-level CWEs like CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime) are too abstract.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is too abstract and doesn't directly relate to the specific vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is too high-level and doesn't accurately reflect the specific weakness.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names.

The vulnerability does not involve sensitive information in resources.\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged",
