It is a child of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data), which is a class-level CWE. CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is also a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-311. The relationships show a hierarchy where a general lack of encryption (CWE-311) leads to specific issues of transmitting (CWE-319) or storing (CWE-312) sensitive data in cleartext. The abstraction levels influenced the choice, favoring the more specific base-level CWEs over the general class-level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n\n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe312 secondary\n    class cwe311 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect** use of base64 encoding instead of proper encryption (**ROOT CAUSE**). This leads to **cleartext transmission of sensitive information** (CWE-319), where an attacker can intercept and decode the credentials. The impact is unauthorized access to the router.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the most accurate CWE based on the vulnerability description and related information. The description clearly states that the router sends username and password credentials as base64. The key phrase is \"**cleartext storage of sensitive information** and sends username and password as base64.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that the root cause is the use of base64 encoding, which leads to **cleartext transmission** of credentials.\n\nThe Retriever Results listed CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) as the top combined result. However, based on the evidence, the credentials are not only stored, but transmitted in a **cleartext** format (base64), therefore CWE-319 is a more accurate primary classification.\n\nCWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is chosen because the vulnerability involves the transmission of username and password credentials using base64 encoding, which is a form of **cleartext transmission**.\n> **Vulnerability Description:** RICON Industrial Cellular Router S9922L 16.10.3(3794) is affected by **cleartext storage of sensitive information** and sends username and password as base64.\n> **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** The RICON Industrial Cellular Router sends username and password credentials using base64 encoding instead of proper encryption.\n\nCWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is considered as a secondary candidate because it highlights that the credentials are stored without proper encryption which is an aspect of the vulnerability, however, the credentials are sent as base64, so CWE-319 is a better fit.\n> **Vulnerability Description:** RICON Industrial Cellular Router S9922L 16.10.3(3794) is affected by **cleartext storage of sensitive information** and sends username and password as base64.\n\nCWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) was considered because base64 is easily decodable, and it might be considered as plaintext. However, since it is being transmitted using base64, it is not completely plaintext which makes CWE-319 a better fit.\n> **Vulnerability Description:** RICON Industrial Cellular Router S9922L 16.10.3(3794) is affected by **cleartext storage of sensitive information** and sends username and password as base64.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the weakness. CWE-319 describes the **cleartext transmission**, while CWE-312 highlights the storage aspect. This ensures that both the transmission and storage vulnerabilities are identified.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.83\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-316: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext in memory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
