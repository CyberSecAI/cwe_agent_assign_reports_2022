These are peer vulnerabilities.\nThe abstraction levels also influence the choice. CWE-362 is a class, while CWE-415 and CWE-416 are variants, representing specific types of memory corruption that could arise from the race condition.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe415[\"CWE-415: Double Free\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -- PEEROF --> cwe415\n    cwe362 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe416\n    cwe362 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe415\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe416,cwe415 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **concurrent access to a shared resource** (CWE-362). This leads to corruption of pointers and reference counters, which ultimately results in heap corruption. The heap corruption can manifest as use-after-free (CWE-416) or double-free (CWE-415) conditions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the **root cause** and potential consequences of the vulnerability. The description explicitly mentions **concurrent access to a shared resource** as the **root cause**, which aligns with CWE-362. The resulting heap corruption suggests memory management issues like use-after-free or double-free.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description key phrases: \"**rootcause:** **concurrent access to shared resource**\" supports the selection of CWE-362. The statement that \"Two threads call one or both functions concurrently leading to corruption of pointers and reference counters which in turn can lead to heap corruption\" strongly supports the classification.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-362 can precede CWE-416 and CWE-415. This indicates that the race condition can lead to these memory corruption issues.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity. CWE-362 captures the general **root cause** of the race condition, while CWE-416 and CWE-415 represent the potential consequences of heap corruption. More information would be required to select more specific variants of CWE-362.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
