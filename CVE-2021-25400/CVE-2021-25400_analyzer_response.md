# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-926 | Improper Export of Android Application Components | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability involves intent redirection in Samsung Internet, allowing attackers to execute privileged actions, which directly aligns with the improper export of Android application components without proper restrictions. |
| CWE-285 | Improper Authorization | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The root cause is an authorization bypass where the application fails to properly validate the origin or content of the intent, allowing an attacker to perform actions they are not authorized to do. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-926, is a Variant of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), indicating a hierarchical relationship where the specific issue of improper component export leads to broader authorization problems. The vulnerability chain involves the improper export of an Android component, leading to potential execution of privileged actions due to a lack of authorization controls. CWE-927 (Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication) was considered but deemed less relevant as the vulnerability focuses more on the improper export and redirection rather than the use of implicit intents for sensitive data transmission.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **Intent redirection vulnerability**, leading to the ability of an attacker to **execute privileged actions**. The root cause is the **improper export of Android application components**, which then results in the **improper authorization** of actions performed via redirected intents.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on the "Intent redirection vulnerability" and its impact of executing privileged actions. The primary CWE identified is CWE-926 (Improper Export of Android Application Components), which directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability described in the CVE. The supporting evidence comes from the vulnerability description, which states "Intent redirection vulnerability in Samsung Internet prior to version 14.0.1.20 allows attacker to execute privileged action." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also states, "Root Cause: Intent redirection vulnerability." and "Allows an attacker to execute privileged actions." This indicates a lack of proper access control and security measures on the exported components.

The relationship graph influenced the selection by highlighting the hierarchical connection between CWE-926 and CWE-285. This confirmed that the improper export is a specific instance of a broader authorization issue.

The selected CWE, CWE-926, is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the mechanism of the vulnerability – the improper export of Android application components – rather than a more general category like improper access control.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.



## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.



## CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies multiple attributes, properties, or fields that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control which attributes can be modified.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-99: Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
