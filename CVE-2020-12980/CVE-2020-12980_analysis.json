The secondary CWE is CWE-125 **Out-of-bounds Read**, which is also a Base level CWE and a child of CWE-119. Both CWE-787 and CWE-125 represent specific types of memory access errors.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper memory access** due to the driver's failure to validate the boundaries of the memory buffer. This leads to both an **out-of-bounds read** and an **out-of-bounds write**, which can then result in **escalation of privilege** or **denial of service**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the presence of both an **out-of-bounds write and read** vulnerability in the AMD Graphics Driver. The vulnerability description clearly states that the **weakness** is an **out of bounds write and read**, which aligns directly with CWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write** and CWE-125 **Out-of-bounds Read**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this by stating that the root cause is an **out-of-bounds write and read** vulnerability. The retriever results also list CWE-787 and CWE-125 as potential candidates.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 and CWE-125 is based on the specific evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level for mapping.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n*This CWE was considered, however, there is no evidence in the description that an incorrect calculation of the buffer size took place. The root cause of the vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write and read.*\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n*This CWE was considered, however, there is no evidence in the description that the buffer access uses an incorrect length value.*\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n*This CWE was considered, however, there is no evidence in the description that an integer underflow caused this vulnerability.*\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
