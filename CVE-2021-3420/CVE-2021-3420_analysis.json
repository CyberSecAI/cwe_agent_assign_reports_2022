The follow-on impact of **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)** is also included, but it is secondary to the root cause.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n*   CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') - While a buffer overflow is the end result, the root cause is the integer overflow, not a missing size check during a buffer copy. Therefore, CWE-120 is less appropriate.\n*   CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error - There's no explicit mention of truncation in the description.\n*   CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input - While **improper overflow validation** is mentioned, the direct result is an integer overflow. This CWE is too general.\n*   CWE-195: Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error - No mention of signed/unsigned conversion issues.\n*   CWE-128: Wrap-around Error - Very similar to CWE-190, but CWE-190 is more specific and commonly used.\n*   CWE-839: Numeric Range Comparison Without Minimum Check - The description doesn't mention missing minimum value checks.\n*   CWE-193: Off-by-one Error - Not applicable as the issue is not related to off-by-one errors.\n*   CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read - The issue is about an out-of-bounds *write*, not read.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)** accurately describes the **weakness** and root cause, and **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)** describes the impact of this overflow.",
