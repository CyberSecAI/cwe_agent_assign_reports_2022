CWE-415, Double Free, is a peer of CWE-416, and could be present as well. Both are child of CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference). The abstraction levels influenced the decision by favoring the variant level for the most accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe415[\"CWE-415: Double Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on a Resource after Expiration\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe415 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe415 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe415 --|PEEROF| cwe416\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe415 secondary\n    class cwe825,cwe672 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with improper memory management in the `get_token` function, leading to either a **double free** or a **use-after-free** condition. The final impact is a crash (segmentation fault).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states a \"**use after free**\" in `info_width_internal` in `bk_info.c`. This aligns directly with CWE-416. The CVE reference links content summary further supports this by mentioning that the root cause lies in the `get_token` function, where `sfree` calls lead to freeing memory that is still in use. This confirms the **use-after-free** condition.\n\nThe graph relationships and retriever results also influenced the selection. CWE-416 has the highest retriever score, and its variant level of abstraction is preferred. CWE-415 is a peer of CWE-416, and the CVE description mentions the possibility of a **double-free** condition as well, so it is included as a secondary CWE.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly describe the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is improper memory management leading to a **use-after-free** condition.\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"A **use after free** in info_width_internal in bk_info.c in Halibut 1.2 allows an attacker to cause a segmentation fault or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted text document.\"\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary is: \"The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the `get_token` function within `input.c`. Specifically, the issue stems from `sfree` calls within this function which can lead to freeing memory that is still in use or freeing the same memory twice.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n#
