# Analysis for CVE-2021-42614

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-415 | Double Free | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-416, Use After Free, which is a variant-level CWE. CWE-415, Double Free, is a peer of CWE-416, and could be present as well. Both are child of CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference). The abstraction levels influenced the decision by favoring the variant level for the most accurate representation of the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with improper memory management in the `get_token` function, leading to either a **double free** or a **use-after-free** condition. The final impact is a crash (segmentation fault).

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary.

The vulnerability description explicitly states a "**use after free**" in `info_width_internal` in `bk_info.c`. This aligns directly with CWE-416. The CVE reference links content summary further supports this by mentioning that the root cause lies in the `get_token` function, where `sfree` calls lead to freeing memory that is still in use. This confirms the **use-after-free** condition.

The graph relationships and retriever results also influenced the selection. CWE-416 has the highest retriever score, and its variant level of abstraction is preferred. CWE-415 is a peer of CWE-416, and the CVE description mentions the possibility of a **double-free** condition as well, so it is included as a secondary CWE.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly describe the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is improper memory management leading to a **use-after-free** condition.
The evidence from the vulnerability description is: "A **use after free** in info_width_internal in bk_info.c in Halibut 1.2 allows an attacker to cause a segmentation fault or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted text document."
The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary is: "The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the `get_token` function within `input.c`. Specifically, the issue stems from `sfree` calls within this function which can lead to freeing memory that is still in use or freeing the same memory twice."

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not initialize a critical resource.

- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource

**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77

**Description**:
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
