CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119, which is a class-level CWE.\nThe relationships influenced the selection by focusing on the most specific, base-level CWE available that describes the **memory corruption**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a specially crafted file that, when parsed by Adobe Illustrator, leads to **memory corruption**, ultimately resulting in remote code execution.\n  - Root Cause: Crafted file causing memory corruption.\n  - Weakness: **Memory corruption** due to out-of-bounds write.\n  - Impact: Remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points towards **memory corruption** due to an out-of-bounds write when parsing a specially crafted file. The primary evidence is the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which indicates \"**weakness:** **memory corruption**\". Also, the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section states \"**Root cause of vulnerability**: **Memory corruption**\" and \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: **Memory corruption** leading to arbitrary code execution.\" The Retriever Results list CWE-787 as the top candidate with a score of 1.0. The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" also lists CWE-787 as the \"Primary CWE Match\". The relationships between CWEs influenced the final selection by ensuring the chosen CWE is at the appropriate level of specificity. The evidence supports that the **memory corruption** is directly caused by writing out of bounds. Therefore, CWE-787 is the most appropriate choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.

This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation.
