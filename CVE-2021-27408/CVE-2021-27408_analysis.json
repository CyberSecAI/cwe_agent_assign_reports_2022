CWE-125 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), but CWE-125 is more specific and thus a better fit. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is included as a secondary CWE since the description mentions it can lead to arbitrary code execution when chained with an **out-of-bounds write**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125), which can lead to information leakage. If this is chained with an **out-of-bounds write** vulnerability (CWE-787), it can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-125 as the primary weakness, based on the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** and the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**, which explicitly mentions \"**out-of-bounds read**\". The Retriever Results also supports this, listing CWE-125 as the top match. The evidence from the vulnerability description indicates that the product is vulnerable to an **out-of-bounds read**, which is a clear match for CWE-125. The description explicitly uses the term \"**out-of-bounds read**,\" so there is strong evidence for this classification.\n\nThe inclusion of CWE-787 as a secondary weakness is based on the description that the **out-of-bounds read** can be chained with an **out-of-bounds write** to achieve arbitrary code execution. While not the primary weakness, the potential for this chain warrants its inclusion. My confidence in the primary CWE is high (1.0), while the confidence in the secondary CWE is lower (0.5) due to the dependency on another vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as CWE-125 directly represents the **out-of-bounds read** vulnerability and CWE-787 represents the potential chained **out-of-bounds write** vulnerability.",
