Using a weak PRNG directly relates to this issue. |\n| CWE-335 | Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: If the **insecure key generation** resulted from improper seeding, this CWE is relevant. |\n| CWE-1391 | Use of Weak Credentials | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate: The **insecure key generation mechanism** could lead to weak credentials being generated. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe analysis focuses on the hierarchical relationships stemming from CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values), which is a Class-level CWE encompassing issues related to weak randomness. CWE-338 (Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)) and CWE-335 (Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)) are both children of CWE-330, providing more specific classifications. CWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials) is also considered due to the potential outcome of the weak key generation, but it's a Class-level CWE and less directly related to the root cause than CWE-338. The choice of CWE-338 as the primary mapping reflects its Base level of abstraction and direct relevance to the **insecure key generation mechanism**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe338[\"CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\"]\n    cwe335[\"CWE-335: Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n    \n    cwe338 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n    cwe335 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n    cwe1391 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe338 primary\n    class cwe335,cwe1391 secondary\n    class cwe330 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure key generation mechanism**. This leads to the use of weak keys for encrypting properties. The impact is the potential exposure of sensitive data due to the compromised encryption.\n\n*   **Root Cause:** **Insecure key generation mechanism**\n*   **Weakness:** Use of weak cryptographic keys (CWE-338)\n*   **Impact:** Potential exposure of sensitive data\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **insecure key generation mechanism**. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links points to a problem with how keys are generated for encrypting properties in JetBrains TeamCity. The retriever results suggested several candidate CWEs, including CWE-338, CWE-335 and CWE-1391.\n\nThe final decision to map the vulnerability primarily to CWE-338 is based on the direct link between the **insecure key generation mechanism** and the use of a cryptographically weak PRNG. As the description says \"*The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in a security context, but the PRNG's algorithm is not cryptographically strong.*\" which is essentially what the vulnerability description states.\n\nCWE-335 is a secondary consideration if the PRNG was not seeded correctly. The evidence is not detailed enough to determine if the seeds were not properly managed.\n\nCWE-1391 is a secondary consideration because it represents the potential outcome of the insecure key generation. However, it is less specific than CWE-338, which focuses on the underlying cause.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-338 being a Base-level CWE that directly addresses the **insecure key generation mechanism**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-335: Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) but does not correctly manage seeds.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm or scheme that produces insufficient entropy, leaving patterns or clusters of values that are more likely to occur than others.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
