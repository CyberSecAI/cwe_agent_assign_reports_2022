CWE-190 can **precede** CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which is a parent of CWE-787.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) due to an **improper** configuration. This leads to **heap corruption** (CWE-787), which can lead to remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is clearly an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) in 32-bit Redis versions, which is triggered when the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration is set to a high value. The **integer overflow** can lead to an undersized memory allocation, which then results in **heap corruption** (CWE-787).\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states: \"Redis is an open-source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In affected versions of Redis an **integer overflow** bug in 32-bit Redis version 4.0 or newer could be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution.\"\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also states: \"Integer overflow in the handling of the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter on 32-bit systems... The integer overflow results in an undersized memory allocation that allows a subsequent heap overflow when parsing a large input bulk from a client.\"\n\nBased on the evidence, the primary CWE is CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound). The resulting **heap corruption** is best represented by CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read): While out-of-bounds access is possible, the primary issue is with the write, not the read.\n*   CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value): This is not the primary issue because the overflow leads to *less* memory being allocated, not more.\n*   CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input): While there is a **lack of validation**, it is the resulting **integer overflow** that causes the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly represent the **root cause** (CWE-190) and the immediate consequence (CWE-787) of the vulnerability.",
