CWE-280 and CWE-639 are related to the impact and how the attacker can exploit the insecure default. CWE-1188 is the most specific Base level CWE. CWE-639 is a child of CWE-863 and CWE-284.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1188[\"CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default\"]\n    cwe280[\"CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1188 primary\n    class cwe280,cwe639 secondary\n    class cwe863,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure default configuration** (CWE-1188), leading to **improper handling of insufficient permissions** (CWE-280) and ultimately an **authorization bypass** (CWE-639), allowing a read-only user to gain administrative privileges.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the root cause described as the **default configuration applied for console authentication and authorization**. The retriever results suggested several CWEs related to access control and authorization, with CWE-284, CWE-639, and CWE-269 being prominent. However, considering the specific nature of the vulnerability stemming from an insecure default configuration, CWE-1188 stands out as the most accurate primary mapping. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms the root cause as \"The vulnerability stems from the default configuration for console authentication and authorization.\" The vulnerability allows \"an authenticated, local attacker with read-only privileges to obtain administrative privileges using the console port in the default SD-WAN configuration.\" The other CWEs are related to the resulting impact which is a bypass of authorization due to this default configuration.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
