Additionally, the relationships of CWE-656 to other CWEs like CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) and CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) provides further context. Since the vulnerability involves hiding secrets on the client-side, relying on the obscurity of HTML password fields, CWE-656 fits well. CWE-317 is a relevant child but the obfuscation method is not technically cleartext storage but rather a weak attempt to hide data in the GUI.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe656[\"CWE-656: Reliance on Security Through Obscurity\"]\n    cwe317[\"CWE-317: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in GUI\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n\n    cwe317 -->|CHILDOF| cwe312\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe656\n    cwe259 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe656\n    cwe321 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe656\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe656 primary\n    class cwe317 secondary\n    class cwe259,cwe321,cwe798 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** of using client-side obfuscation for **hide SSH secrets, Windows passwords, and SNMP strings**. The next step is that an attacker can use developer tools to bypass the obfuscation and view the credentials. The final impact is the potential for unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **weakness** of using HTML password field obfuscation to **hide SSH secrets, Windows passwords, and SNMP strings**. The retriever results pointed to CWE-656 (Reliance on Security Through Obscurity) as a strong candidate, aligning with the description that the \"strength depends heavily on its obscurity.\"\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms that the **root cause** is the inadequate protection of sensitive credentials using client-side mechanisms. The attacker can easily reveal stored credentials, which aligns with the impact.\n\nCWE-656 is chosen because the protection mechanism (HTML password fields) relies on obscurity. An attacker with minimal effort using readily available browser tools can bypass it.\n\nCWE-317 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in GUI) was considered but not chosen as the primary because the credentials are not technically stored in cleartext but rather obfuscated, making CWE-656 more accurate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-656 is at the Class level because a more specific Base or Variant CWE was not a perfect fit, and this Class accurately captures the essence of relying on obscurity for security.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
