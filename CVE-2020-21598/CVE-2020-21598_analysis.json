CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-787, specifying that the buffer is allocated on the heap. CWE-119 is a more general class-level CWE that describes improper restriction of operations within memory bounds. While CWE-122 and CWE-787 are related, CWE-787 is the more accurate base level description of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe122 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the processing of a crafted file. This crafted file triggers a **heap buffer overflow** in the `ff_hevc_put_unweighted_pred_8_sse` function (CWE-787), potentially leading to denial of service or arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a **heap buffer overflow** due to a crafted file in `libde265`. The primary CWE is CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) because the root cause is writing past the allocated buffer. This is supported by the vulnerability description which explicitly states \"**heap buffer overflow**\" in the `ff_hevc_put_unweighted_pred_8_sse` function. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also states: \"A **heap-buffer-overflow** occurs within the `ff_hevc_put_unweighted_pred_8_sse` function.\"\n\nCWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) was considered as a more specific variant of CWE-787 since the overflow occurs on the heap. While this information is valuable, the core issue remains the out-of-bounds write, making CWE-787 the most appropriate primary classification.\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) was also considered, as it's a more general class encompassing buffer overflows. However, the availability of the more specific CWE-787 makes it a better choice. The mapping guidance for CWE-119 explicitly discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the **root cause** (CWE-787) and the specific type of buffer overflow (CWE-122), while avoiding overly general classifications (CWE-119). The decision is based on the provided evidence, relationship analysis, and mapping guidance.",
