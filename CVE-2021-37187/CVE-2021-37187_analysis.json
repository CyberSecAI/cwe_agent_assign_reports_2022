CWE-522 is a parent Class of CWE-257, but CWE-257 is more specific. CWE-259 is a PeerOf CWE-257, which means that they represent alternative classifications for similar weaknesses. The authenticated attacker retrieving a password file with reversible passwords is best described by Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format [CWE-257].\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe257[\"CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    \n    cwe257 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe257 -->|PEEROF| cwe259\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe257 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe259 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **weak credential storage** as the root cause. This leads to the ability to retrieve and decrypt stored credentials, ultimately resulting in an attacker gaining access to other user accounts.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **weakness** of storing passwords in a recoverable format, which directly aligns with the vulnerability description. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-257 as a top candidate. The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is \"Weak Credential Storage\" and that \"Stored credentials can be retrieved and decrypted.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-257 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately captures the core issue of storing passwords in a format that allows for their recovery. While CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a broader category, CWE-257 provides a more precise description of the vulnerability. CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) was also considered but deemed less relevant as the issue is not about hard-coded passwords but rather about how passwords are stored.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users.
