However, CWE-639 is more specific, dealing with user-controlled keys, which isn't explicitly mentioned but could be implied. The relationship between CWE-863 and CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is also important, as incorrect authorization often leads to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe863 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863). Because of the **incorrect authorization**, an authenticated attacker can retrieve the `changedDate` attribute of arbitrary objects, leading to **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200). While the description doesn't explicitly state user-controlled keys, the possibility exists, which could include CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the description points towards an authorization issue where read access is not properly controlled. The core issue is that the application **does not properly control read access** for certain client actions. This allows an authenticated attacker to retrieve the `changedDate` attribute of arbitrary objects, even without read access.\n\nBased on the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", the **root cause of the vulnerability** is **incorrect authorization**. This aligns well with CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). The **weakness** leads to **improper access control** resulting in **information disclosure**. An authenticated attacker can retrieve sensitive information (`changedDate` attribute).\n\nCWE-863 is a Class-level CWE, and the mapping guidance suggests examining its children for a better fit. One child is CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key). While not explicitly stated, the possibility of user-controlled keys being involved exists. However, there is no direct evidence for this, so this remains a secondary consideration.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is also considered because the attacker retrieves the `changedDate` attribute. However, CWE-200 is discouraged as it represents the technical impact rather than the root cause. The root cause is still the authorization bypass.\n\nThe final decision is to assign CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as the primary CWE, with CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) and CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) as secondary considerations. This is because the primary issue stems from how the application incorrectly handles authorization checks, leading to unintended information exposure.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children",
