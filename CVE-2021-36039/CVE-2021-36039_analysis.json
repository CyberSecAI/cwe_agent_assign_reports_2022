It has peer relationships with CWE-345. The secondary CWE, CWE-200, is a class-level weakness that is a child of CWE-668.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe707[\"CWE-707: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Required by Output Context\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n\n    cwe20 -- CHILDOF --> cwe707\n    cwe20 -- PEEROF --> cwe345\n    cwe200 -- CHILDOF --> cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20) of the `quoteId` parameter, which leads to sensitive information disclosure (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitial analysis identified **improper input validation** as the root cause, as stated in the vulnerability description: \"Magento Commerce versions 2.4.2 (and earlier), 2.4.2-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.7 (and earlier) are affected by an **improper input validation** vulnerability via the `quoteId` parameter. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also mentions **Improper Input Validation** and **Incorrect Authorization** as contributing factors, with the impact being arbitrary file system read.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is considered the primary weakness because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions it. However, CWE-20 is a Class-level CWE and the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nThe graph relationships did not significantly influence the decision, as the provided relationships are general and do not point to a more specific cause based on the available information.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is included as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability leads to the disclosure of sensitive information. However, it is an impact rather than a root cause, and the mapping guidance discourages its use.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the available evidence. While more specific CWEs related to input validation could exist, the information provided does not allow for a more precise classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
