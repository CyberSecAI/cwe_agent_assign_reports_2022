Because the specific weakness involves a hard-coded password, CWE-259 is the more specific and appropriate choice. CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) is also relevant because the **hardcoded passwords** are derived from a weak MD5 hash, which allows them to be easily calculated.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    \n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe328\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe259 primary\n    class cwe798,cwe916 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **hardcoded web-panel login passwords**. These passwords are not simply static, but are generated using a predictable algorithm (MD5 hash of username and serial number). The serial number is easily retrievable by an unauthenticated user. This leads to unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the most specific CWE that captures the essence of the vulnerability. The description clearly indicates the presence of **hardcoded passwords**, making CWE-259 the most suitable primary mapping.\n\nThe evidence is strong, stemming directly from the vulnerability description: \"There are **hardcoded web-panel login passwords** for the installer and Enphase accounts.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, stating \"The primary issue is the use of hardcoded passwords... These passwords are generated using a predictable algorithm.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision by highlighting the hierarchical structure. While CWE-798 is a parent, CWE-259 is a more specific variant directly addressing the use of **hardcoded passwords**. CWE-916 is also included as a contributing factor, since the passwords are **hardcoded values derived from the MD5 hash** of the username and serial number mixed with some static strings.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately reflect the root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-259 captures the primary issue of **hardcoded passwords**, while CWE-916 addresses the use of a weak hashing algorithm, and CWE-798 is the more general case.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
