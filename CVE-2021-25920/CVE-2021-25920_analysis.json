It is related to CWE-706 (Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference) as a child. CWE-863 is a **Class** level CWE and a child of CWE-284. While CWE-863 is less specific than CWE-178, it is still relevant as the authorization process is performed incorrectly because of the case sensitivity issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe178[\"CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe706[\"CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe178 -->|CHILDOF| cwe706\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe178 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe706,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **IMPROPER HANDLING OF CASE SENSITIVITY** during user creation (CWE-178). This leads to the possibility of creating accounts with names that differ only in casing. Subsequently, the **INCORRECT AUTHORIZATION** (CWE-863) allows the malicious user to access the victim's data because the application does not properly distinguish between the case-sensitive usernames. The final impact is the ability to read and send sensitive messages on behalf of the victim user.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description, points to **Improper Access Control**. However, the CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides more granular details, leading to a more accurate classification.\n\nThe description states: \"In OpenEMR, versions v2.7.2-rc1 to 6.0.0 are vulnerable to **Improper Access Control** when creating a new user, which leads to a malicious user able to read and send sensitive messages on behalf of the victim user.\"\nAnd the CVE Reference Links Content Summary States:\n\"**Improper Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper access control during user creation, specifically regarding case-sensitive usernames.\"\n\"**Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity (CWE-178):** The system does not treat usernames with different casing as distinct entities.\"\n\"**Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863):** The system fails to correctly authorize access based on user identity, allowing one user to impersonate another.\"\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-178 is a base level vulnerability that causes the incorrect authorization. The final selection of CWE-178 and CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-178 describes the root cause, and CWE-863 describes the authorization issue that arises because of the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Why it was not selected:** This CWE focuses on handling insufficient privileges, which isn't the core issue here. The problem is the incorrect handling of case sensitivity, leading to authorization bypass, not a matter of insufficient privileges.\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Why it was not selected:** This CWE refers to the lack of isolation between functionalities. Although related to access control, it doesn't directly address the case sensitivity issue.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Why it was not selected:** This is a high-level class, and the vulnerability is more accurately described by the base CWE-178.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Why it was not selected:** While related to access control, the core issue is the case sensitivity problem, not the granularity of access control.\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Why it was not selected:** The issue isn't an incorrect assignment of privileges but the failure to distinguish between users based on case sensitivity.\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Why it was not selected:** Too abstract. The vulnerability is better described by the more specific CWE-178.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Why it was not selected:** Similar to CWE-274, the vulnerability isn't about insufficient privileges but the failure to distinguish between users due to case sensitivity.\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Why it was not selected:** Not applicable. The problem isn't with unsafe actions associated with a privilege but with improper handling of case sensitivity.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Why it was not selected:** This CWE focuses on user-controlled keys, but the bypass in this case is due to case sensitivity, not the manipulation of a key.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Why it was not selected:** This is not related to the described vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Why it was not selected:** This vulnerability does not relate to Cross-Site Scripting.\n\n## CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\n**Why it was not selected:** Not related to the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Why it was not selected:** CWE-863 is a better fit as it focuses on incorrect authorization.\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Why it was not selected:** Authentication is present, but authorization fails due to case sensitivity.\n\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n**Why it was not selected:** This CWE is too high-level and doesn't accurately describe the root cause.",
