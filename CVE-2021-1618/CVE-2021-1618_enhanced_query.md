# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-1618

# Vulnerability Description

    Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Intersight Virtual Appliance could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a **path traversal** or **command injection** attack on an affected system. These vulnerabilities are due to **insufficient input validation**. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by using the web-based management interface to do one or both of the following Execute a command using crafted input Upload a file that has been altered using **path traversal** techniques A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read and write arbitrary files or execute arbitrary commands as root on an affected system. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.
