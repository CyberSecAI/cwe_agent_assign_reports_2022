The secondary CWE, CWE-1285, is also a base-level CWE and describes improper validation of input, which is a potential cause of CWE-125. CWE-125 can be preceded by insufficient bounds checking. There isn't a direct parent-child relationship between the two.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe1285[\"CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\"]\n    cwe1285 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe1285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper boundary check** (CWE-1285), which leads to the **out of bound memory access** (CWE-125).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the most relevant CWEs based on the vulnerability description and the provided data. The description highlights an **improper boundary check** that results in an **out of bound memory access**. This points to a failure in validating the input or offset used to access memory, leading to a read beyond the intended boundaries.\n\nThe evidence supporting this assessment comes directly from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\":\n- **rootcause:** **improper boundary check**\n- **weakness:** **out of bound memory access**\n\nBased on the provided information, the selection of CWEs is based on direct evidence and the relationships between them. The primary CWE, CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), accurately reflects the consequence of the vulnerability. The secondary CWE, CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input), represents the root cause of the vulnerability, where the boundary check is not properly implemented, leading to the out-of-bounds read.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n##
