CWE-289 and CWE-1390 are related, as the homograph attack leads to a potential bypass of authentication. CWE-1390 is a class-level CWE, and CWE-289 is a more specific base-level CWE, that is a child of CWE-1390.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1007[\"CWE-1007: Insufficient Visual Distinction of Homoglyphs Presented to User\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe289[\"CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name\"]\n\n    cwe289 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1007 primary\n    class cwe289,cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient visual distinction of homoglyphs (CWE-1007)**, which allows a malicious user to register with a name similar to an existing user. This can lead to an **authentication bypass (CWE-289)** or more generally **weak authentication (CWE-1390)**, ultimately allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized privileges.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis concludes that CWE-1007 is the primary weakness, as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the insufficient visual distinction of homoglyphs. The vulnerability description and CVE reference links clearly point to this weakness, with explicit mention of IDN homograph attacks. The ability to register with a visually similar name and potentially trick an admin into granting privileges is a direct consequence of this weakness.\n\nCWE-289 and CWE-1390 are secondary because they represent potential impacts of the homograph attack. While authentication bypass is a concern, it is contingent on the successful exploitation of CWE-1007.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1007 as the primary CWE is based on the strong evidence provided in the vulnerability description and CVE reference links, as well as its base-level abstraction, which provides a more specific and accurate representation of the weakness compared to higher-level CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
