CWE-916 is related as the **weakness** of the password hashes, which contributed to the overall **weakness**. CWE-259 is a ChildOf CWE-798 which is a ChildOf CWE-1391.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    \n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe259 primary\n    class cwe916 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause** of **hard-coded credentials** (CWE-259). These **hard-coded credentials** used **weak passwords**, leading to CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort). The impact is unauthorized access to the device.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a high confidence level due to strong evidence directly linking the vulnerability to **hard-coded credentials** and **weak password** hashes. The selection of CWE-259 is based on the specific instance of hard-coded *passwords*, as indicated in the vulnerability description: \"D-Link DVG-3104MS version 1.0.2.0.3, 1.0.2.0.4, and 1.0.2.0.4E contains **hard-coded credentials** for undocumented user accounts in the /etc/passwd file. As **weak passwords** have been used, the plaintext passwords can be recovered from the hash values.\"\n\nCWE-916 is included because the **weakness** of the password hashes directly contributed to the vulnerability's exploitability.
