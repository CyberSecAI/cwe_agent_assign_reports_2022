| CWE-916 | Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-259, a **Variant** of CWE-798 (**Base**), indicating a specific type of hard-coded credential usage: a password. CWE-916 is related as the **weakness** of the password hashes, which contributed to the overall **weakness**. CWE-259 is a ChildOf CWE-798 which is a ChildOf CWE-1391.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause** of **hard-coded credentials** (CWE-259). These **hard-coded credentials** used **weak passwords**, leading to CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort). The impact is unauthorized access to the device.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis indicates a high confidence level due to strong evidence directly linking the vulnerability to **hard-coded credentials** and **weak password** hashes. The selection of CWE-259 is based on the specific instance of hard-coded *passwords*, as indicated in the vulnerability description: "D-Link DVG-3104MS version 1.0.2.0.3, 1.0.2.0.4, and 1.0.2.0.4E contains **hard-coded credentials** for undocumented user accounts in the /etc/passwd file. As **weak passwords** have been used, the plaintext passwords can be recovered from the hash values."

CWE-916 is included because the **weakness** of the password hashes directly contributed to the vulnerability's exploitability. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section states: "Weak password hashes that could be cracked using dictionary attacks".

Other CWEs considered but not used:

*   CWE-798: While the vulnerability involves **hard-coded credentials**, CWE-259 is a more specific variant focusing on passwords.
*   CWE-1391: This is a Class-level CWE, and more specific Base/Variant level CWEs exist.
*   CWE-321: This CWE focuses on cryptographic keys, not passwords.
*   CWE-1393, CWE-1392: These CWEs relate to *default* credentials, whereas the provided information indicates *hard-coded* credentials.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users. In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders. If a system administrator can recover a password directly, or use a brute force search on the available information, the administrator can use the password on other accounts.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1393: Use of Default Password
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses default passwords for potentially critical functionality.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 7086.55
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.
