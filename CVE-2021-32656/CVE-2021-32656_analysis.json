CWE-668 (Class) is considered as a secondary candidate, indicating a resource being exposed to the wrong sphere.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the **root cause**: Nextcloud **supports sharing registered users with other Nextcloud servers**. This leads to the vulnerability where an attacker can access a public link and **gain access to basic information about users** (impact). Thus, the chain is: **Sharing registered users** -> **Access to public link** -> **Information Disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-201 because the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicate that an attacker can **gain access to basic information about users** by accessing a public link. This perfectly aligns with the definition of CWE-201, where sensitive information is included in sent data. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states that the attacker can gain access to basic user information from the target Nextcloud server.\n\nThe evidence is derived from the following excerpts:\n\n*   Vulnerability Description: \"An attacker can **gain access to basic information about users** of a server by accessing a public link\"\n*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"By triggering this exchange, the attacker can **gain access to basic user information** from the target Nextcloud server.\"\n\nCWE-668 was considered because the vulnerability leads to unauthorized access to user information, which can be seen as exposing a resource (user information) to the wrong sphere. However, CWE-201 is more specific to the actual mechanism of the vulnerability, which is the inclusion of sensitive information in the data sent when a federated share is accessed.\n\nThe selection of CWE-201 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the vulnerability mechanism. The confidence level is high (0.9) due to the explicit evidence supporting the mapping.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
