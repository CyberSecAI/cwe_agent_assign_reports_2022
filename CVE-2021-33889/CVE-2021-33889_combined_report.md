# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is a stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121), which is a variant of the more general out-of-bounds write (CWE-787), which in turn is a specialization of improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer (CWE-119). The root cause stems from an inconsistency in how the `metric_len` variable is defined across different source files. It is treated as an `unsigned short` in one place and an `unsigned int` in another. This type mismatch during conversion (CWE-681) directly leads to the buffer overflow because the code writes more data than the allocated buffer size. This also involves improper handling of length parameter (CWE-130) because the length used for writing is different than the buffer allocated.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **inconsistency in integer data type for metric_len**. This **type mismatch** (CWE-681 and CWE-130) then leads to a **stack-based buffer overflow** (CWE-121). The final impact could be code execution or denial of service.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment clearly points to a **stack-based buffer overflow** (CWE-121) due to a type mismatch. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **stack-based buffer overflow** and an **inconsistency in the integer data type for metric_len.**

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides strong evidence:
*   "The vulnerability stems from an **inconsistency in how the `metric_len` variable is defined** and used...`metric_len` is defined as `unsigned short`. However...it's treated as an `unsigned int`. This mismatch leads to a buffer overflow."
*   "The core vulnerability is a **stack-based buffer overflow**. When writing to `metric_len`, the code uses the size of an `unsigned int` (larger) while the allocated buffer on the stack is for an `unsigned short` (smaller). This causes a write beyond the bounds of the allocated stack memory"

CWE-121 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. CWE-130 (Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency) and CWE-681 (Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types) are contributing factors, but the primary issue is the resulting buffer overflow on the stack.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.82
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.
**NOT USED:** This CWE does not apply as there is no subtraction occurring.

## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.
**NOT USED:** This CWE does not apply because the type conversion causes an overflow, not a truncation. The data written is larger than the allocated space.

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.
**NOT USED:** While a buffer overflow occurs, the root cause isn't an explicit incorrect calculation of buffer size, but a type mismatch.

## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
When converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.
**USED:** This CWE is relevant because the inconsistency in the integer data type for `metric_len` across different source files caused the overflow.

## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.
**NOT USED:** This CWE does not apply because there is an overwrite of memory after the allocated buffer, not before.

## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.
**NOT USED:** While the buffer access uses an incorrect length, the root cause is the type mismatch (CWE-681).

## CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation to determine how much memory to allocate, but an integer overflow can occur that causes less memory to be allocated than expected, leading to a buffer overflow.
**NOT USED:** This is a compound CWE and not appropriate because there isn't a calculation that leads to the overflow, but a type conversion issue.

## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value.
**NOT USED:** There isn't an integer overflow in the sense that a value becomes too large for its type, but a type conversion that leads to writing more data than allocated.

## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.
**USED:** This CWE is applicable because the different sizes of the `metric_len` variable (unsigned short vs. unsigned int) represent an inconsistency in the length parameter.

## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.
**NOT USED:** This is an over-write, not an over-read.

## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6844.12
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value.
**NOT USED:** This CWE

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-33889

## Vulnerability Description
OpenThread wpantund through 2021-07-02 has a stack-based Buffer Overflow because of an inconsistency in the integer data type for metric_len.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **inconsistency in integer data type for metric_len**
- **weakness:** **stack-based buffer overflow**
- **product:** OpenThread wpantund
- **version:** through 2021-07-02

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33889:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an inconsistency in how the `metric_len` variable is defined and used. In `src/ncp-spinel/SpinelNCPInstance.cpp`, `metric_len` is defined as `unsigned short`. However, in `third_party/openthread/src/ncp/spinel.c`, it's treated as an `unsigned int`. This mismatch leads to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. When writing to `metric_len`, the code uses the size of an `unsigned int` (larger) while the allocated buffer on the stack is for an `unsigned short` (smaller). This causes a write beyond the bounds of the allocated stack memory, which can overwrite adjacent data on the stack.
*   **Type Mismatch:** The inconsistency in data type definition for `metric_len` across different source files is the root cause that leads to the buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** The overflow could potentially allow an attacker to overwrite critical data on the stack including return addresses. This could lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Even if code execution isn't achieved, a buffer overflow could still lead to a crash and thus, a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by an attacker who can send specific link metrics related requests to the device through the wpantund interface.
*   The exact commands or sequence to trigger this is not specified, but involves interaction with the link metrics functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Device Access:** An attacker needs to have some level of access to the device running the vulnerable `wpantund` software. This might involve physical access or access via a network interface exposed by the device.
*   **Ability to Send Malicious Link Metric Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted link metrics queries or probes that cause a larger value to be written to the `metric_len` field which is treated as unsigned int when reading and unsigned short when written.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in `wpantund` versions from commit `4ae4619` to `bf45115` (inclusive).
*   The fix is available in commit `2b6f6c54bba3ab397f0e83f9d5e9faee905ac559`.

This is a moderate severity issue due to the possibility of remote code execution or DoS, but it has low exploitability as it requires access to the device.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-118
ChildOf -> CWE-20

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist




## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Overflow: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
Wraparound: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
wrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of "wraparound"

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with "overflow," "underflow," and "wraparound" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called "underflows").


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.

**[Terminology]** 

"Integer overflow" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.


A "wraparound" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.


"Overflow" is sometimes conflated with "wraparound" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.


The "overflow" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use "overflow" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using "underflow" for exceeding the minimum.


Some people use "overflow" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses "underflow" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.


See [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.


**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.




## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.

### Extended Description
If an attacker can manipulate the length parameter associated with an input such that it is inconsistent with the actual length of the input, this can be leveraged to cause the target application to behave in unexpected, and possibly, malicious ways. One of the possible motives for doing so is to pass in arbitrarily large input to the application. Another possible motivation is the modification of application state by including invalid data for subsequent properties of the application. Such weaknesses commonly lead to attacks such as buffer overflows and execution of arbitrary code.

### Alternative Terms
length manipulation
length tampering

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-240
ChildOf -> CWE-119
ChildOf -> CWE-119
CanPrecede -> CWE-805

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This probably overlaps other categories including zero-length issues.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2299:** Web application firewall consumes excessive memory when an HTTP request contains a large Content-Length value but no POST data.
- **CVE-2001-0825:** Buffer overflow in internal string handling routine allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a length argument of zero or less, which disables the length check.




## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Overflow: "Stack Overflow" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-788
ChildOf -> CWE-787

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Stack-based buffer overflows can instantiate in return address overwrites, stack pointer overwrites or frame pointer overwrites. They can also be considered function pointer overwrites, array indexer overwrites or write-what-where condition, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-35395:** Stack-based buffer overflows in SFK for wifi chipset used for IoT/embedded devices, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-2639:** Chain: integer coercion error (CWE-192) prevents a return value from indicating an error, leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)




## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

### Extended Description
This can happen in signed and unsigned cases.

### Alternative Terms
Integer underflow: 

"Integer underflow" is sometimes used to identify signedness errors in which an originally positive number becomes negative as a result of subtraction. However, there are cases of bad subtraction in which unsigned integers are involved, so it's not always a signedness issue.


"Integer underflow" is occasionally used to describe array index errors in which the index is negative.

- **CVE-2004-1002:** Integer underflow by packet with invalid length.
- **CVE-2005-0199:** Long input causes incorrect length calculation.




## CWE-128: Wrap-around Error
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Wrap around errors occur whenever a value is incremented past the maximum value for its type and therefore "wraps around" to a very small, negative, or undefined value.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** The relationship between overflow and wrap-around needs to be examined more closely, since several entries (including CWE-190) are closely related.






## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when a pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used.

### Alternative Terms
buffer underrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer underrun". "Buffer underflow" is more commonly used, although both terms are also sometimes used to describe a buffer under-read (CWE-127).

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This could be resultant from several errors, including a bad offset or an array index that decrements before the beginning of the buffer (see CWE-129).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-24018:** buffer underwrite in firmware verification routine allows code execution via a crafted firmware image
- **CVE-2002-2227:** Unchecked length of SSLv2 challenge value leads to buffer underflow.
- **CVE-2007-4580:** Buffer underflow from a small size value with a large buffer (length parameter inconsistency, CWE-130)




## CWE-786: Access of Memory Location Before Start of Buffer
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when a pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-119
ChildOf -> CWE-119
ChildOf -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available. It also overlaps existing CWE entries and might be deprecated in the future.
**Comments:** If the "Access" operation is known to be a read or a write, then investigate children of entries such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write and CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read.
**Reasons:**
- Potential Deprecation
- Frequent Misuse



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-2227:** Unchecked length of SSLv2 challenge value leads to buffer underflow.
- **CVE-2007-4580:** Buffer underflow from a small size value with a large buffer (length parameter inconsistency, CWE-130)
- **CVE-2007-1584:** Buffer underflow from an all-whitespace string, which causes a counter to be decremented before the buffer while looking for a non-whitespace character.




## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.

### Extended Description
When a primitive is cast to a smaller primitive, the high order bits of the large value are lost in the conversion, potentially resulting in an unexpected value that is not equal to the original value. This value may be required as an index into a buffer, a loop iterator, or simply necessary state data. In any case, the value cannot be trusted and the system will be in an undefined state. While this method may be employed viably to isolate the low bits of a value, this usage is rare, and truncation usually implies that an implementation error has occurred.

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Research Gap]** This weakness has traditionally been under-studied and under-reported, although vulnerabilities in popular software have been published in 2008 and 2009.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-17087:** Chain: integer truncation (CWE-197) causes small buffer allocation (CWE-131) leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in kernel pool, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-0231:** Integer truncation of length value leads to heap-based buffer overflow.
- **CVE-2008-3282:** Size of a particular type changes for 64-bit platforms, leading to an integer truncation in document processor causes incorrect index to be generated.
