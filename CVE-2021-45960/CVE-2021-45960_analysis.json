This can lead to other issues, such as CWE-789 **(Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value)** if the overflowed value is then used to allocate memory. CWE-190 is a child of CWE-682 **(Incorrect Calculation)**, indicating a general category of calculation errors.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe682[\"CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation\"]\n    \n    cwe190 -->|CHILDOF| cwe682\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe476\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe789,cwe682 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) due to a left shift operation. This leads to incorrect memory allocation (potentially CWE-789). The incorrect memory allocation can lead to realloc misbehavior, such as allocating too few bytes or only freeing memory, potentially causing denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several potential CWEs based on the vulnerability description, including those related to resource management, integer handling, and memory allocation. The final decision to focus on CWE-190 and CWE-789 stems from the root cause analysis in the CVE description, which clearly states that a **left shift operation** leads to an **integer overflow**, which then causes **incorrect memory allocation**.\n\nThe evidence from \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states:\n\"root_cause\": \"A left shift operation by 29 or more bits in the `storeAtts` function within `xmlparse.c` leads to an integer overflow, resulting in incorrect memory allocation by `realloc`.\"\n\nThis evidence directly supports the selection of CWE-190 as the primary weakness. The resulting incorrect memory allocation then leads to conditions described by CWE-789. The selection of these CWEs is at the appropriate level of specificity, as they directly address the root cause and immediate consequence of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
