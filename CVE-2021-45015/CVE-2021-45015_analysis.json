This CWE is a child of CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory) and CWE-706 (Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Pathname). The analysis focused on identifying the most specific CWE that directly describes the **root cause**, which is the failure to properly neutralize path traversal sequences. The hierarchical relationships confirm that CWE-23 is a more specific instance of a broader path traversal issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory\"]\n    cwe706[\"CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Pathname\"]\n\n    cwe23 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe23 -->|CHILDOF| cwe706\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe23 primary\n    class cwe22,cwe706 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper handling** of file paths, specifically the failure to neutralize \"..\" sequences. This leads directly to the ability to traverse directories and delete files outside the intended scope, resulting in arbitrary file deletion.\n\nRoot Cause: **Improper** or **missing** input validation of file paths\nWeakness: CWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal)\nImpact: Arbitrary file deletion\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on strong evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The key phrase \"does not properly filter or validate the file path and allows directory traversal using `../`\" directly supports the selection of CWE-23. The retriever results also listed CWE-23 as the top candidate.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-23 is based on its precise match with the vulnerability's **root cause**. It is at the base level of abstraction, providing sufficient specificity. The evidence clearly indicates that the application fails to properly handle relative path traversal sequences, allowing an attacker to delete arbitrary files. The CWE's description accurately reflects this scenario, making it the most appropriate classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-156: Improper Neutralization of Whitespace\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as whitespace when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
