It is a child of CWE-119. CWE-20 is a **Class** level weakness describing improper input validation, and it can precede CWE-119. The evidence clearly points to **improper input validation** as the root cause, leading to an out-of-bounds write, so these relationships support the chosen CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper input validation** (CWE-20) of a manipulated PSD file, which leads to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787), ultimately resulting in the application crashing.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the vulnerability description that highlights **improper input validation** as the root cause. The description states that a manipulated PSD file, received from untrusted sources, causes the application to crash due to **improper input validation**. This directly implies that the application is not correctly validating the structure or contents of the PSD file.\n\nThe provided evidence is sufficient to support the selection of CWE-787 as the primary CWE. The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section explicitly mentions **\"Improper Input Validation\"** as the root cause. The phrase \"**crashing of the application**\" suggests a memory corruption issue. The **CWE for similar CVE Descriptions** section lists CWE-787 as the primary match. All this evidence strongly supports assigning CWE-787 as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-20 is considered as a secondary CWE because the description mentions **Improper Input Validation** as the root cause but it is too general, and the actual **Out-of-bounds Write** is the more specific issue. While CWE-20 is a parent of CWE-119, which in turn is a parent of CWE-787, assigning CWE-787 is more appropriate because it directly reflects the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-787 accurately describes the out-of-bounds write, while CWE-20 acknowledges the role of **improper input validation** as a contributing factor, though it is more general.\n\n**CWE-119:** Considered but not used because while related, CWE-787 is a more specific child of CWE-119 and more accurately describes the vulnerability.\n**CWE-121:** Considered but not used because the description does not specify if it's stack-based.\n**CWE-126:** Considered but not used because the description highlights an out-of-bounds *write*, not a read.\n**CWE-1284:** Considered but not used because the specific quantity that is not validated isn't clear from the description.\n**CWE-190:** Considered but not used because there is no mention or indication of integer overflow or wraparound.\n**CWE-200:** Considered but not used because there is no indication of sensitive information being exposed.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
