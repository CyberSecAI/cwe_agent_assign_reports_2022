The application doesn't properly authorize which actors can invoke the handler using the custom URL scheme. |\n| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.6 | Pillar | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. A general category that applies because the app doesn't restrict access to the custom URL scheme handler, but CWE-939 is more specific. |\n| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE. The app is missing authorization for a critical function, but CWE-939 is more specific in this case. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE, CWE-939 (Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme), is a child of CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), which in turn is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). This hierarchical relationship indicates that CWE-939 is a more specific case of a missing authorization check. The selection of CWE-939 is influenced by its base-level abstraction, which provides more granularity than its parent classes, aligning well with the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe939[\"CWE-939: Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe939 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe939 primary\n    class cwe862,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses starts with the **improper access control** in the goo blog app, specifically the lack of authorization in the custom URL scheme handler. This leads to a remote attacker being able to redirect users to arbitrary websites, potentially for phishing attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **improper access control** in the goo blog app, leading to a consideration of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and its related children, including CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). However, the retriever results and vulnerability description both pointed towards a more specific weakness: the improper handling of custom URL schemes. The final decision was to map the vulnerability to CWE-939 (Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme) because it accurately reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the lack of authorization checks in the custom URL scheme handler. This is supported by the vulnerability description which states that the app \"**does not properly restrict access to the function that uses custom URL schemes**.\"\n\nThe hierarchical relationship of CWE-939 being a child of CWE-862 and CWE-284 helped refine the selection. While CWE-284 broadly applies, CWE-939 provides the necessary specificity for the identified weakness. The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary further strengthens this decision, confirming the improper restriction of custom URL schemes.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-939: Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.377\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a handler for a custom URL scheme, but it **does not properly restrict** which actors can invoke the handler using the scheme.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
