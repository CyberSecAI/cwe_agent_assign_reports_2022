CWE-126 is a variant of CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) and CWE-788 (Access of Memory Location After the End of a Buffer). The description mentions a \"**stack-based buffer over-read**\", indicating the read happens beyond the buffer's boundary. CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) is considered because the vulnerability description mentions \"recursion\".\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe788[\"CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After the End of a Buffer\"]\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n    cwe674 -->|ChildOf| cwe834\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe126 primary\n    class cwe674 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a huge request causing recursion, which leads to a **stack-based buffer over-read**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the \"**stack-based buffer over-read**\" and \"recursion\" aspects of the vulnerability description. The evidence from the vulnerability description key phrases directly supports the selection of CWE-126. While the CVE Reference Links Content Summary is unrelated, the vulnerability description itself provides sufficient information. The \"recursion\" aspect suggests CWE-674, but the primary issue is clearly the buffer over-read on the stack. Therefore, CWE-126 is the primary CWE, and CWE-674 is a secondary consideration.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-126: Buffer Over-read:** The vulnerability description states \"**stack-based buffer over-read**,\" which aligns directly with CWE-126's description: \"The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\"\n*   **CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion:** The vulnerability description mentions \"recursion,\" which is directly related to CWE-674: \"The product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place, consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\" This is a possible secondary factor as the recursion leads to the over-read.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow): While the issue is stack-based, the vulnerability is an over-read, not an overflow (write).\n*   CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input), CWE-1325 (Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation), CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value), CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime), CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), and CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error): These were considered but deemed less relevant than CWE-126 as they do not directly address the **buffer over-read** issue.",
