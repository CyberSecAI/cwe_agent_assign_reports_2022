CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is a high-level class with children like CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) is also related as it involves incorrect permission settings. The choice between these depends on the specific flaw.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe732 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe862,cwe863,cwe732 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe chain involves an **insecure permission** configuration leading to **information disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nInitially, the assessment focused on the **insecure permissions** that allow low-privilege users to query sensitive information. The primary concern is that the system **does not properly authorize** access to the `Orion.UserSettings` entity, leading to unauthorized enumeration of users and their settings.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"It has been reported that any Orion user, e.g. guest accounts can query the Orion.UserSettings entity and enumerate users and their basic settings.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary says: \"The vulnerability stems from **insecure permissions** that allow low-privilege Orion users to query the `Orion.UserSettings` SWIS entity\" and \"**Insecure Permissions:** Low-privilege users should not have access to the `Orion.UserSettings` SWIS entity.\"\n\nThe initial high-level assessment points to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), as it broadly covers cases where authorization is not correctly performed. However, due to its high level, it is discouraged. The next step is to consider its children for a more specific classification.\n\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is considered but doesn't fully capture the scenario, since some level of access is granted, but it's not properly restricted.\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) seems more appropriate since the authorization check is performed, but it's flawed, allowing low-privilege users access to sensitive data.\nCWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) is also a strong candidate as the root cause is related to the **insecure permissions** assigned to the `Orion.UserSettings` entity.\n\nUltimately, I'm sticking with CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) as the primary due to its alignment with the broader issue of flawed authorization, and due to the lack of more detailed information to pinpoint the exact nature of the flaw (incorrect check vs. missing check) between CWE-862 and CWE-863. All three candidates are added as secondary mappings, due to their relevance to the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n*Not Selected:* Not relevant since the vulnerability is not related to injection.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
