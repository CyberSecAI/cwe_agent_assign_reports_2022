This CWE is a child of CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**) and CWE-284 (**Improper Access Control**). While CWE-285 might seem applicable, CWE-863 is more specific as it highlights that an authorization check *is* performed but is done incorrectly, aligning precisely with the vulnerability description. CWE-639 (**Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**) was also considered but deemed less appropriate because the vulnerability isn't explicitly tied to a user-controlled key, but more broadly to an incorrect authorization process.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    cwe639 -->|ChildOf| cwe863\n    cwe639 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe639 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper authorization** mechanism in GitLab, leading to guest users in private projects being able to view CI/CD analytics, which they should not have access to.\n  - Root Cause: **Improper authorization**\n  - Weakness: Incorrect Access Control, Insufficient Permission Checks\n  - Impact: Guest users can view CI/CD analytics, potentially exposing sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Improper authorization**\" as the root cause, and the CVE summary elaborates that the **vulnerability is due to a permission issue where guest users in private projects were able to view CI/CD analytics**.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the hierarchical structure of access control-related CWEs. Choosing CWE-863 provides a more accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability compared to its parent CWE-285.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-863 directly addresses the incorrect authorization check, which is the core issue. While CWE-285 could also apply, it's less specific. CWE-639 is not specific enough because the vulnerability isn't explicitly related to manipulating a user-controlled key. The evidence explicitly points to an authorization check being performed, but being done incorrectly.\n\nCWE-284 was considered but not chosen as it is too high-level (Pillar) and the MITRE mapping guidance discourages its use.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-282: Improper Ownership Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product assigns the wrong ownership, or does not properly verify the ownership, of an object or resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-708: Incorrect Ownership Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product assigns an owner to a resource, but the owner is outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
