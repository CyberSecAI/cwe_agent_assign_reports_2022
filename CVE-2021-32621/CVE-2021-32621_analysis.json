While CWE-74 (Class) is a parent, CWE-1336 provides more specific details relevant to the vulnerability's root cause. CWE-862 (Class) is a secondary CWE as the gadget title was not checked for proper authorization checks. There isn't a direct hierarchical relationship between CWE-1336 and CWE-862, but they are related in the context of how the vulnerability manifested.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe1336 -->|PEEROF| cwe917\n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe74 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe94\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1336 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n    class cwe94,cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper authorization** checks, leading to the **improper neutralization** of special elements within the Velocity template engine. This then results in the ability to **execute script requiring privileges** and ultimately achieve remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which highlights the **root cause** as stemming from the improper handling of Velocity template code within dashboard gadgets' titles. The XWiki platform was evaluating Velocity code without proper authorization checks.\nThe vulnerability's details closely match CWE-1336, as the gadget titles were susceptible to injection of Velocity code that was then executed server-side. This is further supported by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", specifically: \"The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of Velocity template code within the titles of dashboard gadgets. Specifically, the XWiki platform was evaluating Velocity code in gadget titles without proper authorization checks.\"\n\nCWE-1336 is selected because the evidence explicitly mentions a template engine (Velocity) and the **improper neutralization** of special elements or syntax within it. This aligns perfectly with the CWE's description: \"The product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.\"\n\nCWE-862 is also relevant because the system **fails to verify** if the user has the necessary script or programming rights before processing the Velocity code in the gadget title.\n\nCWE-74 was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because it is a Class-level CWE and less specific than CWE-1336, which directly addresses template engine vulnerabilities.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
