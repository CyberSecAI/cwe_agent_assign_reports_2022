CWE-401 is a variant of CWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release), and the description directly aligns with the **memory leak** described in the vulnerability. CWE-476 is also present because the CVE Reference mentions a NULL pointer dereference.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    \n    cwe401 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe401 primary\n    class cwe404,cwe476 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a crafted input leading to a **memory leak**.\n\n1.  Crafted DWG Input\n2.  **Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime** (CWE-401)\n3.  (Possibly) NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476), leading to program crash.\n4.
