## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure authentication** mechanism that **relies on user-supplied 'col' and 'openid' parameters without proper validation**. This leads to an **authentication bypass**, allowing an **attacker to gain privileges** and potentially access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment considered several CWEs related to authentication and input validation. The primary weakness is the authentication bypass, where the application **incorrectly authenticates users based on the 'col' and 'openid' parameters without proper validation.** The evidence supporting this includes the vulnerability description stating that an **attacker can log in through the /index.php/user/login endpoint using the 'col' and 'openid' parameters to gain privileges**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further emphasizes that the application **trusts user-supplied 'col' and 'openid' parameters without proper validation or sanitization**.

CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) is the most appropriate primary CWE because it specifically addresses the scenario where authentication can be bypassed through an alternate path or channel, which aligns with the vulnerability description where the `col` and `openid` parameters act as an alternate, unprotected authentication mechanism.

CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is considered a secondary CWE because it is a more general class that describes cases where authentication is insufficient. While relevant, it is not as specific as CWE-288. The mapping guidance for CWE-287 discourages its use when lower-level CWEs are applicable, reinforcing the choice of CWE-288 as the primary CWE.

CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) is also considered a secondary CWE as it describes a scenario where the authentication mechanism is weak but not necessarily bypassed. The vulnerability in question allows for a complete bypass, making CWE-288 more accurate.

The selection of CWE-288 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it directly captures the essence of the authentication bypass vulnerability. Higher-level CWEs like CWE-287 and CWE-1390 are less specific and do not fully represent the vulnerability's nature.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-45786

## Vulnerability Description
In maccms v10, an attacker can log in through /index.php/user/login in the col and openid parameters to gain privileges.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** gain privileges
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** maccms
- **version:** v10
- **component:** /index.php/user/login in the col and openid parameters

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the user login functionality of the application, where it allows authentication using the `col` and `openid` parameters, in addition to the conventional username and password. Critically, these two parameters are fully user-controllable, leading to arbitrary user login.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Authentication:** The application trusts user-supplied `col` and `openid` parameters for authentication without proper validation or sanitization.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The login process does not validate that the provided `col` and `openid` parameters correspond to a valid user, allowing attackers to bypass the intended authentication mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary User Login:** An attacker can log in as any user without knowing their password by manipulating the `col` and `openid` parameters.
- **Full Account Access:** This allows an attacker to gain complete access to the target user's account, potentially leading to data theft, unauthorized actions, and further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/index.php/user/login` endpoint.
- **Malicious Parameter Injection:** The attacker injects arbitrary values for the `openid` and `col` parameters. For example `openid=1&col=user_id`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application.
- **Understanding of the Login Mechanism:** The attacker needs to know that the application uses the mentioned parameters for authentication
- **Ability to send HTTP POST requests:** The attacker needs the capability to send POST requests to the login URL with the vulnerable parameters.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) request demonstrating how to exploit this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has been acknowledged and fixed by the project maintainer.

## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).




## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

### Extended Description


If a web product does not properly protect assumed-immutable values from modification in hidden form fields, parameters, cookies, or URLs, this can lead to modification of critical data. Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.


For example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.

## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-306
ChildOf -> CWE-284
PeerOf -> CWE-420

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** overlaps Unprotected Alternate Channel



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2000-1179:** Router allows remote attackers to read system logs without authentication by directly connecting to the login screen and typing certain control characters.
- **CVE-1999-1454:** Attackers with physical access to the machine may bypass the password prompt by pressing the ESC (Escape) key.
- **CVE-1999-1077:** OS allows local attackers to bypass the password protection of idled sessions via the programmer's switch or CMD-PWR keyboard sequence, which brings up a debugger that the attacker can use to disable the lock.




## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
According to WASC, "Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization."

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-672
ChildOf -> CWE-672
CanPrecede -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2017-9615:** verbose logging stores admin credentials in a world-readable log file
- **CVE-2018-1999036:** SSH password for private key stored in build log




## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.

### Alternative Terms
None

ChildOf -> CWE-522

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.




## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description
Most languages and protocols have their own special elements such as characters and reserved words. These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < ("less than") as meaning "read input from a file".

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-707

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness can be related to interpretation conflicts or interaction errors in intermediaries (such as proxies or application firewalls) when the intermediary's model of an endpoint does not account for protocol-specific special elements.

**[Relationship]** See this entry's children for different types of special elements that have been observed at one point or another. However, it can be difficult to find suitable CVE examples. In an attempt to be complete, CWE includes some types that do not have any associated observed example.

**[Research Gap]** This weakness is probably under-studied for proprietary or custom formats. It is likely that these issues are fairly common in applications that use their own custom format for configuration files, logs, meta-data, messaging, etc. They would only be found by accident or with a focused effort based on an understanding of the format.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-0677:** Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.
- **CVE-2000-0703:** Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.
- **CVE-2003-0020:** Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.
