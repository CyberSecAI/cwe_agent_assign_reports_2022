The vulnerability description states \"**predictable anti-CSRF token generation**\" which directly aligns with this CWE. |\n| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 0.7 | Compound | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The **impact** of the predictable token is that it \"**might allow CSRF attacks**\". |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **generation of predictable numbers or identifiers** (CWE-340). The **impact** is that this weakness allows **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** attacks (CWE-352).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe340[\"CWE-340: Generation of Predictable Numbers or Identifiers\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe340\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe340 primary\n    class cwe352 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is:\n1.  **Root Cause**: CWE-340: **Generation of Predictable Numbers or Identifiers**.\n2.  **Impact**: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks are made possible.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **rootcause** as a **predictable anti-CSRF token generation** which might allow CSRF attacks.\nThe retriever results suggested CWE-340, CWE-352 and others.\nCWE-340 (Generation of Predictable Numbers or Identifiers) is a Class-level CWE, while its description precisely matches the **root cause** in the vulnerability description. The mapping guidance suggests reviewing its children for a better fit, but none of them are more appropriate.\nCWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)) is a Compound-level CWE that represents the **impact** of the vulnerability.\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-352 REQUIRES CWE-340 (or other weaknesses) to occur. Therefore, both CWEs are relevant, with CWE-340 as the primary weakness and CWE-352 as the secondary impact.\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-340 being a Class and CWE-352 being a Compound.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
