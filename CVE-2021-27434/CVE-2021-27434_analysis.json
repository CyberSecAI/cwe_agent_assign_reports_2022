CWE-400 **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** is a parent of CWE-770 **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**, and CWE-789 **Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value** is a variant of CWE-770. The vulnerability leads to a stack overflow which is a form of resource exhaustion. Therefore, the hierarchical relationship between these CWEs helps to understand the potential progression and impact of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n\n    cwe674 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe674 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe789,cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **uncontrolled recursion** (CWE-674), leading to **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400) and potentially triggering a **stack overflow** because of **memory allocation with excessive size value** (CWE-789).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **uncontrolled recursion** as the main **weakness** causing a stack overflow, which aligns with CWE-674. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"***uncontrolled recursion***, which may allow an attacker to trigger a stack overflow.\" The reference links also confirm that the vulnerability involves issues in how the .NET Framework handles file access. The retriever results also showed that CWE-674 is a good match.\n\nCWE-674 is a Class-level CWE, and the mapping guidance recommends reviewing children to find a more specific fit if available, but no children were present. CWE-674's description matches the vulnerability well: \"The product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place, consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\"\n\nCWE-400 **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** was considered because stack overflow is a form of resource exhaustion. While CWE-400 is applicable as an impact, it is discouraged because it is frequently misused, and a more precise mapping is available. The child CWE-770, **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**, is more specific, and CWE-789 **Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value** is an even more specific variant. I'm including CWE-400 and CWE-789 as a secondary option because it explains the consequences of the uncontrolled recursion.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\n**Abstraction:** Class\nThe product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction:** Class\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction:** Variant\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.",
