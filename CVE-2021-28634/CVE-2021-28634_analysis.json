CWE-78 is child of CWE-77 and CWE-74. CWE-78 can also be CWE-88.

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this, stating the **\"Root cause of vulnerability: OS Command Injection\"** and the **\"vulnerability is caused by the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied data before using it in a shell command. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the executed shell command.\"** This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-78 **[CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')]**, which is at the Base level of abstraction and is the preferred level. CWE-78 is also the top CWE match in the Retriever Results. I am not choosing CWE-20 **[CWE-20: Improper Input Validation]** because it is a class and too general, and CWE-78 is a child of CWE-20. I am not choosing CWE-787 **[CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write]** because the vulnerability is about command injection, not memory corruption. I am not choosing CWE-367 **[CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition]** because the vulnerability is not about race conditions.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-78 **[CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')]**",
