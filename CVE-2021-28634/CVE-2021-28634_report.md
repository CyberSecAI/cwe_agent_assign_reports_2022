## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-78 **[CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')]**, which is a base CWE. CWE-78 is child of CWE-77 and CWE-74. CWE-78 can also be CWE-88. The abstraction level is base.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of special elements** leading to OS Command Injection, which results in arbitrary code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which clearly states that the vulnerability is due to an **"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command"**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this, stating the **"Root cause of vulnerability: OS Command Injection"** and the **"vulnerability is caused by the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied data before using it in a shell command. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the executed shell command."** This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-78 **[CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')]**, which is at the Base level of abstraction and is the preferred level. CWE-78 is also the top CWE match in the Retriever Results. I am not choosing CWE-20 **[CWE-20: Improper Input Validation]** because it is a class and too general, and CWE-78 is a child of CWE-20. I am not choosing CWE-787 **[CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write]** because the vulnerability is about command injection, not memory corruption. I am not choosing CWE-367 **[CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition]** because the vulnerability is not about race conditions.

Relevant CWE Information:
