CWE-407 is, in turn, a child of CWE-405 (Class), which is a child of CWE-400 (Class). This indicates a hierarchical relationship where the specific issue of inefficient regular expression complexity leads to broader resource consumption problems.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    cwe405[\"CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe407 -->|CHILDOF| cwe405\n    cwe405 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407,cwe405,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a crafted URL containing many \"@\" characters. This input triggers **catastrophic backtracking** in the regular expression used for parsing the authority component of the URL (**CWE-1333**). The **catastrophic backtracking** leads to excessive CPU consumption, resulting in a denial-of-service condition (**CWE-400**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-1333, \"Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity,\" because the root cause of the vulnerability is **catastrophic backtracking** in a regular expression. This aligns directly with the CWE description and observed examples. The vulnerability description and CVE reference explicitly mention the use of a regular expression that exhibits **catastrophic backtracking** when parsing URLs with many \"@\" characters. This leads to excessive resource consumption and denial of service.\n\nEvidence:\n\n*   \"When provided with a URL containing many @ characters in the authority component, the authority regular expression exhibits **catastrophic backtracking**, causing a denial of service\"\n*   \"The vulnerability is due to a regular expression used for parsing the authority component of a URL, which exhibits catastrophic backtracking when provided with a URL containing many `@` characters.\"\n*   \"An attacker can cause a denial of service condition by providing a crafted URL with many `@` characters, leading to excessive resource consumption by the vulnerable parser.\"\n\nCWE-400, \"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')\" was considered as a secondary CWE because the **catastrophic backtracking** directly leads to a denial-of-service condition, which is a form of resource exhaustion. The relationship between CWE-1333 and CWE-400 is that the inefficient regular expression complexity causes uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1333 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability (inefficient regular expression). While CWE-400 describes the impact (denial of service), CWE-1333 explains why and how the denial of service occurs.\nThe high retriever score for CWE-1333 supports the decision.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1.000\n**Source**: alternate_terms\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Observed Examples:**\n- **CVE-2020-5243:** server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.\n- **CVE-2021-21317:** npm package for user-agent parser prone to ReDoS due to overlapping capture groups\n- **CVE-2019-16215:** Markdown parser uses inefficient regex when processing a message, allowing users to cause CPU consumption and delay preventing processing of other messages.\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the consumption of resources, which can lead to denial of service, degraded performance, or other unintended consequences.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n- Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit.",
