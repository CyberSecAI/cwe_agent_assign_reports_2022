CWE-366 is a base-level CWE, a child of CWE-362, which is a more general class. The **memory corruption** consequence could indicate an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787), which is a common result of data races and memory corruption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe366[\"CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    \n    cwe366 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe787 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe366\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe366 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unconditional implementation of Sync for Intern**, leading to a **data race**, and potentially resulting in **memory corruption**.\n- The root cause is the improper implementation of Sync.\n- The weakness is the resulting **data race**.\n- The impact is **memory corruption**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the provided evidence that indicated the **root cause** as the **unconditional implementation of Sync for Intern** and the **weakness** as a **data race**. The retriever results favored CWE-366 and CWE-362, both related to race conditions.\n\nThe final decision is to assign CWE-366 as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the identified **data race** within a thread, aligning with the base-level abstraction preference. CWE-787 is a possible secondary CWE due to the **memory corruption** impact, but the evidence more strongly supports the **data race** as the primary issue. The graph relationships influenced the decision by showing how CWE-366 relates to the more general CWE-362 and how it can potentially lead to CWE-787. The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-366 being a base-level CWE and more specific than the class-level CWE-362.\n\nThe evidence is \"The `Intern<T>` type in the `internment` crate unconditionally implemented the `Sync` trait, even when the underlying type `T` did not implement `Sync`.\" This led to \"data races on `T` when `T` is not `Sync`.\" and \"Data races lead to undefined behavior\" and ultimately \"memory corruption\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 3.30\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-825\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-824\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-823\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-822\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-124\n\n**Explanation of Selected CWEs:**\n\n*   **CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread**\n    *   The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **data race**, which aligns perfectly with the definition of a race condition. The **unconditional implementation of Sync for Intern** allows concurrent access to the `Intern` struct, leading to the race condition.\n    *   A race condition can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashes, deadlocks, or data corruption.\n    *   This is a base-level CWE, providing a specific classification for the vulnerability.\n    *   The mapping guidance allows its use and confirms that it is at the base level of abstraction.\n*   **CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write**\n    *   The vulnerability's impact is **memory corruption**, which can be a consequence of an out-of-bounds write. The **data race** may result in writing data beyond the allocated buffer.\n    *   Out-of-bounds writes can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.\n    *   This is a base-level CWE.\n    *   The mapping guidance allows its use.\n\n**Explanation of Omitted CWEs:**\n\n*   **CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')**: This is a class-level CWE, and CWE-366 is a more specific child of this CWE.\n*   **CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource**: While memory corruption is mentioned, there's no direct evidence of using an uninitialized resource.\n*   **CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition**: This CWE involves checking the state of a resource before using it, which isn't explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n*   **CWE-188: Reliance on Data/Memory Layout**: This CWE is about incorrect assumptions about memory layout, which isn't the primary issue here.\n*   **CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition**: This CWE is more specific than what is described. The current description shows that we can cause memory corruption, but we don't know where and what can be written.\n*   **CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference**: There's no mention of null pointers in the description.\n*   **CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow**: It's possible that the memory corruption could be a heap-based buffer overflow, but there's no direct evidence.\n*   **CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read**: Similar to CWE-787, this could be a consequence, but the primary issue is the race condition.",
