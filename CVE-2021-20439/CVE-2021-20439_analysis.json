CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), making it a more specific classification. CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is also a related CWE as storing passwords in plaintext is a specific case of storing sensitive information in cleartext. This relationship suggests that while CWE-312 is relevant, CWE-256 provides a more precise characterization of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe312 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect storage of user credentials in plain clear text**. This **weakness** allows an unauthorized user to potentially read the credentials, leading to unauthorized access and other security impacts.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the most accurate CWE based on the vulnerability description, which clearly states that the product \"**stores user credentials in plain clear text**\". The retriever results suggested CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password), CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information), and CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) as potential candidates.\n\nCWE-256 was selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the specific issue of storing passwords in plaintext. This aligns with the principle of choosing the most specific CWE available. The evidence supporting this decision is the phrase \"**stores user credentials in plain clear text**\" from the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-312 was considered as a secondary CWE since storing passwords in plaintext is a form of storing sensitive information in cleartext. However, CWE-256 is more specific to the type of sensitive information involved.\n\nCWE-522 was also considered because it broadly covers insufficiently protected credentials. However, CWE-256 provides a more precise description of the storage **weakness**.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-256 is based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the hierarchical relationship analysis, which indicates that CWE-256 is a more specific child of CWE-522.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
