CWE-22 and CWE-73 are related but less specific. CWE-22 focuses on path traversal, while CWE-73 covers broader external control of file names or paths.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe98[\"CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')\"]\n    cwe706[\"CWE-706: Use of Multiple Resources that Don't Interact Well Together\"]\n    cwe829[\"CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    \n    cwe98 -->|CHILDOF| cwe706\n    cwe98 -->|CHILDOF| cwe829\n    cwe98 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe94\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe98\n    cwe22 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe73\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe98 primary\n    class cwe22,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with external control over the filename used in an include statement (CWE-73), which can lead to path traversal (CWE-22) if not properly sanitized, and ultimately results in remote file inclusion (CWE-98) and potential code execution (CWE-94).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **local file inclusion** vulnerability described. The primary CWE selected is CWE-98 because the **root cause** is the **improper control of the filename** used in the `include` statement. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-98.\n\nThe evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section strongly supports this: \"The vulnerability stems from the `cryptographp.inc.php` file directly including a file path provided by the user through the `cfg` GET parameter without proper sanitization or validation.\"\n\nCWE-22 and CWE-73 were considered as secondary CWEs. CWE-22 applies because path traversal can be used to exploit the file inclusion vulnerability. CWE-73 is relevant because the vulnerability involves external control over the file name or path.\n\nThe selection of CWE-98 as the primary CWE is based on its precise match to the vulnerability's root cause, as evidenced by the vulnerability description and supporting details. The abstraction level (Variant) is also appropriate, providing a specific classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
