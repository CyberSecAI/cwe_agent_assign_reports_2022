CWE-122 is also a child of CWE-787. This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-787 is more specific than CWE-119, and CWE-122 is a specific type of out-of-bounds write that occurs on the heap. The relationships influenced the decision to choose CWE-787 as the primary, given the description specified a heap-based buffer overflow and **improper bounds checking**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe122 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is: **improper bounds checking** leading to a **heap-based buffer overflow**, which can cause the server to crash.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **improper bounds checking** as the root cause and a **heap-based buffer overflow** as the weakness.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"**heap-based buffer overflow**, caused by **improper bounds checking**\". This aligns well with CWE-787, which describes an out-of-bounds write. The description also specifies that this occurs due to **improper bounds checking**, further supporting the selection of CWE-787. CWE-787 is a base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The retriever results also list CWE-787 as the primary match for similar CVE descriptions.\n\nCWE-122, Heap-based Buffer Overflow, was considered. Although the vulnerability is described as a heap-based buffer overflow, CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-787. Since the root cause is **improper bounds checking**, and the result is an out-of-bounds write, CWE-787 is the more appropriate choice. CWE-122 could be considered as a secondary CWE.\n\nCWE-119, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, was also considered. While this is a broader category that includes out-of-bounds writes, the description provides enough detail to select the more specific CWE-787. CWE-119 is a class level CWE, and the mapping guidance discourages its use when lower-level CWEs are available. CWE-119 is considered as a secondary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
