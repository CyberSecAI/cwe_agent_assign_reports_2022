The vulnerability is explicitly described as an out-of-bounds read. |\n| CWE-129 | Improper Validation of Array Index | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The root cause is the lack of validation of the array index. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-125 **Out-of-bounds Read**, which is a child of CWE-119 **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**. The secondary CWE is CWE-129 **Improper Validation of Array Index**, which is a child of CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation**. CWE-129 can precede CWE-119, as the improper validation of the array index leads to the out-of-bounds read.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe129[\"CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe129 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe129 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe129 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20) of the array index. This leads to **improper validation of the array index** (CWE-129), which ultimately results in an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125) and can lead to code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **out-of-bounds read** as the primary vulnerability based on the description. The description states, \"A specially crafted malformed file can lead to an **out-of-bounds read** and type confusion, which could lead to code execution.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause** is the lack of proper bounds checking when parsing Nef polygon data, leading to an out-of-bounds read in the `SNC_io_parser::read_facet()` function. The content states that \"The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the `SNC_io_parser::read_facet()` function, where the `fh->incident_volume()` member is set using an unchecked index from the input file (`Volume_of[index+addInfiBox]`). This allows an attacker to read arbitrary memory locations.\"\n\nThe retriever results also support this, with CWE-125 **Out-of-bounds Read** being a top match. The relationship analysis shows how the **improper validation of the array index** (CWE-129) leads to the out-of-bounds read. CWE-129 is included as it is the root cause that leads to the out-of-bounds read and is at a variant level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\nThe final selection of CWEs is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. CWE-125 **Out-of-bounds Read** accurately reflects the vulnerability, and CWE-129 **Improper Validation of Array Index** captures the **root cause**. The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-125 being a Base CWE and CWE-129 being a Variant CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
