This predictability is then exploited due to **incorrect access control** on the DeleteObjNow service. I am also including CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization, as a secondary CWE, because the access control check is not performed correctly. Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key (CWE-639) is included as a base CWE related to the authorization issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe340[\"CWE-340: Generation of Predictable Numbers or Identifiers\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe340 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe340 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **predictable node IDs** (CWE-340). This predictability allows an attacker to guess node IDs and then exploit the **incorrect access control** (CWE-863) on the DeleteObjNow service to delete nodes outside the attacker's perimeter. The root cause is the predictable node IDs.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-340, because the **predictable node IDs** is a key factor in enabling the exploit. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"node IDs are predictable (with incrementing numbers)\". The retriever results list CWE-340 as the highest-ranked CWE.\n\nI considered CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) as secondary CWEs, because the **incorrect access control** is what allows the attacker to exploit the predictable node IDs. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentions \"Broken access control. An authenticated user with node management rights for one group can delete nodes from a different group.\"\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-340 is a class-level CWE, but it directly addresses the issue of predictable identifiers. CWE-863 and CWE-639 address the authorization issues.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
