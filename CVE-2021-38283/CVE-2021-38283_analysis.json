CWE-200 is a class-level CWE, making CWE-532 a more specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe538\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe532\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a potential **missing authentication** (CWE-306), which allows an attacker to access a predictable URI. This leads to the **insertion of sensitive information into a log file** (CWE-532), which ultimately results in the **exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-532 as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description stating that remote attackers can read application log files containing sensitive information via a predictable /log URI. This aligns with CWE-532's description of a product writing sensitive information to a log file.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-532 is derived directly from the vulnerability description: \"Wipro Holmes Orchestrator 20.4.1 (20.4.1_02_11_2020) allows remote attackers to read application log files containing sensitive information via a predictable /log URI.\"\n\nCWE-200 was considered but is too broad, as it describes the exposure of sensitive information but doesn't specify the mechanism. Since the mechanism is **insertion of sensitive information into log files**, CWE-532 is more appropriate. While CWE-306 **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** could be part of the exploit chain, the primary weakness described is that sensitive information is placed into the log files and exposed via a predictable URI. Therefore, I have a high confidence that CWE-532 is the correct mapping.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
