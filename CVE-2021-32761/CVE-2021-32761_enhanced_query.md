# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-32761

# Vulnerability Description

    Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. A vulnerability involving **out-of-bounds read** and **integer overflow** to buffer overflow exists starting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 5.0.13, 6.0.15, and 6.2.5. On 32-bit systems, Redis `*BIT*` command are vulnerable to **integer overflow** that can potentially be exploited to corrupt the heap, leak arbitrary heap contents or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing specially crafted commands bit commands. This problem only affects Redis on 32-bit platforms, or compiled as a 32-bit binary. Redis versions 5.0.`3m 6.0.15, and 6.2.5 contain patches for this issue. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'integer overflow'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 1343.90)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 2. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Score: 1252.11)

The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 3. CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error (Score: 962.23)

Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion....
