# Analysis for CVE-2021-32761

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.9 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)**, as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions an **integer overflow** in the `*BIT*` commands. This can lead to **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)**, where the program reads data past the end of the intended buffer due to the incorrect calculation resulting from the integer overflow.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)** in the `*BIT*` commands of Redis on 32-bit systems. This **integer overflow** can lead to **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)**, which further results in heap corruption, leaking arbitrary heap contents, and potentially remote code execution.

Integer Overflow (CWE-190) -> Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125) -> Heap Corruption/Information Leak/Remote Code Execution

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions **integer overflow** and **out-of-bounds read**. The description states, "On 32-bit systems, Redis `*BIT*` command are vulnerable to **integer overflow** that can potentially be exploited to corrupt the heap, leak arbitrary heap contents or trigger remote code execution" and also mentions "**out-of-bounds read**".

The graph relationships show that **CWE-190** can precede **CWE-125**, indicating that the integer overflow is the root cause, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as they directly represent the **root causes** described in the vulnerability.

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-32761

# Vulnerability Description

    Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. A vulnerability involving **out-of-bounds read** and **integer overflow** to buffer overflow exists starting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 5.0.13, 6.0.15, and 6.2.5. On 32-bit systems, Redis `*BIT*` command are vulnerable to **integer overflow** that can potentially be exploited to corrupt the heap, leak arbitrary heap contents or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing specially crafted commands bit commands. This problem only affects Redis on 32-bit platforms, or compiled as a 32-bit binary. Redis versions 5.0.`3m 6.0.15, and 6.2.5 contain patches for this issue. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.
