# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-25095

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |
| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 1 | Compound | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is the **lack of authorization** in the AJAX action, which falls under CWE-862. The secondary weakness is the **lack of CSRF checks**, which is covered by CWE-352. CWE-862 is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), but CWE-862 is more specific and thus more appropriate. CWE-352 requires CWE-346 (Origin Validation), CWE-441 (Unintended Proxy or Intermediary), CWE-642 (External Control of Critical State Data), and CWE-613 (Insufficient Session Expiration) to be present.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of authorization** and **CSRF checks** in the `ip2location_country_blocker_save_rules` AJAX action. This allows any authenticated user (even a subscriber) to call the action and block arbitrary countries, preventing users from accessing the frontend.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability is primarily due to **missing authorization** in the AJAX action, which allows low-privileged users to perform administrative tasks. The vulnerability description key phrases highlight this: "**rootcause:** **lack of authorization and CSRF checks**" This directly relates to CWE-862. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: "The vulnerability stems from a **lack of proper authorization** and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks in the `ip2location_country_blocker_save_rules` AJAX action within the IP2Location Country Blocker plugin."

CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a more specific child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), making it a better fit than the more generic CWE-284. The retriever results list CWE-862 as a good candidate. The other vulnerability is a **missing CSRF check**. This directly relates to CWE-352. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: "**Missing CSRF Check:** The plugin does not implement CSRF protection, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks."

The graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the hierarchical structure and dependencies between CWEs. By choosing CWE-862 and CWE-352, the assessment is based on the evidence and provides the optimal level of specificity.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Reason for not selecting:* While related, this is not as direct as Missing Authorization.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Reason for not selecting:* This is not relevant to the described vulnerability.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Reason for not selecting:* This is not relevant to the described vulnerability.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Reason for not selecting:* This is not relevant to the described vulnerability.

## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Reason for not selecting:* This is not relevant to the described vulnerability.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Reason for not selecting:* This is not relevant to the described vulnerability.

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Reason for not selecting:* This is not relevant to the described vulnerability.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Reason for not selecting:* This is not relevant to the described vulnerability.

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This
