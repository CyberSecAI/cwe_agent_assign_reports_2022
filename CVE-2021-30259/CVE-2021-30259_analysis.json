CWE-1285 is a child of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) is included as a secondary CWE as the impact of the **improper validation** leads to an out-of-bounds read. CWE-126 is a variant and a child of CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) and CWE-788 (Access of Memory Location After the End of a Buffer).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1285[\"CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe788[\"CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After the End of a Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe1285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1285 primary\n    class cwe126 secondary\n    class cwe20,cwe125,cwe788 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper validation** (CWE-1285) of function table entries, leading to an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates a potential out-of-bounds access due to **improper validation** of function table entries. The description key phrases highlight the **rootcause** as **improper validation** and the impact as out-of-bounds access.\n\nBased on the provided information:\n\n*   The **rootcause** is **improper validation** of function table entries. This aligns with CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input), which describes scenarios where input specifying an index, position, or offset is not properly validated. The vulnerability description states \"**improper validation**\" as the root cause.\n*   The impact, out-of-bounds access, suggests that the **improper validation** leads to reading beyond the intended buffer. This aligns with CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read), where the product reads from a buffer using access mechanisms that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\nCWE-1285 is selected as the primary CWE because the description explicitly mentions **improper validation**. CWE-126 is included as a secondary CWE because it represents the direct consequence (out-of-bounds read) of the **improper validation**.\n\nThe retriever results list several other CWEs, but they are less directly relevant:\n\n*   CWE-1314 (Missing Write Protection for Parametric Data Values): This relates to missing write protection, which is not the primary issue described.\n*   CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset): While related to out-of-bounds access, the root cause here is the **improper validation**, not the pointer arithmetic itself.\n*   CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition): There's no mention of race conditions in the description.\n*   CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference): The provided description does not mention that the pointer comes from an untrusted source.\n*   CWE-781 (Improper Address Validation in IOCTL with METHOD_NEITHER I/O Control Code): It's specific to IOCTL and METHOD_NEITHER, which are not mentioned in the description.\n*   CWE-390 (Detection of Error Condition Without Action): The description doesn't indicate that an error condition is detected without any action.\n*   CWE-415 (Double Free): There's no mention of memory being freed twice.\n*   CWE-252 (Unchecked Return Value): There is no mention of return values being unchecked.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1285 and CWE-126 is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description, focusing on the **rootcause** (**improper validation**) and the resulting impact (out-of-bounds access). The abstraction levels (Base for CWE-1285 and Variant for CWE-126) are appropriate for capturing the specific nature of the weakness and its direct consequence.",
