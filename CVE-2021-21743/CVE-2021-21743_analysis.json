CWE-93, \"Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\", is a parent of CWE-113, \"Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\". Given the vulnerability involves **CRLF injection** specifically in HTTP headers, CWE-113 is a more specific variant of CWE-93. However, since the description focuses on the **CRLF injection** itself, CWE-93 is chosen as the primary weakness, with CWE-113 considered a secondary candidate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    \n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe93 primary\n    class cwe113 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences** in HTTP requests, leading to the ability to modify HTTP response headers.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the provided description. The description explicitly states a \"**CRLF injection** vulnerability,\" and the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms this. The **weakness** lies in the **improper handling of carriage return and line feed characters**, which allows an attacker to inject these characters into the HTTP response header.\n\nThe **Retriever Results** identified CWE-93 as the top candidate, which aligns perfectly with the **CRLF injection** vulnerability. CWE-113, a variant of CWE-93, was also considered due to its specificity regarding HTTP headers. However, the core issue is the **CRLF injection** itself, making CWE-93 the more appropriate primary classification.\n\nThe relationship analysis highlights the hierarchical connection between CWE-93 and CWE-113. While CWE-113 is more specific, the vulnerability description focuses on the broader issue of **CRLF injection**, justifying the selection of CWE-93 as the primary CWE.\n\nThe final decision is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**, which explicitly mentions the **CRLF injection** vulnerability. The selection of CWE-93 is further supported by its higher relevance score in the **Retriever Results**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reasoning for not selecting*: Although this CWE is a base level CWE, it is not relevant to the description which has a **CRLF injection** vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*Reasoning for not selecting*: Although this CWE relates to injections, the specific weakness is **CRLF injection**.
