## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-302 (Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data), is a base-level CWE, which aligns with the goal of identifying a specific root cause. It relates to CWE-471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)) as a parent, suggesting a broader category of vulnerabilities involving the modification of data assumed to be immutable, and to CWE-642 (External Control of Critical State Data) which is a Class level CWE. The relationships between CWE-302 and other authentication-related CWEs (like CWE-287) suggest potential avenues for exploitation or related vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **assigning the same session cookie to every admin session** (root cause). This leads to a **broken session management** issue and the **lack of proper validation or invalidation of session tokens** (weakness). Finally, this results in **permanent access if stolen**, meaning an attacker can impersonate an administrator and gain unauthorized access (impact).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment considered several CWEs, including those related to weak authentication, reliance on cookies, and cleartext storage of sensitive information. However, the core issue is the **assigning the same session cookie to every admin session**, which makes the cookie equivalent to a static password. This is best captured by CWE-302 (Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data), as the system **assumes the cookie is tied to a specific session but it can be reused** because it doesn't change upon logout. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section explicitly states: "when an admin user logs out, their session cookie is not invalidated or changed. Instead, it's temporarily disabled until the admin logs back in. The cookie remains the same, allowing for reuse." This evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-302.

CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a higher-level class, and while relevant, it does not capture the specific mechanism of the bypass. CWE-565 (Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking) is also relevant, but CWE-302 pinpoints the core problem: **the cookie itself is being treated as immutable and is not being rotated, allowing for reuse**.

The selection of CWE-302 is based on the specific evidence that the application **assumes the session cookie is valid without properly verifying its association with a specific user session** after logout. This allows an attacker with a stolen cookie to bypass authentication.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-784: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of a cookie, but it does not properly ensure that the cookie is valid for the associated user.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-565: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product relies on the existence or values of cookies when performing security-critical operations, but it does not properly ensure that the setting is valid for the associated user.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
