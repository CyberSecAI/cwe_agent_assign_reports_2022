It relates to CWE-471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)) as a parent, suggesting a broader category of vulnerabilities involving the modification of data assumed to be immutable, and to CWE-642 (External Control of Critical State Data) which is a Class level CWE. The relationships between CWE-302 and other authentication-related CWEs (like CWE-287) suggest potential avenues for exploitation or related vulnerabilities.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe302[\"CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\"]\n    cwe565[\"CWE-565: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe302 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe565\n    cwe302 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe302 primary\n    class cwe565,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **assigning the same session cookie to every admin session** (root cause). This leads to a **broken session management** issue and the **lack of proper validation or invalidation of session tokens** (weakness). Finally, this results in **permanent access if stolen**, meaning an attacker can impersonate an administrator and gain unauthorized access (impact).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered several CWEs, including those related to weak authentication, reliance on cookies, and cleartext storage of sensitive information. However, the core issue is the **assigning the same session cookie to every admin session**, which makes the cookie equivalent to a static password. This is best captured by CWE-302 (Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data), as the system **assumes the cookie is tied to a specific session but it can be reused** because it doesn't change upon logout. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section explicitly states: \"when an admin user logs out, their session cookie is not invalidated or changed. Instead, it's temporarily disabled until the admin logs back in. The cookie remains the same, allowing for reuse.\" This evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-302.\n\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a higher-level class, and while relevant, it does not capture the specific mechanism of the bypass. CWE-565 (Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking) is also relevant, but CWE-302 pinpoints the core problem: **the cookie itself is being treated as immutable and is not being rotated, allowing for reuse**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-302 is based on the specific evidence that the application **assumes the session cookie is valid without properly verifying its association with a specific user session** after logout. This allows an attacker with a stolen cookie to bypass authentication.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
