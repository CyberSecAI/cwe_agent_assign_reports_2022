It is related to CWE-922 [Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information] and CWE-522 [Insufficiently Protected Credentials] via ChildOf relationships. This means that CWE-922 and CWE-522 are higher-level abstractions of the same underlying issue. The choice of CWE-312 is driven by the specific mention of **insecure credential storage** which implies the sensitive information is stored in a way that it can be accessed without proper protection, which is the essence of cleartext storage.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe922[\"CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe922\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe922,cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events for this vulnerability is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Insecure credential storage** (CWE-312)\n2.  **Impact:** An attacker gains access to credential information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to CWE-312 [Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information] as the most appropriate CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **insecure credential storage**, and the impact is that an attacker can obtain access to credential information.\n\nThe provided evidence is strong, with the vulnerability description directly stating the weakness: \"The Tableau integration in RSA Archer ... is affected by an **insecure credential storage** vulnerability.\" This statement directly supports the selection of CWE-312.\n\nThe retriever results also support this choice, with CWE-312 listed as a possible candidate. While other CWEs like CWE-522 [Insufficiently Protected Credentials] and CWE-922 [Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information] are also considered, they are broader classifications. CWE-312 is more specific and accurately reflects the nature of the vulnerability.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-312 is a more specific child of the other considered CWEs, making it the optimal choice.\n\nThe selection of CWE-312 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly captures the **root cause** of the vulnerability which is storing sensitive information (credentials) in **cleartext**. While CWE-522 and CWE-922 are related, they are more general and do not specifically indicate the **cleartext storage** aspect.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAccording to WASC, \"Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
