It is related to CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command) and CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used as Input), indicating that it is a specific type of injection vulnerability. CWE-78 can follow CWE-184, meaning that an incomplete list of disallowed inputs could lead to OS command injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used as Input\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe184 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe78\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe74,cwe184 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements in an OS command (CWE-78), leading to **remote code execution**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates a **remote code execution** vulnerability in the Aruba AOS-CX Network Analytics Engine (NAE). The key phrase \"remote code execution\" suggests a potential for code injection or command injection.\n\nThe Retriever Results list CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) as the top candidate, with a score of 1.001. This aligns with the vulnerability description and the potential for command injection. The vulnerability description states: \"An authenticated **remote code execution** vulnerability was discovered in the AOS-CX Network Analytics Engine (NAE)...\". Given this evidence, CWE-78 appears to be the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is listed as a secondary candidate, but it is less likely to be the primary cause. The description for CWE-200 says it is often misused to represent the loss of confidentiality and there are better options. The description does not suggest that sensitive information is being leaked.\n\nCWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity) and CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature) are related to data authenticity and signature verification, which are not explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')) is another possible candidate as remote code execution could involve code injection. However, the name for CWE-94 specifically mentions the improper control of generation of code. This does not match the description, which only mentions remote code execution.\n\nBased on the evidence, CWE-78 is the most specific and relevant CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
