CWE-284 is a Pillar, making it too abstract. CWE-285 and CWE-863 are Classes, which are less preferred than Base-level CWEs. CWE-862 is a Base-level CWE and a child of both CWE-285 and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). The evidence strongly suggests a **lack of authorization**, thus leading to the selection of CWE-862.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe285 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    cwe287 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe287\n    cwe863 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe284,cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check, leading to unauthorized data access and modification.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified several potential CWEs, including CWE-78, CWE-20, CWE-79, and those related to authorization. However, based on the provided evidence, the root cause of the vulnerability is the **failure to properly limit access to resources**, which aligns with **missing authorization**.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" clearly states that the vulnerability exists due to a \"**failure to properly limit access**\" and results in \"**authorization bypass**\". This bypass allows low-privileged users to perform actions intended for administrators.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is based on the detailed analysis of the vulnerability description and supporting evidence, including the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\". The relationship analysis further reinforces this selection by highlighting the hierarchical structure of access control-related CWEs and the preference for Base-level CWEs. The mapping guidance for CWE-285 and CWE-284 explicitly discourages their use when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-862, is at the optimal level of specificity as it accurately reflects the **missing authorization** check that leads to the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or
