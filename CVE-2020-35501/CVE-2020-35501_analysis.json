The audit subsystem failed to record attempts to use the `open_by_handle_at` syscall with `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` capability. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is the direct match of the vulnerability to the description of CWE-778. While other CWEs like CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) were considered, they were not applicable since the issue wasn't about logging sensitive data, but rather the **lack of logging** a specific event.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe778[\"CWE-778: Insufficient Logging\"]\n    cwe223[\"CWE-223: Omission of Security-relevant Information\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n\n    cwe778 -->|CHILDOF| cwe223\n    cwe778 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe778 primary\n    class cwe223,cwe693 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n  1. **Root Cause:** **A flaw was found in the Linux kernels implementation of audit rules**.\n  2. **Weakness:** The audit subsystem's failure to log `open_by_handle_at` syscalls with `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH`.\n  3. **Impact:** Reduced monitoring capabilities and hindered forensic analysis.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the fact that a syscall wasn't being logged correctly. The provided evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-778. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" clearly states: \"The primary weakness is that the audit subsystem failed to record attempts to use the `open_by_handle_at` syscall with `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` capability. This is a flaw in the implementation of audit rules.\" This directly aligns with CWE-778's description: \"When a security-critical event occurs, the product either does not record the event or omits important details about the event when logging it.\"\n\nThe graph relationships further solidify this choice. CWE-778 is a child of CWE-223 (Omission of Security-relevant Information) and CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure), indicating that it falls under the broader categories of missing security information and failed protections.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it directly describes the **insufficient logging** issue, without being overly generic or focusing on specific types of logging failures.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n##
