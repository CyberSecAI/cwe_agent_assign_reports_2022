The secondary CWE is CWE-784, which is related to the reliance on cookies without validation and integrity checking.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe784[\"CWE-784: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision\"]\n    cwe807[\"CWE-807: Reliance on a Single Protection Mechanism\"]\n    cwe565[\"CWE-565: Reliance on Obfuscation\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe784 -->|ChildOf| cwe807\n    cwe784 -->|ChildOf| cwe565\n    cwe201 -->|ChildOf| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe784 secondary\n    class cwe807,cwe565,cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a **special crafted request** leading to **cookies being transferred to third parties**.\n  - The initial flaw is the **incorrect permission assignment for a critical resource** which leads to a vulnerability.\n  - The vulnerability is that **special crafted requests can lead to cookies being transferred to third parties**.\n  - The consequence is that **an attacker may be able to obtain sensitive information by having cookies transferred to them**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description states that \"special crafted requests can lead to cookies being transferred to third parties\" in multiple managed switches by WAGO.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-201 because the core issue is that sensitive information (cookies) is being inserted into data that is sent to third parties. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states the **weakness/vulnerability** is: \"Special crafted requests can lead to cookies being transferred to third parties,\" which directly aligns with CWE-201's description: \"The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\"\n\nCWE-784 is selected as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability involves **reliance on cookies without validation**. The vulnerability description doesn't explicitly mention a lack of validation, but the fact that cookies are being transferred to third parties suggests a failure to properly validate the cookies' intended recipient.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause and contributing factors of the vulnerability. CWE-201 captures the essence of sensitive data exposure, while CWE-784 highlights the role of cookie handling in this vulnerability.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE was not selected because the vulnerability description doesn't mention any issues related to CRLF sequences or HTTP request/response splitting.\n\n## CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE was not selected because the vulnerability description doesn't involve any inconsistencies in how HTTP requests are interpreted.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE was not selected because the vulnerability description doesn't describe a scenario where special elements are injected into a downstream component.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE was not selected because the vulnerability description doesn't involve path equivalence issues.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE was considered but not selected because it is a high-level class and CWE-201 is a more specific base class that is a better fit.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE was considered but not selected because CWE-201 more directly captures the act of sending sensitive information, rather than simply failing to remove it.
