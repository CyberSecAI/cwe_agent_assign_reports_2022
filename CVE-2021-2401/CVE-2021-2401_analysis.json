CWE-611 is a child of CWE-610: Improper Handling of Attributes and is a peer of CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary. The vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary provides sufficient evidence for CWE-611 to be selected. CWE-200 is a parent of CWE-203, CWE-497, and CWE-205.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe611[\"CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\"]\n    cwe610[\"CWE-610: Improper Handling of Attributes\"]\n    cwe441[\"CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe205[\"CWE-205: Observable Behavioral Discrepancy\"]\n\n    cwe611 -->|CHILDOF| cwe610\n    cwe611 -->|PEEROF| cwe441\n    cwe203 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe205 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe611 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe610,cwe441,cwe203,cwe497,cwe205 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper restriction of XML external entity reference** (CWE-611), leading to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis considered the vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference links content summary. The most relevant information was found in the CVE reference links content summary, which states, \"The vulnerability exists due to the **improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references** within the DOMParser endpoint of Oracle Business Intelligence.\" The impact of this vulnerability is that \"An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose **sensitive information** in the context of the service account by crafting a malicious XML document that specifies a URI for external resource retrieval.\"\n\nBased on the provided evidence, the primary CWE is CWE-611 (Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference), and a secondary CWE is CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor). The weakness is at the Base level, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The final selection is based on the detailed information provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary, which clearly indicates the root cause as an improper restriction of XML external entity references, leading to the potential exposure of sensitive information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
