CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-863. The vulnerability description suggests a user-controlled key aspect, making CWE-639 a relevant, more specific consideration but there isn't sufficient information to determine that the vulnerability is specifically exposed by a user-controlled key. CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is also a Class-level CWE and a peer of CWE-863. These relationships help refine the selection towards authorization-related issues, but without more information, it is harder to get more specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe668 -->|PEEROF| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe639,cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Common Table Expression queries not correctly checking the users permissions**, which leads to **read-access to resources beyond what those users were explicitly allowed to access**.\n\nRoot Cause: **Incorrect Authorization**\nImpact: Access to unauthorized resources.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-863 as the primary candidate due to the **incorrect permission checking**, which directly aligns with the description of **Incorrect Authorization**. The retriever results also support this, with CWE-863 being the top-ranked CWE.\n\nThe key phrase \"**read-access to resources beyond what those users were explicitly allowed to access**\" is the key evidence for this assessment.\n\nCWE-639 was considered because it addresses authorization bypass via user-controlled keys. This is a more specific instance of incorrect authorization, but the description doesn't definitively state that the bypass occurs due to a user-controlled key. This is a possible attack vector, but further information is needed.\n\nCWE-668 was considered but is too broad. The problem is with authorization, not simply exposing the resource to the wrong sphere.\n\nThe final decision is to primarily map to CWE-863, as it accurately captures the **incorrect authorization** mechanism, and to conditionally consider CWE-639 if further details confirm the user-controlled key aspect. The selection is based on matching the provided evidence to the CWE descriptions, relationship analysis, and mapping guidance.
