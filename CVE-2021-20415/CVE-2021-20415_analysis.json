It's also a child of CWE-799, which is a class level weakness. CWE-645 is a peer of CWE-307, as they both fall under the umbrella of authentication issues, but CWE-645 describes an overly restrictive lockout, the opposite of CWE-307.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe307[\"CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe799[\"CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\"]\n    cwe645[\"CWE-645: Overly Restrictive Account Lockout Mechanism\"]\n\n    cwe307 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe307 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe307 -->|CHILDOF| cwe799\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe307 primary\n    class cwe1390,cwe287,cwe799,cwe645 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **inadequate account lockout setting** (CWE-307), which leads to the possibility of a brute-force attack on account credentials. The root cause is the insufficient restriction on authentication attempts, and the impact is the potential compromise of accounts.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states an **inadequate account lockout setting**, which allows for brute-force attacks.\n\nThe primary selection is CWE-307 (Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts). The description of CWE-307 directly aligns with the vulnerability: \"The product does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts within a short time frame.\" The evidence from the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section states that the **rootcause** is an **inadequate account lockout setting**, which leads to the **impact** of a brute force account credentials attack, directly supporting this choice. The Confidence score is 1.0.\n\nCWE-799 (Improper Control of Interaction Frequency) was considered because it broadly covers cases where the frequency of interactions is not properly limited. While applicable, it is a Class-level CWE and less specific than CWE-307. Therefore, it is a secondary candidate with a lower confidence score of 0.5.\n\nCWE-645 (Overly Restrictive Account Lockout Mechanism) was also considered. However, the vulnerability description specifies an **inadequate** lockout, which is the opposite of an overly restrictive lockout. Thus, it is not a good fit, but is included as a secondary candidate. Confidence score of 0.3.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-307 directly addresses the **inadequate account lockout setting**, and it is a Base-level CWE.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts within a short time frame.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
