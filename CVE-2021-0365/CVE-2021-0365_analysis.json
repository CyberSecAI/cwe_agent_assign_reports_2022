It has a hierarchical relationship as a ChildOf CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference) and CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiration). It can also precede CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size) or CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition). CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a Base level CWE and a ChildOf CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-787 can follow CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe120\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe123\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **use after free** (CWE-416), which leads to **memory corruption**. This **memory corruption** could potentially result in an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) if the freed memory is reallocated and then improperly written to. The final impact is a local escalation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-416 (Use After Free) as the primary weakness, based on the vulnerability description explicitly stating \"**use after free**\". The **memory corruption** cited in the description is a symptom of that **use after free**.\n\nThe provided evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section contains \"**rootcause: use after free**\" and \"**weakness: memory corruption**\". This explicitly points to CWE-416 as the root cause.\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) was considered as a secondary CWE, as the \"Top CWEs\" section of the provided document lists it as the primary match for similar vulnerabilities. However, the description only speaks of a general **memory corruption**, without explicitly stating that this corruption is due to a write outside of the allocated buffer. CWE-787 is a possible consequence of CWE-416, but it is not explicitly stated in the description.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-416 is a Variant, which is a preferred level of abstraction. CWE-787 is a Base CWE, also a preferred level of abstraction.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-667 (Improper Locking), CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource), CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')), CWE-909 (Missing Initialization of Resource), CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition), CWE-665 (Improper Initialization), CWE-415 (Double Free), and CWE-413 (Improper Resource Locking): These CWEs were not selected because they are not directly supported by the vulnerability description. The description explicitly mentions a **use after free**, which directly corresponds to CWE-416. The other CWEs don't have direct evidence.",
