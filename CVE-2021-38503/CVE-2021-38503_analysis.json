CWE-942 is a variant of CWE-863, CWE-923, and CWE-183, all related to incorrect authorization, restriction of communication channels, and permissive input lists, respectively. It can also precede CWE-668, suggesting a potential chain. The abstraction levels guide the selection towards the most specific representation (Variant for CWE-942) while still recognizing the broader context (Class for CWE-668).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe942[\"CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe923[\"CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\"]\n    cwe183[\"CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\"]\n\n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe923\n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe183\n    cwe942 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe668 primary\n    class cwe942 secondary\n    class cwe863,cwe923,cwe183 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves an **incorrect application of iframe sandbox rules**, leading to a **bypass of restrictions** and ultimately, the **exposure of resources to the wrong sphere**.\n  - Root Cause: **Incorrect application of iframe sandbox rules**\n  - Weakness: **Bypass restrictions such as executing scripts or navigating the top-level frame**.\n  - Impact: An iframe can **bypass restrictions, such as executing scripts or navigating the top-level frame**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting impact. The vulnerability description clearly states that iframe sandbox rules were not correctly applied, allowing a bypass of security restrictions. This aligns with the concept of exposing resources to the wrong control sphere (CWE-668). Further specificity is added by recognizing that this involves cross-domain policy issues, making CWE-942 a relevant secondary CWE.\n\nThe graph relationships helped refine the selection, emphasizing the hierarchical structure and the potential chain of events. The final decision is based on a combination of direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the contextual understanding provided by the CWE relationships.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity. CWE-668 captures the general issue of exposing resources inappropriately, while CWE-942 provides a more specific context related to cross-domain policies.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
