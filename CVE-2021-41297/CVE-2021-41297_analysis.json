It is related to CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) as a child, suggesting a more general category of credential protection issues. Also related is CWE-1220, which is a Base level CWE that means access controls lack the required granularity. The selection of CWE-312 is more specific because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"plain-text\", indicating that the credentials were not encrypted or protected in any way.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe1220[\"CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe1220 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe1220 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses starts with a **weak access control mechanism**, leading to the disclosure of administrative account credentials in plain text.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several candidate CWEs, including CWE-256, CWE-522, CWE-1390, CWE-312, CWE-732, CWE-1220, CWE-305, CWE-916, CWE-798 and CWE-1391.\nThe vulnerability description states the vulnerability is due to a **weak access control mechanism** allowing an authenticated user to remotely escalate privileges by disclosing credentials of administrative accounts in plain-text.\n\nThe most appropriate CWE is CWE-312 **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information**. This is because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the credentials are disclosed in \"plain-text\", which indicates that the credentials are not encrypted or protected in any way.\nCWE-1220 **Insufficient Granularity of Access Control** is a secondary candidate because the **weak access control mechanism** could be because of Insufficient Granularity.\nThe other CWEs were rejected because they did not accurately describe the vulnerability. For example, CWE-256 **Plaintext Storage of a Password** is similar to CWE-312, but CWE-312 is more general and applies to all types of sensitive information. CWE-522 **Insufficiently Protected Credentials** is too general, as it does not specify the credentials are stored in plain-text. CWE-1390 **Weak Authentication** is also too general, as it does not specify the credentials are disclosed in plain-text.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following
