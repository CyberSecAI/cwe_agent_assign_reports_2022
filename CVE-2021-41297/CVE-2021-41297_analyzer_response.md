# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2021-41297

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-1220 | Insufficient Granularity of Access Control | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-312, which is a base-level CWE indicating sensitive information stored in cleartext. It is related to CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) as a child, suggesting a more general category of credential protection issues. Also related is CWE-1220, which is a Base level CWE that means access controls lack the required granularity. The selection of CWE-312 is more specific because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions "plain-text", indicating that the credentials were not encrypted or protected in any way.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of weaknesses starts with a **weak access control mechanism**, leading to the disclosure of administrative account credentials in plain text.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified several candidate CWEs, including CWE-256, CWE-522, CWE-1390, CWE-312, CWE-732, CWE-1220, CWE-305, CWE-916, CWE-798 and CWE-1391.
The vulnerability description states the vulnerability is due to a **weak access control mechanism** allowing an authenticated user to remotely escalate privileges by disclosing credentials of administrative accounts in plain-text.

The most appropriate CWE is CWE-312 **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information**. This is because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the credentials are disclosed in "plain-text", which indicates that the credentials are not encrypted or protected in any way.
CWE-1220 **Insufficient Granularity of Access Control** is a secondary candidate because the **weak access control mechanism** could be because of Insufficient Granularity.
The other CWEs were rejected because they did not accurately describe the vulnerability. For example, CWE-256 **Plaintext Storage of a Password** is similar to CWE-312, but CWE-312 is more general and applies to all types of sensitive information. CWE-522 **Insufficiently Protected Credentials** is too general, as it does not specify the credentials are stored in plain-text. CWE-1390 **Weak Authentication** is also too general, as it does not specify the credentials are disclosed in plain-text.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
To fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.
