Also, **CWE-352** [CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] is listed as a secondary issue, which is a compound CWE that requires other CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe441[\"CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary\"]\n    cwe642[\"CWE-642: External Control of Critical State Data\"]\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n    cwe352 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe346\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe441\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe642\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe613\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe943,cwe352,cwe345,cwe441,cwe642,cwe613 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **improper neutralization** of user-supplied input (`mac_filter` parameter) which is used in constructing SQL queries. This leads to the **SQL injection** vulnerability. The vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated user or via **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a clear **SQL injection** (**CWE-89** [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')]) vulnerability due to **improper neutralization** of special elements in an SQL command. The description states, \"A specially-crafted HTTP request can lead to **SQL injection**.\" This aligns directly with the description of **CWE-89** [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')].\n\nThe **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** further supports this by stating, \"The vulnerability is due to **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an SQL command, specifically within the `device_list` page... The application uses prepared statements in combination with stored procedures and SQL concatenation in a way that user-supplied input, despite initial sanitization, loses its protection and introduces SQL injection vulnerabilities.\"\n\nThe retriever results also list **CWE-89** [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] as the top hit with a score of 1.0. The mapping guidance for **CWE-89** [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] states that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\nThe vulnerability description also mentions that the vulnerability can be exploited through cross-site request forgery. This indicates a **CWE-352** [CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] vulnerability in addition to **CWE-89** [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')].\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   **CWE-79** [CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]: While XSS is a common web vulnerability, the description focuses on SQL injection, not script injection in a web page. Therefore, it is less relevant.\n*   **CWE-918** [CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)]: There's no indication that the application is making requests to other servers based on user input.\n*   **CWE-134** [CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String]: There is no mention of format string usage in the description.\n*   **CWE-444** [CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')]: There is no mention of HTTP request smuggling.\n*   **CWE-184** [CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs]: While input validation is mentioned, the core issue is improper neutralization for SQL, not an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.\n*   **CWE-113** [CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')]: There's no evidence of CRLF injection in HTTP headers.\n*   **CWE-611** [CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference]: There's no evidence of XML processing or external entity injection.\n*   **CWE-80** [CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)]: Similar to **CWE-79** [CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')], this is less relevant than the SQL injection.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because **CWE-89** [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] directly addresses the root cause of the SQL injection and **CWE-352** [CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] addresses the CSRF aspect of the vulnerability.",
