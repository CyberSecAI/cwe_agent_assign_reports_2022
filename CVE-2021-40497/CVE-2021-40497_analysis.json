More specific than CWE-200 but lacks precise detail. |\n| CWE-749 | Exposed Dangerous Method or Function | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed. Could be applicable if the endpoints are considered dangerous methods. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is the hierarchical structure with CWE-200 (Class) as the parent of CWE-497 (Base). While CWE-497 is more specific, it doesn't fully capture the vulnerability's details, so CWE-200 is retained as a broader classification. CWE-749 (Base) is considered due to the \"application endpoints\" mentioned, potentially indicating exposed methods, but the evidence is not strong enough for primary classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe749[\"CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function\"]\n\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe749 -->|PEEROF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe497,cwe749 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the exploitation of application endpoints leading to the exposure of system-specific data.\n\nInitial Flaw: Exploitable application endpoints.\nWeakness: **Exposure of Sensitive Information**.\nImpact: Exposure of system-specific data like its version.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified several potential CWEs, including CWE-668, CWE-200, and CWE-497. The final conclusion favors CWE-200 as the primary classification because the **exposure of sensitive information** is the key characteristic of the vulnerability. However, due to the system-specific nature of the exposed data, CWE-497 is included as a secondary classification. CWE-749 is also considered due to the mention of application endpoints.\n\nThe decision is based on the vulnerability description, which states that an attacker can \"exploit certain application endpoints to read **sensitive data**\" and that \"successful exploitation could lead to **exposure of some system specific data** like its version.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, given the available evidence. While more specific CWEs might exist, they would require additional information not provided in the description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
