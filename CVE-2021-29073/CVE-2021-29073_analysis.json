This reflects the vulnerability's specific nature, as it's a buffer overflow occurring on the stack. CWE-119 is a more general Class-level CWE, making CWE-121 a more precise choice. CWE-787, while relevant, doesn't specify the location of the buffer.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|PARENTOF| cwe124[\"CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\"]\n    cwe119 -->|PARENTOF| cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **stack-based buffer overflow** (**weakness**), leading to potential arbitrary code execution or denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly supports the selection of CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"stack-based buffer overflow,\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this **weakness** as the root cause.\n\nThe evidence is: \"Certain NETGEAR devices are affected by a **stack-based buffer overflow** by an authenticated user.\" and \"Root cause of vulnerability: A post-authentication stack overflow.\"\n\nCWE-121 is a Variant-level CWE, providing a more specific classification than its parent CWEs, CWE-787 and CWE-119. While CWE-119 is a broader category, and CWE-787 covers out-of-bounds writes in general, CWE-121 accurately captures the location of the overflow on the stack. The retriever results also list CWE-121, lending additional support to this selection. The mapping guidance for CWE-119 advises considering its children for more precise mappings.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or
