The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**Improper Access Control**\", but the CVE reference links provide more detailed information about the root cause: the `/search/users/select` endpoint lacked proper authentication and authorization checks, allowing unauthenticated users to access user email addresses. This indicates a **missing authorization** check.\n\nBased on the evidence, the most appropriate CWE is **CWE-862: Missing Authorization**.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision includes:\n\n*   The vulnerability description key phrases indicating \"**Improper Access Control**\"\n*   The CVE Reference Links Content Summary stating the endpoint \"**did not enforce proper authentication or authorization checks**\"\n*   The CVE Reference Links Content Summary detailing that \"**unauthenticated users to access user data**\"\n\nWhile **CWE-284: Improper Access Control** is a broader category encompassing the issue, **CWE-862: Missing Authorization** provides a more specific and accurate classification. The mapping guidance for **CWE-284** also suggests using more specific descendants like **CWE-862**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n\n**CWE-862: Missing Authorization**\n\n### Description\n\nWhen an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, the product does not perform an authorization check to verify that the actor is allowed to access the resource or perform the action.\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n## CWE-284: Improper Access Control\n**Abstraction:** Pillar\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.\n**Mapping Guidance:**\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-284 is extremely high-level, a Pillar.
