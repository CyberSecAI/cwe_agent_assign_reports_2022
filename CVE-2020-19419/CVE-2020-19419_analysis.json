It is a child of CWE-287 **[Improper Authentication]**, which in turn is a child of CWE-284 **[Improper Access Control]**. CWE-284 is a high-level pillar, making CWE-306 a more specific and appropriate choice given the available evidence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** (**WEAKNESS**) for the administrator console, which leads to the ability of remote attackers to **obtain sensitive device information** (**IMPACT**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **incorrect access control** (**WEAKNESS**) reported in the vulnerability description. However, after analyzing the retriever results and the complete CWE specifications, CWE-306 **[Missing Authentication for Critical Function]** appears to be a more precise classification. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that remote attackers can obtain sensitive device information **without authentication**, indicating that the root cause is the **lack of authentication** rather than an incorrect implementation of access control.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision comes directly from the vulnerability description: \"**Incorrect Access Control** in Emerson Smart Wireless Gateway 1420 4.6.59 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive device information from the administrator console **without authentication**.\"\n\nCWE-284 **[Improper Access Control]** was considered but deemed too generic. While it's technically correct, CWE-306 **[Missing Authentication for Critical Function]** offers a more accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability. CWE-863 **[Incorrect Authorization]** was also considered, but it implies that an authorization check is performed but is done incorrectly, which doesn't align with the \"**without authentication**\" aspect of the vulnerability. The retriever results also favored CWE-306 over CWE-863.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
