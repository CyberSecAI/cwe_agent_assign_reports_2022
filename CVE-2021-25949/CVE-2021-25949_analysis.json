The \"**rootcause: prototype pollution**\" phrase in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section directly aligns with the CWE-1321 description, which focuses on the improper control of modifications to object prototypes. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms that the `setGetter()` function lacks validation, allowing manipulation of the object's prototype, further supporting CWE-1321.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1321 is based on the high degree of specificity it offers compared to its parent CWE-915. While CWE-915 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes) is relevant, CWE-1321 specifically addresses the \"**prototype pollution**\" issue, making it the more accurate and appropriate choice.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section contains the following details.\n```\n{\n  \"guidelines_version\": \"3\",\n  \"cve_id\": \"CVE-2021-25949\",\n  \"response\": {\n    \"relevant\": true,\n    \"summary\": \"The vulnerability is due to the `setGetter()` function in the 'set-getter' NPM module not validating the object type before assigning the value to a property, leading to prototype pollution.
