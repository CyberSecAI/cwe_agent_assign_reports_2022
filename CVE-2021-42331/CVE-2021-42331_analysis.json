CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization). While CWE-285 is a broader class, CWE-862 more precisely captures the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **missing authorization** check. CWE-425 is a possible consequence of the missing authorization, where an attacker can directly request resources.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe288\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check (CWE-862) in the Study Edit function. This allows remote attackers to directly request and edit other users' tutorial schedules by crafting URL parameters. The ability to craft URL parameters and access/edit resources directly without proper authorization aligns with the concept of Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') (CWE-425).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability based on the provided description. The key phrase \"**missing permission control**\" strongly suggests a **missing authorization** check. The \"Retriever Results\" also highlighted CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as a potential candidate. The final decision to select CWE-862 as the primary CWE is based on the explicit mention of **missing permission control** in the vulnerability description, aligning with the definition of **missing authorization**.\n\nThe provided evidence explicitly states: \"The Study Edit function of ShinHer StudyOnline System does not perform permission control.\" This directly supports the selection of CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). The vulnerability description also indicates that attackers can \"access and edit other users tutorial schedule by crafting URL parameters,\" which suggests CWE-425 (Direct Request).\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was considered, but it is a broader class encompassing both **missing** and **incorrect authorization**. Since the description specifically mentions **missing permission control**, CWE-862 is a more precise fit. Other CWEs like CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) were considered, but the focus is on authorization rather than authentication in this scenario.\n\nCWE-425 (Direct Request) was considered as a result of the **missing authorization** and crafting of URL parameters.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
