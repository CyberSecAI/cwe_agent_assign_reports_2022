# Analysis for CVE-2021-0931

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-20: Improper Input Validation | Improper Input Validation | 0.8 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-223 | Omission of Security-relevant Information | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the selection was that CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation** is a very general **Class** that encapsulates the high-level issue. The **Vulnerability Description** mentions **missing data filtering**. The secondary CWE is CWE-223 **Omission of Security-relevant Information**, a **Base** level CWE that is related to the "misleading permission dialogs" impact.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events begins with the **missing data filtering** (**ROOTCAUSE**), leading to the creation of misleading permission dialogs, which could result in local information disclosure.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified **missing data filtering** as the **ROOTCAUSE**. The retriever results suggested several potential CWEs, including CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), CWE-790 (Improper Filtering of Special Elements), and CWE-223 (Omission of Security-relevant Information).

The final decision was to assign CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation** as the primary CWE, and CWE-223 **Omission of Security-relevant Information** as a secondary CWE.

The CWE selection is based on the evidence: "In getAlias of BluetoothDevice.java, there is a possible way to create misleading permission dialogs due to **missing data filtering**."

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-20 is a high-level class that encompasses the general problem of **improper input validation**. CWE-223 is a more specific base CWE that addresses the omission of security-relevant information, which leads to misleading permission dialogs.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-665: Improper Initialization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
