The **Vulnerability Description** mentions **missing data filtering**. The secondary CWE is CWE-223 **Omission of Security-relevant Information**, a **Base** level CWE that is related to the \"misleading permission dialogs\" impact.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe223[\"CWE-223: Omission of Security-relevant Information\"]\n    \n    cwe223 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe223 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events begins with the **missing data filtering** (**ROOTCAUSE**), leading to the creation of misleading permission dialogs, which could result in local information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **missing data filtering** as the **ROOTCAUSE**. The retriever results suggested several potential CWEs, including CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), CWE-790 (Improper Filtering of Special Elements), and CWE-223 (Omission of Security-relevant Information).\n\nThe final decision was to assign CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation** as the primary CWE, and CWE-223 **Omission of Security-relevant Information** as a secondary CWE.\n\nThe CWE selection is based on the evidence: \"In getAlias of BluetoothDevice.java, there is a possible way to create misleading permission dialogs due to **missing data filtering**.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-20 is a high-level class that encompasses the general problem of **improper input validation**. CWE-223 is a more specific base CWE that addresses the omission of security-relevant information, which leads to misleading permission dialogs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
