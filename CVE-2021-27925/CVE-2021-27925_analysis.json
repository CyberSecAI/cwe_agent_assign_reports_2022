The relationship analysis focuses on how this **race condition** leads to the exposure of credentials in cleartext within a log file. CWE-362 is a Class-level CWE, and it has child CWEs that could potentially be more specific. However, given the information provided, CWE-362 directly addresses the **race condition** aspect of the vulnerability. CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) and CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) are consequences of the **race condition**, and add more details to the impact of the vulnerability. These relationships help establish a chain from the initial **race condition** to the final impact of credential leakage in cleartext.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe532 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe362\n    cwe319 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe532\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe532,cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with a **race condition** (CWE-362) within the Couchbase Server View Engine when Auditing is enabled. This **race condition** leads to an internal user's (ns_server) credentials being leaked in cleartext. These credentials are then inserted into the ns_server.info.log file (CWE-532) in cleartext (CWE-319).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the primary focus was on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **race condition**. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **race condition** as the trigger for the credential leakage.\n\nThe description states: \"When using the View Engine and Auditing is enabled, a crash condition can (depending on a **race condition**) cause an internal user with administrator privileges, @ns_server, to have its credentials leaked in cleartext in the ns_server.info.log file.\"\n\nThis statement directly supports the selection of CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('**Race Condition**')) as the primary CWE. The Retriever Results also list CWE-362 as the top combined result with a score of 1.000.\n\nThe leakage of credentials in cleartext is then mapped to CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) because the credentials end up in the log file. The fact that the credentials are in cleartext in the log file maps to CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information).\n\nCWE-362 is a Class-level CWE, but it is the most accurate representation of the described **race condition**. Other potential CWEs, such as those related to improper resource management, were considered but deemed less relevant because the primary issue is the concurrent execution and lack of synchronization.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear and accurate representation of the vulnerability based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
