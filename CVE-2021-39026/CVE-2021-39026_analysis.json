CWE-614 is a more specific case of CWE-319, however, the vulnerability description focuses on the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**, which directly prevents cleartext transmission. Thus, CWE-319 is the better fit as the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe614 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**, leading to potential cleartext transmission of sensitive information. This exposes the system to man-in-the-middle attacks, ultimately resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-319 as the primary candidate due to the explicit mention of the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**, which directly relates to cleartext transmission.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security** could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating that the root cause is an information exposure.\n\nCWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is a Base level CWE that perfectly aligns with the vulnerability. The relationship analysis and retriever results support this selection. The Retriever Results listed CWE-319 as the top combined result.\n\nCWE-614 (Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute) was considered because it is a variant of CWE-319 and also relevant, especially if cookies are involved. However, since the description doesn't specifically mention cookies, but rather the general **failure to properly enable HSTS**, CWE-319 is the more accurate and generalizable root cause. If HSTS was enabled, the cookies would be protected even if they are marked with the secure flag or not.\n\nTherefore, CWE-319 is the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
