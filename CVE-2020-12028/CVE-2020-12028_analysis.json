Additionally, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a sibling to CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). Since the vulnerability description mentioned that the handlers \"do not enforce appropriate permissions\", it aligns more precisely with missing authentication rather than incorrect authorization, but both are related. The base abstraction level of CWE-306 is also preferred over the Class level of CWE-863.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -- PEER OF --> cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe285,cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses is relatively straightforward: **missing authentication** leads to the ability of an authenticated attacker to interact with data on a remote endpoint. The handlers **do not enforce appropriate permissions** leading to the **impact:** interact with the data on the remote endpoint.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed to CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) as the primary weakness, because the vulnerability description explicitly states that certain handlers \"do not enforce appropriate permissions\". This indicates a lack of authentication for those handlers.\n\nThe key piece of evidence is: \"an authenticated attacker may be able to utilize certain handlers to interact with the data on the remote endpoint since those handlers **do not enforce appropriate permissions**.\"\n\nThe relationship graph and the definitions support the selection of CWE-306 at the base level of abstraction. It directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) were considered but deemed less appropriate because the issue is not that authorization is performed incorrectly, but that it is completely missing for critical functions.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**\n**Usage:** Allowed\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**\n**Usage:** Discouraged",
