# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-25309

# Vulnerability Description

    The telnet administrator service running on port 650 on Gigaset DX600A v41.00-175 devices does not implement any lockout or throttling functionality. This situation (together with the **weak password policy** that forces a 4-digit password) allows remote attackers to easily obtain administrative access via brute-force attacks.
