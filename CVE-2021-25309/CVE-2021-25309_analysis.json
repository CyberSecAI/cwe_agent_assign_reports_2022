This is compounded by the **weak password policy**, which is a specific type of **weak credential** usage. The relationship between CWE-307 and CWE-1391 is such that CWE-307 enables the exploitation of the **weak password policy** (CWE-1391).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe307[\"CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe307 -->|ENABLES| cwe1391\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe307 primary\n    class cwe1391 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of lockout/throttling** (CWE-307), combined with a **weak password policy**, leading to an increased attack surface. This allows remote attackers to **obtain administrative access** via brute-force attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root causes and impacts of the vulnerability. The primary driver is the **improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts** (CWE-307), as highlighted by the vulnerability description: \"does not implement any lockout or throttling functionality.\" This is further aggravated by the **weak password policy** (CWE-1391), making brute-force attacks feasible.\n\nThe relationship analysis showed that CWE-307 directly enables the exploitation of the weak password policy. Given the available evidence, selecting CWE-307 as the primary CWE and CWE-1391 as a secondary CWE provides an optimal level of specificity while accurately representing the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant
