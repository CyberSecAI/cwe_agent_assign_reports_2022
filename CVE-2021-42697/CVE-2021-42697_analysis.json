Recursion without proper limits can lead to **stack exhaustion**, which is the core issue described in the vulnerability. CWE-674 is related to CWE-834 (Excessive Iteration) and could lead to other resource exhaustion issues.\n\nCWE-1325 is a Base-level CWE that describes improperly controlled sequential memory allocation, often leading to **stack exhaustion** as a technical impact.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    cwe1325[\"CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\"]\n\n    cwe674 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    cwe1325 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe674 primary\n    class cwe1325 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **unbounded recursion** due to the lack of depth limit when parsing nested comments in the `User-Agent` header. This leads to excessive memory allocation on the stack (**stack exhaustion**), ultimately causing a denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **stack exhaustion** caused by deeply nested comments in the User-Agent header. The primary weakness is the **uncontrolled recursion** when parsing these comments.\n\nThe evidence is strong, as the CVE description explicitly mentions **stack exhaustion** and the CVE reference links confirm **unbounded recursion** as the root cause.\n\nThe selection of CWE-674 is based on the vulnerability description, CVE Reference Links Content Summary, and Retriever Results. It best describes the root cause of the issue: the lack of control over the amount of recursion. CWE-1325 is chosen as a secondary CWE as the **stack exhaustion** occurs from improper sequential memory allocation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that

Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of

children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe

be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity

that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 8731.26\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 8370.08\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe
