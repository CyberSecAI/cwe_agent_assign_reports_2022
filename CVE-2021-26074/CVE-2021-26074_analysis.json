Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function. |\n| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review. This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the parent-child relationship between CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). CWE-287 and CWE-863 are both children of CWE-284, representing specific types of access control failures.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **broken authentication** (**WEAKNESS**): the system incorrectly accepts context JWTs where it should only accept server-to-server JWTs. This leads to the impact of an attacker being able to send authenticated re-installation events.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary both point to a **broken authentication** (**WEAKNESS**) mechanism. The system erroneously accepts context JWTs in lifecycle endpoints where only server-to-server JWTs should be accepted. This leads to an attacker's ability to send authenticated re-installation events.\n\nThe Retriever Results suggested CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) as the top candidate. While CWE-287 is a Class-level CWE and MITRE discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available, it accurately reflects the **WEAKNESS** described in the vulnerability. The detailed CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause** is related to the incorrect validation of JWTs, which falls under the umbrella of **Improper Authentication**.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered as a secondary candidate, as the **broken authentication** (**WEAKNESS**) ultimately leads to an authorization bypass. However, the primary issue lies in the authentication process itself, making CWE-287 the more appropriate primary mapping.\n\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, specifically the statements about **broken authentication** (**WEAKNESS**) and insecure JWT handling, strongly supports the selection of CWE-287. The relationships between CWE-287 and other access control-related CWEs helped refine the understanding of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the available information. While more specific variants of CWE-287 might exist, the current evidence does not provide enough detail to justify their selection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
