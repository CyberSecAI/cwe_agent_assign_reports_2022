The retriever results suggest it, but it's discouraged because it represents the impact rather than the root cause. However, the vulnerability description indicates that the core issue is the **exposure of NTLMv2 credentials**, fitting the description of CWE-200.\n\nCWE-618 is a Variant of CWE-749 (ActiveX Control Contains Unsafe Functions). While potentially relevant due to the involvement of an ActiveX control, it does not directly address the **information exposure** aspect as precisely as CWE-200.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe618[\"CWE-618: Exposed Unsafe ActiveX Method\"]\n    cwe749[\"CWE-749: ActiveX Control Contains Unsafe Functions\"]\n    \n    cwe618 -->|CHILDOF| cwe749\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe618 secondary\n    class cwe749 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a user visiting a malicious webpage. Then, the ActiveX control allows the **exposure of NTLMv2 credentials**, leading to potential unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the focus was on finding a root cause related to improper input validation or memory corruption (based on similar CVEs). However, after reviewing the provided \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", the **root cause is the information exposure** itself. The **vulnerability description key phrase \"Information Disclosure\"** and the summary stating \"**Root cause of vulnerability: Information Exposure**\" solidify this assessment.\n\nCWE-200 is chosen despite being discouraged because it directly captures the essence of the vulnerability: the **exposure of sensitive information (NTLMv2 credentials)** to an unauthorized actor. While a more specific CWE might exist if the exact mechanism of exposure was known, the available evidence doesn't provide that level of detail. The attack vector is user interaction (visiting a malicious page), which triggers the ActiveX control to expose the credentials.\n\nThe retriever results and graph relationships helped prioritize CWE-200 and CWE-618, but the final decision leans heavily on the provided summary of the CVE content and the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive -
