If captured, the TOTP code for the 2FA can be submitted correctly more than once.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **weakness:** **Authentication Bypass**\n- **impact:** gain privileges\n- **vector:** If captured, the TOTP code for the 2FA can be submitted correctly more than once\n- **attacker:** malicious user\n- **product:** Gitea\n- **version:** before 1.5.0\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nThe provided content is related to CVE-2021-45331. This CVE is about the re-use of TOTP passcodes in Gitea, and this pull request addresses that issue.\n\n- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application was allowing the reuse of TOTP passcodes. This could allow an attacker who has intercepted a valid TOTP passcode to reuse it for authentication.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is the lack of validation to prevent reuse of TOTP passcodes during authentication.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to a user account if they intercepted a valid TOTP passcode and the server did not prevent its reuse.\n- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves an attacker intercepting a TOTP passcode (e.g. via a Man-in-the-Middle attack).\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and the Gitea server, or to obtain a valid TOTP passcode through other means. The attacker would then attempt to authenticate with the stolen token before it expires (within 30 seconds).\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 287 | Improper Authentication | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.174 |\n| 2 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.165 |\n| 3 | 602 | Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.159 |\n| 4 | 459 | Incomplete Cleanup | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.159 |\n| 5 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.154 |\n| 6 | 305 | Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.573 |\n| 7 | 290 | Authentication Bypass by Spoofing | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 347 | Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.152 |\n| 9 | 798 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.152 |\n| 10 | 522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.151 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nWhen an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nauthentification: An alternate term is \"authentification\", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.\nAuthN: \"AuthN\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authentication\" within the web application security community.

In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.\n\n  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1391\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-344\nChildOf -> CWE-671\nPeerOf -> CWE-257\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nAn **Authentication Bypass** vulnerability exists in Gitea before 1.5.0, which could let a malicious user gain privileges. If captured, the TOTP code for the 2FA can be submitted correctly more than once.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **weakness:** **Authentication Bypass**\n- **impact:** gain privileges\n- **vector:** If captured, the TOTP code for the 2FA can be submitted correctly more than once\n- **attacker:** malicious user\n- **product:** Gitea\n- **version:** before 1.5.0\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nThe provided content is related to CVE-2021-45331. This CVE is about the re-use of TOTP passcodes in Gitea, and this pull request addresses that issue.\n\n- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application was allowing the reuse of TOTP passcodes. This could allow an attacker who has intercepted a valid TOTP passcode to reuse it for authentication.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is the lack of validation to prevent reuse of TOTP passcodes during authentication.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to a user account if they intercepted a valid TOTP passcode and the server did not prevent its reuse.\n- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves an attacker intercepting a TOTP passcode (e.g. via a Man-in-the-Middle attack).\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and the Gitea server, or to obtain a valid TOTP passcode through other means. The attacker would then attempt to authenticate with the stolen token before it expires (within 30 seconds).\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 287 | Improper Authentication | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.174 |\n| 2 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.165 |\n| 3 | 602 | Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.159 |\n| 4 | 459 | Incomplete Cleanup | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.159 |\n| 5 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.154 |\n| 6 | 305 | Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.573 |\n| 7 | 290 | Authentication Bypass by Spoofing | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 347 | Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.152 |\n| 9 | 798 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.152 |\n| 10 | 522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.151 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nWhen an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nauthentification: An alternate term is \"authentification\", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.\nAuthN: \"AuthN\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authentication\" within the web application security community.
