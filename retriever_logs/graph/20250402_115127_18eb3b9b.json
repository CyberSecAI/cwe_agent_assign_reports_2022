It was fixed in version 0.6.2.\n*   The fix involves replacing `execlp` with `execve` and hardcoding the path to `seatd`, preventing environment variable manipulation.\n*   The SUID bit on `seatd-launch` is not set by default during installation, requiring an explicit action by the packager or user to create the vulnerability.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 426 | Untrusted Search Path | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.272 |\n| 2 | 73 | External Control of File Name or Path | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.205 |\n| 3 | 250 | Execution with Unnecessary Privileges | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.176 |\n| 4 | 269 | Improper Privilege Management | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.162 |\n| 5 | 427 | Uncontrolled Search Path Element | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.147 |\n| 6 | 403 | Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere ('File Descriptor Leak') | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.472 |\n| 7 | 98 | Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion') | Variant | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 732 | Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.141 |\n| 9 | 267 | Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.136 |\n| 10 | 204 | Observable Response Discrepancy | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.136 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product searches for critical resources using an externally-supplied search path that can point to resources that are not under the product's direct control.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis might allow attackers to execute their own programs, access unauthorized data files, or modify configuration in unexpected ways. If the product uses a search path to locate critical resources such as programs, then an attacker could modify that search path to point to a malicious program, which the targeted product would then execute. The problem extends to any type of critical resource that the product trusts.\n\n\nSome of the most common variants of untrusted search path are:\n\n\n  - In various UNIX and Linux-based systems, the PATH environment variable may be consulted to locate executable programs, and LD_PRELOAD may be used to locate a separate library.\n\n  - In various Microsoft-based systems, the PATH environment variable is consulted to locate a DLL, if the DLL is not found in other paths that appear earlier in the search order.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nUntrusted Path\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-668\nChildOf -> CWE-673\nPeerOf -> CWE-427\nPeerOf -> CWE-428\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1120:** Application relies on its PATH environment variable to find and execute program.\n- **CVE-2008-1810:** Database application relies on its PATH environment variable to find and execute program.\n- **CVE-2007-2027:** Chain: untrusted search path enabling resultant format string by loading malicious internationalization messages.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.\n\n\nPath manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:\n\n```\n\t\t1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.\n\t\t2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.\n```\nFor example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-610\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\nCanPrecede -> CWE-434\nCanPrecede -> CWE-59\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.\n\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThe external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.\n\n\nHowever, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.\n\n\nThe external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.\n- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an operation at a privilege level that is higher than the minimum level required, which creates new weaknesses or amplifies the consequences of other weaknesses.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nNew weaknesses can be exposed because running with extra privileges, such as root or Administrator, can disable the normal security checks being performed by the operating system or surrounding environment. Other pre-existing weaknesses can turn into security vulnerabilities if they occur while operating at raised privileges.\n\n\nPrivilege management functions can behave in some less-than-obvious ways, and they have different quirks on different platforms. These inconsistencies are particularly pronounced if you are transitioning from one non-root user to another. Signal handlers and spawned processes run at the privilege of the owning process, so if a process is running as root when a signal fires or a sub-process is executed, the signal handler or sub-process will operate with root privileges.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-269\nChildOf -> CWE-657\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** There is a close association with CWE-653 (Insufficient Separation of Privileges). CWE-653 is about providing separate components for each privilege; CWE-250 is about ensuring that each component has the least amount of privileges possible.\n\n**[Maintenance]** CWE-271, CWE-272, and CWE-250 are all closely related and possibly overlapping. CWE-271 is probably better suited as a category. Both CWE-272 and CWE-250 are in active use by the community. The \"least privilege\" phrase has multiple interpretations.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-4217:** FTP client program on a certain OS runs with setuid privileges and has a buffer overflow. Most clients do not need extra privileges, so an overflow is not a vulnerability for those clients.\n- **CVE-2008-1877:** Program runs with privileges and calls another program with the same privileges, which allows read of arbitrary files.\n- **CVE-2007-5159:** OS incorrectly installs a program with setuid privileges, allowing users to gain privileges.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with \"privilege escalation,\" which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** If an error or mistake allows privilege escalation, then use the CWE ID for that mistake. Avoid using CWE-269 when only phrases such as \"privilege escalation\" or \"gain privileges\" are available, as these indicate technical impact of the vulnerability - not the root cause weakness. If the root cause seems to be directly related to privileges, then examine the children of CWE-269 for additional hints, such as Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250) or Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-1555:** Terminal privileges are not reset when a user logs out.\n- **CVE-2001-1514:** Does not properly pass security context to child processes in certain cases, allows privilege escalation.\n- **CVE-2001-0128:** Does not properly compute roles.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAlthough this weakness can occur with any type of resource, it is frequently introduced when a product uses a directory search path to find executables or code libraries, but the path contains a directory that can be modified by an attacker, such as \"/tmp\" or the current working directory.\n\n\nIn Windows-based systems, when the LoadLibrary or LoadLibraryEx function is called with a DLL name that does not contain a fully qualified path, the function follows a search order that includes two path elements that might be uncontrolled:\n\n\n  - the directory from which the program has been loaded\n\n  - the current working directory\n\nIn some cases, the attack can be conducted remotely, such as when SMB or WebDAV network shares are used.\n\nOne or more locations in that path could include the Windows drive root or its subdirectories. This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory. In Windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled.\n\n\nIn some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element.\n\n\nIn software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository. This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDLL preloading: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.\nBinary planting: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.\nInsecure library loading: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.\nDependency confusion: As of February 2021, this term is used to describe CWE-427 in the context of managing installation of software package dependencies, in which attackers release packages on public sites where the names are the same as package names used by private repositories, and the search for the dependent package tries the public site first, downloading untrusted code. It may also be referred to as a \"substitution attack.\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-668\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Unlike untrusted search path (CWE-426), which inherently involves control over the definition of a control sphere (i.e., modification of a search path), this entry concerns a fixed control sphere in which some part of the sphere may be under attacker control (i.e., the search path cannot be modified by an attacker, but one element of the path can be under attacker control).\n\n**[Theoretical]** This weakness is not a clean fit under CWE-668 or CWE-610, which suggests that the control sphere model might need enhancement or clarification.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-25815:** chain: a change in an underlying package causes the gettext function to use implicit initialization with a hard-coded path (CWE-1419) under the user-writable C:\\ drive, introducing an untrusted search path element (CWE-427) that enables spoofing of messages.\n- **CVE-2022-4826:** Go-based git extension on Windows can search for and execute a malicious \"..exe\" in a repository because Go searches the current working directory if git.exe is not found in the PATH\n- **CVE-2020-26284:** A Static Site Generator built in Go, when running on Windows, searches the current working directory for a command, possibly allowing code execution using a malicious .exe or .bat file with the name being searched\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-403: Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere ('File Descriptor Leak')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA process does not close sensitive file descriptors before invoking a child process, which allows the child to perform unauthorized I/O operations using those descriptors.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a new process is forked or executed, the child process inherits any open file descriptors. When the child process has fewer privileges than the parent process, this might introduce a vulnerability if the child process can access the file descriptor but does not have the privileges to access the associated file.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nFile descriptor leak: While this issue is frequently called a file descriptor leak, the \"leak\" term is often used in two different ways - exposure of a resource, or consumption of a resource. Use of this term could cause confusion.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-402\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2003-0740:** Server leaks a privileged file descriptor, allowing the server to be hijacked.\n- **CVE-2004-1033:** File descriptor leak allows read of restricted files.\n- **CVE-2000-0094:** Access to restricted resource using modified file descriptor for stderr.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe PHP application receives input from an upstream component, but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the input before its usage in \"require,\" \"include,\" or similar functions.\n\n### Extended Description\nIn certain versions and configurations of PHP, this can allow an attacker to specify a URL to a remote location from which the product will obtain the code to execute. In other cases in association with path traversal, the attacker can specify a local file that may contain executable statements that can be parsed by PHP.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nRemote file include\nRFI: The Remote File Inclusion (RFI) acronym is often used by vulnerability researchers.\nLocal file inclusion: This term is frequently used in cases in which remote download is disabled, or when the first part of the filename is not under the attacker's control, which forces use of relative path traversal (CWE-23) attack techniques to access files that may contain previously-injected PHP code, such as web access logs.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-829\nCanPrecede -> CWE-94\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-426\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThis is frequently a functional consequence of other weaknesses. It is usually multi-factor with other factors (e.g. MAID), although not all inclusion bugs involve assumed-immutable data. Direct request weaknesses frequently play a role.\n\n\nCan overlap directory traversal in local inclusion problems.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2004-0285:** Modification of assumed-immutable configuration variable in include file allows file inclusion via direct request.\n- **CVE-2004-0030:** Modification of assumed-immutable configuration variable in include file allows file inclusion via direct request.\n- **CVE-2004-0068:** Modification of assumed-immutable configuration variable in include file allows file inclusion via direct request.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which \"permissions\" are not checked, which is an \"authorization\" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view.

It was fixed in version 0.6.2.\n*   The fix involves replacing `execlp` with `execve` and hardcoding the path to `seatd`, preventing environment variable manipulation.\n*   The SUID bit on `seatd-launch` is not set by default during installation, requiring an explicit action by the packager or user to create the vulnerability.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 426 | Untrusted Search Path | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.272 |\n| 2 | 73 | External Control of File Name or Path | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.205 |\n| 3 | 250 | Execution with Unnecessary Privileges | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.176 |\n| 4 | 269 | Improper Privilege Management | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.162 |\n| 5 | 427 | Uncontrolled Search Path Element | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.147 |\n| 6 | 403 | Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere ('File Descriptor Leak') | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.472 |\n| 7 | 98 | Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion') | Variant | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 732 | Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.141 |\n| 9 | 267 | Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.136 |\n| 10 | 204 | Observable Response Discrepancy | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.136 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product searches for critical resources using an externally-supplied search path that can point to resources that are not under the product's direct control.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis might allow attackers to execute their own programs, access unauthorized data files, or modify configuration in unexpected ways. If the product uses a search path to locate critical resources such as programs, then an attacker could modify that search path to point to a malicious program, which the targeted product would then execute. The problem extends to any type of critical resource that the product trusts.\n\n\nSome of the most common variants of untrusted search path are:\n\n\n  - In various UNIX and Linux-based systems, the PATH environment variable may be consulted to locate executable programs, and LD_PRELOAD may be used to locate a separate library.\n\n  - In various Microsoft-based systems, the PATH environment variable is consulted to locate a DLL, if the DLL is not found in other paths that appear earlier in the search order.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nUntrusted Path\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-668\nChildOf -> CWE-673\nPeerOf -> CWE-427\nPeerOf -> CWE-428\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1120:** Application relies on its PATH environment variable to find and execute program.\n- **CVE-2008-1810:** Database application relies on its PATH environment variable to find and execute program.\n- **CVE-2007-2027:** Chain: untrusted search path enabling resultant format string by loading malicious internationalization messages.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.\n\n\nPath manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:\n\n```\n\t\t1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.\n\t\t2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.\n```\nFor example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-610\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\nCanPrecede -> CWE-434\nCanPrecede -> CWE-59\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.\n\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThe external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.\n\n\nHowever, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.\n\n\nThe external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.\n- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an operation at a privilege level that is higher than the minimum level required, which creates new weaknesses or amplifies the consequences of other weaknesses.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nNew weaknesses can be exposed because running with extra privileges, such as root or Administrator, can disable the normal security checks being performed by the operating system or surrounding environment. Other pre-existing weaknesses can turn into security vulnerabilities if they occur while operating at raised privileges.\n\n\nPrivilege management functions can behave in some less-than-obvious ways, and they have different quirks on different platforms. These inconsistencies are particularly pronounced if you are transitioning from one non-root user to another. Signal handlers and spawned processes run at the privilege of the owning process, so if a process is running as root when a signal fires or a sub-process is executed, the signal handler or sub-process will operate with root privileges.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-269\nChildOf -> CWE-657\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** There is a close association with CWE-653 (Insufficient Separation of Privileges). CWE-653 is about providing separate components for each privilege; CWE-250 is about ensuring that each component has the least amount of privileges possible.\n\n**[Maintenance]** CWE-271, CWE-272, and CWE-250 are all closely related and possibly overlapping. CWE-271 is probably better suited as a category. Both CWE-272 and CWE-250 are in active use by the community. The \"least privilege\" phrase has multiple interpretations.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-4217:** FTP client program on a certain OS runs with setuid privileges and has a buffer overflow. Most clients do not need extra privileges, so an overflow is not a vulnerability for those clients.\n- **CVE-2008-1877:** Program runs with privileges and calls another program with the same privileges, which allows read of arbitrary files.\n- **CVE-2007-5159:** OS incorrectly installs a program with setuid privileges, allowing users to gain privileges.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with \"privilege escalation,\" which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** If an error or mistake allows privilege escalation, then use the CWE ID for that mistake. Avoid using CWE-269 when only phrases such as \"privilege escalation\" or \"gain privileges\" are available, as these indicate technical impact of the vulnerability - not the root cause weakness. If the root cause seems to be directly related to privileges, then examine the children of CWE-269 for additional hints, such as Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250) or Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-1555:** Terminal privileges are not reset when a user logs out.\n- **CVE-2001-1514:** Does not properly pass security context to child processes in certain cases, allows privilege escalation.\n- **CVE-2001-0128:** Does not properly compute roles.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAlthough this weakness can occur with any type of resource, it is frequently introduced when a product uses a directory search path to find executables or code libraries, but the path contains a directory that can be modified by an attacker, such as \"/tmp\" or the current working directory.\n\n\nIn Windows-based systems, when the LoadLibrary or LoadLibraryEx function is called with a DLL name that does not contain a fully qualified path, the function follows a search order that includes two path elements that might be uncontrolled:\n\n\n  - the directory from which the program has been loaded\n\n  - the current working directory\n\nIn some cases, the attack can be conducted remotely, such as when SMB or WebDAV network shares are used.\n\nOne or more locations in that path could include the Windows drive root or its subdirectories. This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory. In Windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled.\n\n\nIn some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element.\n\n\nIn software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository. This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDLL preloading: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.\nBinary planting: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.\nInsecure library loading: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.\nDependency confusion: As of February 2021, this term is used to describe CWE-427 in the context of managing installation of software package dependencies, in which attackers release packages on public sites where the names are the same as package names used by private repositories, and the search for the dependent package tries the public site first, downloading untrusted code. It may also be referred to as a \"substitution attack.\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-668\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Unlike untrusted search path (CWE-426), which inherently involves control over the definition of a control sphere (i.e., modification of a search path), this entry concerns a fixed control sphere in which some part of the sphere may be under attacker control (i.e., the search path cannot be modified by an attacker, but one element of the path can be under attacker control).\n\n**[Theoretical]** This weakness is not a clean fit under CWE-668 or CWE-610, which suggests that the control sphere model might need enhancement or clarification.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-25815:** chain: a change in an underlying package causes the gettext function to use implicit initialization with a hard-coded path (CWE-1419) under the user-writable C:\\ drive, introducing an untrusted search path element (CWE-427) that enables spoofing of messages.\n- **CVE-2022-4826:** Go-based git extension on Windows can search for and execute a malicious \"..exe\" in a repository because Go searches the current working directory if git.exe is not found in the PATH\n- **CVE-2020-26284:** A Static Site Generator built in Go, when running on Windows, searches the current working directory for a command, possibly allowing code execution using a malicious .exe or .bat file with the name being searched\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-403: Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere ('File Descriptor Leak')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA process does not close sensitive file descriptors before invoking a child process, which allows the child to perform unauthorized I/O operations using those descriptors.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a new process is forked or executed, the child process inherits any open file descriptors. When the child process has fewer privileges than the parent process, this might introduce a vulnerability if the child process can access the file descriptor but does not have the privileges to access the associated file.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nFile descriptor leak: While this issue is frequently called a file descriptor leak, the \"leak\" term is often used in two different ways - exposure of a resource, or consumption of a resource. Use of this term could cause confusion.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-402\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2003-0740:** Server leaks a privileged file descriptor, allowing the server to be hijacked.\n- **CVE-2004-1033:** File descriptor leak allows read of restricted files.\n- **CVE-2000-0094:** Access to restricted resource using modified file descriptor for stderr.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe PHP application receives input from an upstream component, but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the input before its usage in \"require,\" \"include,\" or similar functions.\n\n### Extended Description\nIn certain versions and configurations of PHP, this can allow an attacker to specify a URL to a remote location from which the product will obtain the code to execute. In other cases in association with path traversal, the attacker can specify a local file that may contain executable statements that can be parsed by PHP.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nRemote file include\nRFI: The Remote File Inclusion (RFI) acronym is often used by vulnerability researchers.\nLocal file inclusion: This term is frequently used in cases in which remote download is disabled, or when the first part of the filename is not under the attacker's control, which forces use of relative path traversal (CWE-23) attack techniques to access files that may contain previously-injected PHP code, such as web access logs.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-829\nCanPrecede -> CWE-94\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-426\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThis is frequently a functional consequence of other weaknesses. It is usually multi-factor with other factors (e.g. MAID), although not all inclusion bugs involve assumed-immutable data. Direct request weaknesses frequently play a role.\n\n\nCan overlap directory traversal in local inclusion problems.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2004-0285:** Modification of assumed-immutable configuration variable in include file allows file inclusion via direct request.\n- **CVE-2004-0030:** Modification of assumed-immutable configuration variable in include file allows file inclusion via direct request.\n- **CVE-2004-0068:** Modification of assumed-immutable configuration variable in include file allows file inclusion via direct request.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which \"permissions\" are not checked, which is an \"authorization\" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view.

It was fixed in version 0.6.2.\n*   The fix involves replacing `execlp` with `execve` and hardcoding the path to `seatd`, preventing environment variable manipulation.\n*   The SUID bit on `seatd-launch` is not set by default during installation, requiring an explicit action by the packager or user to create the vulnerability.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 426 | Untrusted Search Path | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.272 |\n| 2 | 73 | External Control of File Name or Path | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.205 |\n| 3 | 250 | Execution with Unnecessary Privileges | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.176 |\n| 4 | 269 | Improper Privilege Management | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.162 |\n| 5 | 427 | Uncontrolled Search Path Element | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.147 |\n| 6 | 403 | Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere ('File Descriptor Leak') | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.472 |\n| 7 | 98 | Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion') | Variant | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 732 | Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.141 |\n| 9 | 267 | Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.136 |\n| 10 | 204 | Observable Response Discrepancy | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.136 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product searches for critical resources using an externally-supplied search path that can point to resources that are not under the product's direct control.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis might allow attackers to execute their own programs, access unauthorized data files, or modify configuration in unexpected ways. If the product uses a search path to locate critical resources such as programs, then an attacker could modify that search path to point to a malicious program, which the targeted product would then execute. The problem extends to any type of critical resource that the product trusts.\n\n\nSome of the most common variants of untrusted search path are:\n\n\n  - In various UNIX and Linux-based systems, the PATH environment variable may be consulted to locate executable programs, and LD_PRELOAD may be used to locate a separate library.\n\n  - In various Microsoft-based systems, the PATH environment variable is consulted to locate a DLL, if the DLL is not found in other paths that appear earlier in the search order.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nUntrusted Path\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-668\nChildOf -> CWE-673\nPeerOf -> CWE-427\nPeerOf -> CWE-428\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1120:** Application relies on its PATH environment variable to find and execute program.\n- **CVE-2008-1810:** Database application relies on its PATH environment variable to find and execute program.\n- **CVE-2007-2027:** Chain: untrusted search path enabling resultant format string by loading malicious internationalization messages.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.\n\n\nPath manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:\n\n```\n\t\t1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.\n\t\t2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.\n```\nFor example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-610\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\nCanPrecede -> CWE-434\nCanPrecede -> CWE-59\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.\n\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThe external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.\n\n\nHowever, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.\n\n\nThe external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.\n- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an operation at a privilege level that is higher than the minimum level required, which creates new weaknesses or amplifies the consequences of other weaknesses.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nNew weaknesses can be exposed because running with extra privileges, such as root or Administrator, can disable the normal security checks being performed by the operating system or surrounding environment. Other pre-existing weaknesses can turn into security vulnerabilities if they occur while operating at raised privileges.\n\n\nPrivilege management functions can behave in some less-than-obvious ways, and they have different quirks on different platforms. These inconsistencies are particularly pronounced if you are transitioning from one non-root user to another. Signal handlers and spawned processes run at the privilege of the owning process, so if a process is running as root when a signal fires or a sub-process is executed, the signal handler or sub-process will operate with root privileges.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-269\nChildOf -> CWE-657\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** There is a close association with CWE-653 (Insufficient Separation of Privileges). CWE-653 is about providing separate components for each privilege; CWE-250 is about ensuring that each component has the least amount of privileges possible.\n\n**[Maintenance]** CWE-271, CWE-272, and CWE-250 are all closely related and possibly overlapping. CWE-271 is probably better suited as a category. Both CWE-272 and CWE-250 are in active use by the community. The \"least privilege\" phrase has multiple interpretations.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-4217:** FTP client program on a certain OS runs with setuid privileges and has a buffer overflow. Most clients do not need extra privileges, so an overflow is not a vulnerability for those clients.\n- **CVE-2008-1877:** Program runs with privileges and calls another program with the same privileges, which allows read of arbitrary files.\n- **CVE-2007-5159:** OS incorrectly installs a program with setuid privileges, allowing users to gain privileges.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with \"privilege escalation,\" which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** If an error or mistake allows privilege escalation, then use the CWE ID for that mistake. Avoid using CWE-269 when only phrases such as \"privilege escalation\" or \"gain privileges\" are available, as these indicate technical impact of the vulnerability - not the root cause weakness. If the root cause seems to be directly related to privileges, then examine the children of CWE-269 for additional hints, such as Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250) or Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-1555:** Terminal privileges are not reset when a user logs out.\n- **CVE-2001-1514:** Does not properly pass security context to child processes in certain cases, allows privilege escalation.\n- **CVE-2001-0128:** Does not properly compute roles.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAlthough this weakness can occur with any type of resource, it is frequently introduced when a product uses a directory search path to find executables or code libraries, but the path contains a directory that can be modified by an attacker, such as \"/tmp\" or the current working directory.\n\n\nIn Windows-based systems, when the LoadLibrary or LoadLibraryEx function is called with a DLL name that does not contain a fully qualified path, the function follows a search order that includes two path elements that might be uncontrolled:\n\n\n  - the directory from which the program has been loaded\n\n  - the current working directory\n\nIn some cases, the attack can be conducted remotely, such as when SMB or WebDAV network shares are used.\n\nOne or more locations in that path could include the Windows drive root or its subdirectories. This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory. In Windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled.\n\n\nIn some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element.\n\n\nIn software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository. This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDLL preloading: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.\nBinary planting: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.\nInsecure library loading: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.\nDependency confusion: As of February 2021, this term is used to describe CWE-427 in the context of managing installation of software package dependencies, in which attackers release packages on public sites where the names are the same as package names used by private repositories, and the search for the dependent package tries the public site first, downloading untrusted code. It may also be referred to as a \"substitution attack.\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-668\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Unlike untrusted search path (CWE-426), which inherently involves control over the definition of a control sphere (i.e., modification of a search path), this entry concerns a fixed control sphere in which some part of the sphere may be under attacker control (i.e., the search path cannot be modified by an attacker, but one element of the path can be under attacker control).\n\n**[Theoretical]** This weakness is not a clean fit under CWE-668 or CWE-610, which suggests that the control sphere model might need enhancement or clarification.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-25815:** chain: a change in an underlying package causes the gettext function to use implicit initialization with a hard-coded path (CWE-1419) under the user-writable C:\\ drive, introducing an untrusted search path element (CWE-427) that enables spoofing of messages.\n- **CVE-2022-4826:** Go-based git extension on Windows can search for and execute a malicious \"..exe\" in a repository because Go searches the current working directory if git.exe is not found in the PATH\n- **CVE-2020-26284:** A Static Site Generator built in Go, when running on Windows, searches the current working directory for a command, possibly allowing code execution using a malicious .exe or .bat file with the name being searched\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-403: Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere ('File Descriptor Leak')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA process does not close sensitive file descriptors before invoking a child process, which allows the child to perform unauthorized I/O operations using those descriptors.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a new process is forked or executed, the child process inherits any open file descriptors. When the child process has fewer privileges than the parent process, this might introduce a vulnerability if the child process can access the file descriptor but does not have the privileges to access the associated file.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nFile descriptor leak: While this issue is frequently called a file descriptor leak, the \"leak\" term is often used in two different ways - exposure of a resource, or consumption of a resource. Use of this term could cause confusion.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-402\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

In other cases in association with path traversal, the attacker can specify a local file that may contain executable statements that can be parsed by PHP.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nRemote file include\nRFI: The Remote File Inclusion (RFI) acronym is often used by vulnerability researchers.\nLocal file inclusion: This term is frequently used in cases in which remote download is disabled, or when the first part of the filename is not under the attacker's control, which forces use of relative path traversal (CWE-23) attack techniques to access files that may contain previously-injected PHP code, such as web access logs.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-829\nCanPrecede -> CWE-94\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-426\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThis is frequently a functional consequence of other weaknesses. It is usually multi-factor with other factors (e.g. MAID), although not all inclusion bugs involve assumed-immutable data. Direct request weaknesses frequently play a role.\n\n\nCan overlap directory traversal in local inclusion problems.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2004-0285:** Modification of assumed-immutable configuration variable in include file allows file inclusion via direct request.\n- **CVE-2004-0030:** Modification of assumed-immutable configuration variable in include file allows file inclusion via direct request.\n- **CVE-2004-0068:** Modification of assumed-immutable configuration variable in include file allows file inclusion via direct request.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which \"permissions\" are not checked, which is an \"authorization\" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view.
