The first one allows low-privileged users (including simple subscribers) to change the tawkto-embed-widget-page-id and tawkto-embed-widget-widget-id parameters. Any authenticated user can thus link the vulnerable website to their own Tawk.to instance. Consequently, they will be able to monitor the vulnerable website and interact with its visitors (receive contact messages, answer, ...).
