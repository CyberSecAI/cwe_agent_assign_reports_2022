When symlinks are present in a TAR archive, extraction can create arbitrary directories via .. traversal.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **impact:** create arbitrary directories via .. traversal\n- **product:** tar crate\n- **version:** before 0.4.36\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe vulnerability arises from how the `tar` crate handles symlinks during the unpacking process. Specifically, when a tar archive contains a symlink that points to a location outside the intended extraction directory (e.g., using \"..\"), the library creates the target directory structure *before* checking the validity of the path.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Path Traversal via Symlinks:** The core issue is the ability to use a symlink within the archive to force the creation of directories outside the intended target directory, leading to path traversal.\n*   **Premature Directory Creation:** The library creates the directory structure based on the path of the file *after* following the symlink, before verifying that the final path is within the target directory.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary Directory Creation:** Attackers can create directories at locations that are not within the scope of the intended extraction path. While the vulnerable code errors when trying to write the file to a place outside the target directory, the directories themselves are left behind. This can be used in combination with another vulnerability to write to files outside the target directory.\n*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While the provided content doesn't explicitly state a direct impact, creating arbitrary directories can be a crucial step in chaining vulnerabilities together. For example, an attacker might create a directory that will be targeted by another attack.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Malicious Tar Archive:** The attack vector involves a specially crafted tar archive that contains a symlink designed to point outside the expected extraction directory.\n*   **Unpack Function (`tar::Archive::unpack`)**: The vulnerability is triggered when an application uses the vulnerable version of the `tar` crate's `unpack` function to extract a malicious archive.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Ability to Craft Tar Archive:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a tar archive, injecting a malicious symlink.\n*   **Control over Archive Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious archive to a system that uses the vulnerable `tar` crate for unpacking.\n*   **No Special Privileges Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any special privileges.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is fixed in `tar` version 0.4.36 and later.\n*   The provided code snippet demonstrates a vulnerable tar archive that creates a symlink to `..` and then attempts to create a file in `symlink/exploit/foo/bar` to trigger the vulnerability.\n*   The CVSS score is 7.5 (High), indicating a significant risk to system integrity.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 59 | Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.088 |\n| 2 | 61 | UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following | Compound | Allowed | sparse | 0.069 |\n| 3 | 23 | Relative Path Traversal | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.066 |\n| 4 | 22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.062 |\n| 5 | 552 | Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.055 |\n| 6 | 24 | Path Traversal: '../filedir' | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.502 |\n| 7 | 182 | Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 908 | Use of Uninitialized Resource | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.054 |\n| 9 | 366 | Race Condition within a Thread | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.050 |\n| 10 | 833 | Deadlock | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.050 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\ninsecure temporary file: Some people use the phrase \"insecure temporary file\" when referring to a link following weakness, but other weaknesses can produce insecure temporary files without any symlink involvement at all.\nZip Slip: \"Zip slip\" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282].

There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine which weaknesses allow symlink following to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable file names might be intended functionality, but creation in a directory with insecure permissions might not.\n**Reasons:**\n- Other\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nSymlink vulnerabilities are regularly found in C and shell programs, but all programming languages can have this problem. Even shell programs are probably under-reported.\n\n\n\"Second-order symlink vulnerabilities\" may exist in programs that invoke other programs that follow symlinks. They are rarely reported but are likely to be fairly common when process invocation is used [REF-493].\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.\n- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.\n- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nZip Slip: \"Zip slip\" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282].

Probllama\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2019-20916:** Python package manager does not correctly restrict the filename specified in a Content-Disposition header, allowing arbitrary file read using path traversal sequences such as \"../\"\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDirectory traversal\nPath traversal: \"Path traversal\" is preferred over \"directory traversal,\" but both terms are attack-focused.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.\n\n**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.\n\n**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing \"/\" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nLike other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use \"directory traversal\" only to refer to the injection of \"..\" and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.\n\n\nOther variants like \"absolute pathname\" and \"drive letter\" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve \"..\" or equivalent.\n\n\n**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nIncomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that \"..\\\" is vulnerable, but not test \"../\" which may also be vulnerable.\n\n\nAny combination of directory separators (\"/\", \"\\\", etc.) and numbers of \".\" (e.g. \"....\") can produce unique variants; for example, the \"//../\" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a.

Applications may store sensitive files underneath this root without also using access control to limit which users may request those files, if any. Alternately, an application might package multiple files or directories into an archive file (e.g., ZIP or tar), but the application might not exclude sensitive files that are underneath those directories.\n\n\nIn cloud technologies and containers, this weakness might present itself in the form of misconfigured storage accounts that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-668\nChildOf -> CWE-668\nChildOf -> CWE-285\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDirectory traversal\nPath traversal: \"Path traversal\" is preferred over \"directory traversal,\" but both terms are attack-focused.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

For example, the product may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.\n\n**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.\n\n**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing \"/\" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nLike other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use \"directory traversal\" only to refer to the injection of \"..\" and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.\n\n\nOther variants like \"absolute pathname\" and \"drive letter\" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve \"..\" or equivalent.\n\n\n**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nIncomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that \"..\\\" is vulnerable, but not test \"../\" which may also be vulnerable.\n\n\nAny combination of directory separators (\"/\", \"\\\", etc.) and numbers of \".\" (e.g. \"....\") can produce unique variants; for example, the \"//../\" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325).

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nAn issue was discovered in the tar crate before 0.4.36 for Rust. When symlinks are present in a TAR archive, extraction can create arbitrary directories via .. traversal.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **impact:** create arbitrary directories via .. traversal\n- **product:** tar crate\n- **version:** before 0.4.36\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe vulnerability arises from how the `tar` crate handles symlinks during the unpacking process. Specifically, when a tar archive contains a symlink that points to a location outside the intended extraction directory (e.g., using \"..\"), the library creates the target directory structure *before* checking the validity of the path.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Path Traversal via Symlinks:** The core issue is the ability to use a symlink within the archive to force the creation of directories outside the intended target directory, leading to path traversal.\n*   **Premature Directory Creation:** The library creates the directory structure based on the path of the file *after* following the symlink, before verifying that the final path is within the target directory.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary Directory Creation:** Attackers can create directories at locations that are not within the scope of the intended extraction path. While the vulnerable code errors when trying to write the file to a place outside the target directory, the directories themselves are left behind. This can be used in combination with another vulnerability to write to files outside the target directory.\n*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While the provided content doesn't explicitly state a direct impact, creating arbitrary directories can be a crucial step in chaining vulnerabilities together. For example, an attacker might create a directory that will be targeted by another attack.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Malicious Tar Archive:** The attack vector involves a specially crafted tar archive that contains a symlink designed to point outside the expected extraction directory.\n*   **Unpack Function (`tar::Archive::unpack`)**: The vulnerability is triggered when an application uses the vulnerable version of the `tar` crate's `unpack` function to extract a malicious archive.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Ability to Craft Tar Archive:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a tar archive, injecting a malicious symlink.\n*   **Control over Archive Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious archive to a system that uses the vulnerable `tar` crate for unpacking.\n*   **No Special Privileges Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any special privileges.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is fixed in `tar` version 0.4.36 and later.\n*   The provided code snippet demonstrates a vulnerable tar archive that creates a symlink to `..` and then attempts to create a file in `symlink/exploit/foo/bar` to trigger the vulnerability.\n*   The CVSS score is 7.5 (High), indicating a significant risk to system integrity.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 59 | Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.088 |\n| 2 | 61 | UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following | Compound | Allowed | sparse | 0.069 |\n| 3 | 23 | Relative Path Traversal | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.066 |\n| 4 | 22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.062 |\n| 5 | 552 | Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.055 |\n| 6 | 24 | Path Traversal: '../filedir' | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.502 |\n| 7 | 182 | Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 908 | Use of Uninitialized Resource | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.054 |\n| 9 | 366 | Race Condition within a Thread | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.050 |\n| 10 | 833 | Deadlock | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.050 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\ninsecure temporary file: Some people use the phrase \"insecure temporary file\" when referring to a link following weakness, but other weaknesses can produce insecure temporary files without any symlink involvement at all.\nZip Slip: \"Zip slip\" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282].

Some people use \"directory traversal\" only to refer to the injection of \"..\" and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.\n\n\nOther variants like \"absolute pathname\" and \"drive letter\" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve \"..\" or equivalent.\n\n\n**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nIncomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that \"..\\\" is vulnerable, but not test \"../\" which may also be vulnerable.\n\n\nAny combination of directory separators (\"/\", \"\\\", etc.) and numbers of \".\" (e.g. \"....\") can produce unique variants; for example, the \"//../\" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the \"\\\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWeb servers, FTP servers, and similar servers may store a set of files underneath a \"root\" directory that is accessible to the server's users. Applications may store sensitive files underneath this root without also using access control to limit which users may request those files, if any. Alternately, an application might package multiple files or directories into an archive file (e.g., ZIP or tar), but the application might not exclude sensitive files that are underneath those directories.\n\n\nIn cloud technologies and containers, this weakness might present itself in the form of misconfigured storage accounts that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-668\nChildOf -> CWE-668\nChildOf -> CWE-285\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

In some cases, it is useful for bypassing protection schemes in environments for which \"/\" is supported but not the primary separator, such as Windows, which uses \"\\\" but can also accept \"/\".\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-23\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
