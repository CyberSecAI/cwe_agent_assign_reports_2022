A **missing permission check** in Nextcloud Deck before 1.2.9, 1.4.5 and 1.5.3 allows another authenticated users to access Deck cards of another user. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Deck App is upgraded to 1.2.9, 1.4.5 or 1.5.3. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **missing permission check**\n- **impact:** access Deck cards of another user\n- **attacker:** another authenticated users\n- **product:** Nextcloud Deck\n- **version:** before 1.2.9, 1.4.5 and 1.5.3\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39225:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a missing permission check within the Nextcloud Deck application's API. This oversight allows authenticated users to bypass intended access controls.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Missing authorization check:** The core weakness is the absence of a proper permission check before allowing access to Deck cards. This enables a user to access resources not meant for them.\n- **Inadequate Access Control:** The system fails to enforce the principle of least privilege, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can access and potentially view Deck cards belonging to other users. The specific information contained in these cards might vary, but it could expose private data.\n- **Confidentiality Breach:** The primary impact is a breach of confidentiality, as users can gain access to information that should only be visible to the owner of those cards.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability can be exploited through the Deck API, using a crafted request.\n- Since it's an authenticated user issue, an attacker needs a valid account on the Nextcloud instance to exploit this.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker must be an authenticated user within the Nextcloud instance. They don't need special privileges, only a valid user account.\n- The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the Deck API.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability was present in Nextcloud Deck versions prior to 1.2.9, 1.4.5, and 1.5.3.\n- The fix involves adding the missing permission check to ensure that only authorized users can access Deck cards.\n- The issue was reported through HackerOne.\n\nThe provided content contains more detail than the official CVE description, including the affected versions and the fix details.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 209 | Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.450 |\n| 2 | 862 | Missing Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.433 |\n| 3 | 639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.400 |\n| 4 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.383 |\n| 5 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.368 |\n| 6 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | dense | 0.500 |\n| 7 | 226 | Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 295 | Improper Certificate Validation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.359 |\n| 9 | 532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.358 |\n| 10 | 93 | Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.350 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThe sensitive information may be valuable information on its own (such as a password), or it may be useful for launching other, more serious attacks. The error message may be created in different ways:\n\n\n  - self-generated: the source code explicitly constructs the error message and delivers it\n\n  - externally-generated: the external environment, such as a language interpreter, handles the error and constructs its own message, whose contents are not under direct control by the programmer\n\nAn attacker may use the contents of error messages to help launch another, more focused attack. For example, an attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) might yield the full pathname of the installed application. In turn, this could be used to select the proper number of \"..\" sequences to navigate to the targeted file. An attack using SQL injection (CWE-89) might not initially succeed, but an error message could reveal the malformed query, which would expose query logic and possibly even passwords or other sensitive information used within the query.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nChildOf -> CWE-755\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInsecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The \"Insecure Direct Object Reference\" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.\nBroken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.\nHorizontal Authorization: \"Horizontal Authorization\" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-863\nChildOf -> CWE-863\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-36539:** An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-209\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-202\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen resources are released, they can be made available for reuse. For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.\n\n\nEven when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.\n\n\nThis weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-459\nChildOf -> CWE-212\nCanPrecede -> CWE-201\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).\n\n**[Maintenance]** This entry needs modification to clarify the differences with CWE-212. The description also combines two problems that are distinct from the CWE research perspective: the inadvertent transfer of information to another sphere, and improper initialization/shutdown. Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.\n\n**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release\n- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.\n- **CVE-2003-0291:** router does not clear information from DHCP packets that have been previously used\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client. The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nPeerOf -> CWE-322\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-12496:** A Go framework for robotics, drones, and IoT devices skips verification of root CA certificates by default.\n- **CVE-2014-1266:** chain: incorrect \"goto\" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple \"goto fail\" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).\n- **CVE-2021-22909:** Chain: router's firmware update procedure uses curl with \"-k\" (insecure) option that disables certificate validation (CWE-295), allowing adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) compromise with a malicious firmware image (CWE-494).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product writes sensitive information to a log file.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-538\nChildOf -> CWE-200\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.\n\n\nEven when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.\n\n\nThis weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-459\nChildOf -> CWE-212\nCanPrecede -> CWE-201\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).\n\n**[Maintenance]** This entry needs modification to clarify the differences with CWE-212. The description also combines two problems that are distinct from the CWE research perspective: the inadvertent transfer of information to another sphere, and improper initialization/shutdown. Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.\n\n**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release\n- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.\n- **CVE-2003-0291:** router does not clear information from DHCP packets that have been previously used\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client.

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nNextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform. A **missing permission check** in Nextcloud Deck before 1.2.9, 1.4.5 and 1.5.3 allows another authenticated users to access Deck cards of another user. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Deck App is upgraded to 1.2.9, 1.4.5 or 1.5.3. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **missing permission check**\n- **impact:** access Deck cards of another user\n- **attacker:** another authenticated users\n- **product:** Nextcloud Deck\n- **version:** before 1.2.9, 1.4.5 and 1.5.3\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39225:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a missing permission check within the Nextcloud Deck application's API. This oversight allows authenticated users to bypass intended access controls.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Missing authorization check:** The core weakness is the absence of a proper permission check before allowing access to Deck cards. This enables a user to access resources not meant for them.\n- **Inadequate Access Control:** The system fails to enforce the principle of least privilege, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can access and potentially view Deck cards belonging to other users. The specific information contained in these cards might vary, but it could expose private data.\n- **Confidentiality Breach:** The primary impact is a breach of confidentiality, as users can gain access to information that should only be visible to the owner of those cards.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability can be exploited through the Deck API, using a crafted request.\n- Since it's an authenticated user issue, an attacker needs a valid account on the Nextcloud instance to exploit this.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker must be an authenticated user within the Nextcloud instance. They don't need special privileges, only a valid user account.\n- The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the Deck API.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability was present in Nextcloud Deck versions prior to 1.2.9, 1.4.5, and 1.5.3.\n- The fix involves adding the missing permission check to ensure that only authorized users can access Deck cards.\n- The issue was reported through HackerOne.\n\nThe provided content contains more detail than the official CVE description, including the affected versions and the fix details.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 209 | Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.450 |\n| 2 | 862 | Missing Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.433 |\n| 3 | 639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.400 |\n| 4 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.383 |\n| 5 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.368 |\n| 6 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | dense | 0.500 |\n| 7 | 226 | Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 295 | Improper Certificate Validation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.359 |\n| 9 | 532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.358 |\n| 10 | 93 | Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.350 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThe sensitive information may be valuable information on its own (such as a password), or it may be useful for launching other, more serious attacks. The error message may be created in different ways:\n\n\n  - self-generated: the source code explicitly constructs the error message and delivers it\n\n  - externally-generated: the external environment, such as a language interpreter, handles the error and constructs its own message, whose contents are not under direct control by the programmer\n\nAn attacker may use the contents of error messages to help launch another, more focused attack. For example, an attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) might yield the full pathname of the installed application. In turn, this could be used to select the proper number of \"..\" sequences to navigate to the targeted file. An attack using SQL injection (CWE-89) might not initially succeed, but an error message could reveal the malformed query, which would expose query logic and possibly even passwords or other sensitive information used within the query.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nChildOf -> CWE-755\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen resources are released, they can be made available for reuse. For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.\n\n\nEven when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.\n\n\nThis weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-459\nChildOf -> CWE-212\nCanPrecede -> CWE-201\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).\n\n**[Maintenance]** This entry needs modification to clarify the differences with CWE-212. The description also combines two problems that are distinct from the CWE research perspective: the inadvertent transfer of information to another sphere, and improper initialization/shutdown. Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.\n\n**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release\n- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.\n- **CVE-2003-0291:** router does not clear information from DHCP packets that have been previously used\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client. The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nPeerOf -> CWE-322\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
