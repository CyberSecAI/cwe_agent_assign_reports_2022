Zephyr versions >= >=2.4.0 contain Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow (CWE-680). For more information, see https//github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/security/advisories/GHSA-w44j-66g7-xw99\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **Integer Underflow**\n- **impact:** integer overflow and buffer overflow\n- **vector:** IEEE 802154 Fragment Reassembly Header Removal\n- **product:** Zephyr\n- **version:** >= 2.4.0\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\n- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer underflow due to incomplete validation of the minimum IEEE 802154 fragment size. Specifically, the length of the data payload itself is not validated, and during header stripping, the size of the header is assumed from the fragment type without validating the actual fragment size.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer underflow leading to an out-of-bounds write. The vulnerability lies in the `fragment_remove_headers` function where `memmove` is used with a potentially underflown size, causing a large out-of-bounds write in a network buffer.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** At minimum, a denial of service (firmware crash). Potentially, remote code execution (RCE) due to the resulting memory corruption on the board. The provided proof-of-concept crashes in the kernel function `z_time_slice` because of the kernel struct `z_kernel` being corrupted.\n- **Attack vectors:** Exploitable via network traffic containing malicious IEEE 802154 fragments. An attacker would need to send specially crafted fragments to the vulnerable device.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to send IEEE 802154 packets to the vulnerable device (Adjacent network). The attack complexity is rated as high, suggesting that crafting the malicious packets may require some specific knowledge. No privileges or user interaction is needed.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The provided document provides more details about the vulnerability than the official CVE description, which is a placeholder. The document details the vulnerable code path and provides a fix.\n- The fix includes a size validation before adding a fragment to the cache to ensure the fragment can at least hold its header.\n- CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 191 | Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound) | Base | Allowed | alternate_terms | 1.000 |\n| 2 | 130 | Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.290 |\n| 3 | 588 | Attempt to Access Child of a Non-structure Pointer | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.260 |\n| 4 | 694 | Use of Multiple Resources with Duplicate Identifier | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.258 |\n| 5 | 1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.234 |\n| 6 | 680 | Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow | Compound | Discouraged | dense | 0.620 |\n| 7 | 805 | Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 703 | Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions | Pillar | Discouraged | sparse | 0.222 |\n| 9 | 122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.217 |\n| 10 | 124 | Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.209 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis can happen in signed and unsigned cases.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInteger underflow: \n\n\"Integer underflow\" is sometimes used to identify signedness errors in which an originally positive number becomes negative as a result of subtraction. However, there are cases of bad subtraction in which unsigned integers are involved, so it's not always a signedness issue.\n\n\n\"Integer underflow\" is occasionally used to describe array index errors in which the index is negative.\n\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

One of the possible motives for doing so is to pass in arbitrarily large input to the application. Another possible motivation is the modification of application state by including invalid data for subsequent properties of the application. Such weaknesses commonly lead to attacks such as buffer overflows and execution of arbitrary code.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nlength manipulation\nlength tampering\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-240\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-805\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

It could be argued that even \"normal\" weaknesses such as buffer overflows involve unusual or exceptional conditions. In that sense, this might be an inherent aspect of most other weaknesses within CWE, similar to API Abuse (CWE-227) and Indicator of Poor Code Quality (CWE-398). However, this entry is currently intended to unify disparate concepts that do not have other places within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **[REF-1374]:** Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)\n- **CVE-2022-22224:** Chain: an operating system does not properly process malformed Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Type/Length/Value Identifiers (TLV) (CWE-703), which can cause the process to enter an infinite loop (CWE-835)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-788\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis typically occurs when a pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nbuffer underrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term \"buffer underrun\". \"Buffer underflow\" is more commonly used, although both terms are also sometimes used to describe a buffer under-read (CWE-127).\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-786\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\n**Integer Underflow** in Zephyr in IEEE 802154 Fragment Reassembly Header Removal. Zephyr versions >= >=2.4.0 contain Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow (CWE-680). For more information, see https//github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/security/advisories/GHSA-w44j-66g7-xw99\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **Integer Underflow**\n- **impact:** integer overflow and buffer overflow\n- **vector:** IEEE 802154 Fragment Reassembly Header Removal\n- **product:** Zephyr\n- **version:** >= 2.4.0\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\n- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer underflow due to incomplete validation of the minimum IEEE 802154 fragment size. Specifically, the length of the data payload itself is not validated, and during header stripping, the size of the header is assumed from the fragment type without validating the actual fragment size.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer underflow leading to an out-of-bounds write. The vulnerability lies in the `fragment_remove_headers` function where `memmove` is used with a potentially underflown size, causing a large out-of-bounds write in a network buffer.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** At minimum, a denial of service (firmware crash). Potentially, remote code execution (RCE) due to the resulting memory corruption on the board. The provided proof-of-concept crashes in the kernel function `z_time_slice` because of the kernel struct `z_kernel` being corrupted.\n- **Attack vectors:** Exploitable via network traffic containing malicious IEEE 802154 fragments. An attacker would need to send specially crafted fragments to the vulnerable device.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to send IEEE 802154 packets to the vulnerable device (Adjacent network). The attack complexity is rated as high, suggesting that crafting the malicious packets may require some specific knowledge. No privileges or user interaction is needed.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The provided document provides more details about the vulnerability than the official CVE description, which is a placeholder. The document details the vulnerable code path and provides a fix.\n- The fix includes a size validation before adding a fragment to the cache to ensure the fragment can at least hold its header.\n- CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 191 | Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound) | Base | Allowed | alternate_terms | 1.000 |\n| 2 | 130 | Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.290 |\n| 3 | 588 | Attempt to Access Child of a Non-structure Pointer | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.260 |\n| 4 | 694 | Use of Multiple Resources with Duplicate Identifier | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.258 |\n| 5 | 1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.234 |\n| 6 | 680 | Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow | Compound | Discouraged | dense | 0.620 |\n| 7 | 805 | Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 703 | Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions | Pillar | Discouraged | sparse | 0.222 |\n| 9 | 122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.217 |\n| 10 | 124 | Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.209 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis can happen in signed and unsigned cases.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInteger underflow: \n\n\"Integer underflow\" is sometimes used to identify signedness errors in which an originally positive number becomes negative as a result of subtraction. However, there are cases of bad subtraction in which unsigned integers are involved, so it's not always a signedness issue.\n\n\n\"Integer underflow\" is occasionally used to describe array index errors in which the index is negative.\n\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

One of the possible motives for doing so is to pass in arbitrarily large input to the application. Another possible motivation is the modification of application state by including invalid data for subsequent properties of the application. Such weaknesses commonly lead to attacks such as buffer overflows and execution of arbitrary code.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nlength manipulation\nlength tampering\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-240\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-805\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
