This could lead to local information disclosure with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product AndroidVersions Android-10 Android-11 Android-12Android ID A-183612370\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **missing permission check**\n- **impact:** retrieve long term identifier\n- **product:** Android\n- **version:** 10, 11, 12\n- **component:** getAllSubInfoList of SubscriptionController.java\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0643:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability lies in the `SubscriptionManager.getAllActiveSubscriptionInfoList` API.\n- This API, when called by apps without the `READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE` permission, would return the IMEI, IMSI, and other identifiers of SIM cards.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows applications with normal permissions to access SIM card identifiers that should be protected by a privileged permission. This allows access to information that could be used to track users across devices.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- A malicious application with regular permissions can gain access to sensitive device identifiers such as ICCID, IMEI, and IMSI of SIM cards without requiring the `READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE` permission.\n- This information disclosure could be leveraged to track users, correlate data across devices and potentially cause privacy violations.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- A local malicious application installed on an Android device.\n- The attacker does not require any special privileges other than the ability to install an application.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to have an application installed on a target device.\n- No other special capabilities or permissions are required besides the standard application installation capabilities.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The fix for this vulnerability includes filtering device identifiers from the `SubscriptionInfo` when the caller doesn't have the necessary permissions. Specifically, device identifiers like IMEI and IMSI are removed when the calling app does not hold the `READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE` permission.\n- The provided commit message from the AOSP source code provides more context about the nature of the vulnerability and how it was addressed. The commit message states: \"filter deviceIdentifiers for subscriptionInfo if callers without perm. Fix a security issue that app can read iccid of sim card(s) without requiring READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE permission when calling hidden API SubscriptionManager.getAllActiveSubscriptionInfoList. Apply deviceIdentifier filter to remove those info if the caller does not have proper permissions.\"\n\n- This vulnerability was classified as **High severity** as it allows for potential privacy violations by enabling unauthorized access to device identifying information.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 862 | Missing Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.505 |\n| 2 | 1021 | Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.427 |\n| 3 | 927 | Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.413 |\n| 4 | 514 | Covert Channel | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.412 |\n| 5 | 223 | Omission of Security-relevant Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.407 |\n| 6 | 925 | Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.553 |\n| 7 | 205 | Observable Behavioral Discrepancy | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 941 | Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.402 |\n| 9 | 732 | Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.386 |\n| 10 | 665 | Improper Initialization | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.385 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community.

This can allow untrusted applications to obtain sensitive data. There are two variations on the standard broadcast intent, ordered and sticky.\n\n\nOrdered broadcast intents are delivered to a series of registered receivers in order of priority as declared by the Receivers. A malicious receiver can give itself a high priority and cause a denial of service by stopping the broadcast from propagating further down the chain. There is also the possibility of malicious data modification, as a receiver may also alter the data within the Intent before passing it on to the next receiver. The downstream components have no way of asserting that the data has not been altered earlier in the chain.\n\n\nSticky broadcast intents remain accessible after the initial broadcast. An old sticky intent will be broadcast again to any new receivers that register for it in the future, greatly increasing the chances of information exposure over time. Also, sticky broadcasts cannot be protected by permissions that may apply to other kinds of intents.\n\n\nIn addition, any broadcast intent may include a URI that references data that the receiving component does not normally have the privileges to access. The sender of the intent can include special privileges that grant the receiver read or write access to the specific URI included in the intent. A malicious receiver that intercepts this intent will also gain those privileges and be able to read or write the resource at the specified URI.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

However, when an application registers to receive these implicit system intents, it is also registered to receive any explicit intents. While a malicious application cannot send an implicit system intent, it can send an explicit intent to the target application, which may assume that any received intent is a valid implicit system intent and not an explicit intent from another application. This may lead to unintended behavior.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nIntent Spoofing\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-940\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Otherwise, attackers could use knowledge of these internal operations to simplify or optimize their attack. In some cases, behavioral discrepancies can be used by attackers to form a side channel.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-203\nCanPrecede -> CWE-514\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-0208:** Product modifies TCP/IP stack and ICMP error messages in unusual ways that show the product is in use.\n- **CVE-2004-2252:** Behavioral infoleak by responding to SYN-FIN packets.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAttackers at the destination may be able to spoof trusted servers to steal data or cause a denial of service.\n\n\nThere are at least two distinct weaknesses that can cause the product to communicate with an unintended destination:\n\n\n  - If the product allows an attacker to control which destination is specified, then the attacker can cause it to connect to an untrusted or malicious destination. For example, because UDP is a connectionless protocol, UDP packets can be spoofed by specifying a false source address in the packet; when the server receives the packet and sends a reply, it will specify a destination by using the source of the incoming packet - i.e., the false source. The server can then be tricked into sending traffic to the wrong host, which is effective for hiding the real source of an attack and for conducting a distributed denial of service (DDoS). As another example, server-side request forgery (SSRF) and XML External Entity (XXE) can be used to trick a server into making outgoing requests to hosts that cannot be directly accessed by the attacker due to firewall restrictions.\n\n  - If the product incorrectly specifies the destination, then an attacker who can control this destination might be able to spoof trusted servers. While the most common occurrence is likely due to misconfiguration by an administrator, this can be resultant from other weaknesses. For example, the product might incorrectly parse an e-mail or IP address and send sensitive data to an unintended destination. As another example, an Android application may use a \"sticky broadcast\" to communicate with a receiver for a particular application, but since sticky broadcasts can be processed by *any* receiver, this can allow a malicious application to access restricted data that was only intended for a different application.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-923\nCanPrecede -> CWE-406\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2013-5211:** composite: NTP feature generates large responses (high amplification factor) with spoofed UDP source addresses.\n- **CVE-1999-0513:** Classic \"Smurf\" attack, using spoofed ICMP packets to broadcast addresses.\n- **CVE-1999-1379:** DNS query with spoofed source address causes more traffic to be returned to spoofed address than was sent by the attacker.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which \"permissions\" are not checked, which is an \"authorization\" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions for files under the \"Program Files\" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.\n- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis can have security implications when the associated resource is expected to have certain properties or values, such as a variable that determines whether a user has been authenticated or not.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-1471:** chain: an invalid value prevents a library file from being included, skipping initialization of key variables, leading to resultant eval injection.\n- **CVE-2008-3637:** Improper error checking in protection mechanism produces an uninitialized variable, allowing security bypass and code execution.\n- **CVE-2008-4197:** Use of uninitialized memory may allow code execution.\n\n Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-754 CWE-653 CWE-285 CWE-923 CWE-863 CWE-927 CWE-280 CWE-665 CWE-941",

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nIn getAllSubInfoList of SubscriptionController.java, there is a possible way to retrieve a long term identifier without the correct permissions due to a **missing permission check**. This could lead to local information disclosure with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product AndroidVersions Android-10 Android-11 Android-12Android ID A-183612370\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **missing permission check**\n- **impact:** retrieve long term identifier\n- **product:** Android\n- **version:** 10, 11, 12\n- **component:** getAllSubInfoList of SubscriptionController.java\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0643:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability lies in the `SubscriptionManager.getAllActiveSubscriptionInfoList` API.\n- This API, when called by apps without the `READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE` permission, would return the IMEI, IMSI, and other identifiers of SIM cards.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows applications with normal permissions to access SIM card identifiers that should be protected by a privileged permission. This allows access to information that could be used to track users across devices.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- A malicious application with regular permissions can gain access to sensitive device identifiers such as ICCID, IMEI, and IMSI of SIM cards without requiring the `READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE` permission.\n- This information disclosure could be leveraged to track users, correlate data across devices and potentially cause privacy violations.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- A local malicious application installed on an Android device.\n- The attacker does not require any special privileges other than the ability to install an application.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to have an application installed on a target device.\n- No other special capabilities or permissions are required besides the standard application installation capabilities.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The fix for this vulnerability includes filtering device identifiers from the `SubscriptionInfo` when the caller doesn't have the necessary permissions. Specifically, device identifiers like IMEI and IMSI are removed when the calling app does not hold the `READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE` permission.\n- The provided commit message from the AOSP source code provides more context about the nature of the vulnerability and how it was addressed. The commit message states: \"filter deviceIdentifiers for subscriptionInfo if callers without perm. Fix a security issue that app can read iccid of sim card(s) without requiring READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE permission when calling hidden API SubscriptionManager.getAllActiveSubscriptionInfoList. Apply deviceIdentifier filter to remove those info if the caller does not have proper permissions.\"\n\n- This vulnerability was classified as **High severity** as it allows for potential privacy violations by enabling unauthorized access to device identifying information.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 862 | Missing Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.505 |\n| 2 | 1021 | Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.427 |\n| 3 | 927 | Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.413 |\n| 4 | 514 | Covert Channel | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.412 |\n| 5 | 223 | Omission of Security-relevant Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.407 |\n| 6 | 925 | Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.553 |\n| 7 | 205 | Observable Behavioral Discrepancy | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 941 | Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.402 |\n| 9 | 732 | Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.386 |\n| 10 | 665 | Improper Initialization | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.385 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community.

This can allow untrusted applications to obtain sensitive data. There are two variations on the standard broadcast intent, ordered and sticky.\n\n\nOrdered broadcast intents are delivered to a series of registered receivers in order of priority as declared by the Receivers. A malicious receiver can give itself a high priority and cause a denial of service by stopping the broadcast from propagating further down the chain. There is also the possibility of malicious data modification, as a receiver may also alter the data within the Intent before passing it on to the next receiver. The downstream components have no way of asserting that the data has not been altered earlier in the chain.\n\n\nSticky broadcast intents remain accessible after the initial broadcast. An old sticky intent will be broadcast again to any new receivers that register for it in the future, greatly increasing the chances of information exposure over time. Also, sticky broadcasts cannot be protected by permissions that may apply to other kinds of intents.\n\n\nIn addition, any broadcast intent may include a URI that references data that the receiving component does not normally have the privileges to access. The sender of the intent can include special privileges that grant the receiver read or write access to the specific URI included in the intent. A malicious receiver that intercepts this intent will also gain those privileges and be able to read or write the resource at the specified URI.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions for files under the \"Program Files\" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.\n- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis can have security implications when the associated resource is expected to have certain properties or values, such as a variable that determines whether a user has been authenticated or not.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-1471:** chain: an invalid value prevents a library file from being included, skipping initialization of key variables, leading to resultant eval injection.\n- **CVE-2008-3637:** Improper error checking in protection mechanism produces an uninitialized variable, allowing security bypass and code execution.\n- **CVE-2008-4197:** Use of uninitialized memory may allow code execution.\n\n Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-754 CWE-653 CWE-285 CWE-923 CWE-863 CWE-927 CWE-280 CWE-665 CWE-941",
