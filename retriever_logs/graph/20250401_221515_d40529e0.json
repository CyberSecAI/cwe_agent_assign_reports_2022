This bug can lead to a memory safety violation due to an unmet safety requirement for the TrustedRandomAccess trait.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **implementation calls __iterator_get_unchecked() for the same index more than once when nested**\n- **impact:** memory safety violation\n- **product:** Rust standard library\n- **version:** before 1.51.0\n- **component:** Zip implementation\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28877:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability arises from an incorrect composition of the `TrustedRandomAccess` specialization in nested `iter::Zip` adapters. When a `Zip` adapter is partially consumed and then wrapped in another `Zip` adapter, the outer adapter may return elements that should have already been consumed. This is because the `TrustedRandomAccess` optimization does not correctly track offsets after partial consumption in nested `Zip` iterators.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Incorrect `TrustedRandomAccess` specialization:** The `TrustedRandomAccess` trait is not correctly implemented for nested `Zip` iterators, leading to incorrect offset calculations after partial consumption of the inner iterator.\n- **Potential for logic errors:**  The incorrect offset calculation can lead to iterators returning the wrong elements or returning elements multiple times, causing unexpected behavior.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\nThe immediate impact of this vulnerability is incorrect iterator behavior, potentially leading to:\n\n*   **Incorrect data processing:** When nested `Zip` iterators are used, and one of them is partially consumed, it might result in incorrect data being returned by the outer iterator.\n*   **Possible performance issues:** The initial report also suggests potential performance impacts, if the optimizer is tripped up by the addition.\n*   **Logic errors:** The unexpected behavior can cause logic errors that can be difficult to debug.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\nThe primary attack vector involves using nested `Zip` iterators where the inner iterator is partially consumed before being used in the outer `Zip`.  This is a logical bug rather than a traditional attack vector.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\nAn attacker would need to control or influence the logic using `Zip` iterators in Rust code, and specifically trigger the situation where a partially consumed `Zip` adapter is nested within another. No specific privileges or network access are required for exploitation, as this is a flaw within the logic of the Rust standard library implementation.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was present in Rust for years before being discovered.\n*   The fix was implemented by correcting the `TrustedRandomAccess` specialization.\n*   The fix was included in the Rust 1.51.0 release.\n*   The provided GitHub pull request ([#80670](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80670)) contains details about the vulnerability and its fix.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.368 |\n| 2 | 755 | Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.361 |\n| 3 | 787 | Out-of-bounds Write | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.283 |\n| 4 | 367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.276 |\n| 5 | 409 | Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification) | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.274 |\n| 6 | 606 | Unchecked Input for Loop Condition | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.435 |\n| 7 | 825 | Expired Pointer Dereference | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 125 | Out-of-bounds Read | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.271 |\n| 9 | 833 | Deadlock | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.270 |\n| 10 | 674 | Uncontrolled Recursion | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.270 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.\n\n**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of \"memory corruption\" or \"memory safety.\" As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2008-5013:** access of expired memory address leads to arbitrary code execution\n- **CVE-2010-3257:** stale pointer issue leads to denial of service and possibly other consequences\n- **CVE-2008-0062:** Chain: a message having an unknown message type may cause a reference to uninitialized memory resulting in a null pointer dereference (CWE-476) or dangling pointer (CWE-825), possibly crashing the system or causing heap corruption.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOOB read: Shorthand for \"Out of bounds\" read\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nIn the standard library in Rust before 1.51.0, the Zip **implementation calls __iterator_get_unchecked() for the same index more than once when nested**. This bug can lead to a memory safety violation due to an unmet safety requirement for the TrustedRandomAccess trait.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **implementation calls __iterator_get_unchecked() for the same index more than once when nested**\n- **impact:** memory safety violation\n- **product:** Rust standard library\n- **version:** before 1.51.0\n- **component:** Zip implementation\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28877:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability arises from an incorrect composition of the `TrustedRandomAccess` specialization in nested `iter::Zip` adapters. When a `Zip` adapter is partially consumed and then wrapped in another `Zip` adapter, the outer adapter may return elements that should have already been consumed. This is because the `TrustedRandomAccess` optimization does not correctly track offsets after partial consumption in nested `Zip` iterators.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Incorrect `TrustedRandomAccess` specialization:** The `TrustedRandomAccess` trait is not correctly implemented for nested `Zip` iterators, leading to incorrect offset calculations after partial consumption of the inner iterator.\n- **Potential for logic errors:**  The incorrect offset calculation can lead to iterators returning the wrong elements or returning elements multiple times, causing unexpected behavior.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\nThe immediate impact of this vulnerability is incorrect iterator behavior, potentially leading to:\n\n*   **Incorrect data processing:** When nested `Zip` iterators are used, and one of them is partially consumed, it might result in incorrect data being returned by the outer iterator.\n*   **Possible performance issues:** The initial report also suggests potential performance impacts, if the optimizer is tripped up by the addition.\n*   **Logic errors:** The unexpected behavior can cause logic errors that can be difficult to debug.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\nThe primary attack vector involves using nested `Zip` iterators where the inner iterator is partially consumed before being used in the outer `Zip`.  This is a logical bug rather than a traditional attack vector.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\nAn attacker would need to control or influence the logic using `Zip` iterators in Rust code, and specifically trigger the situation where a partially consumed `Zip` adapter is nested within another. No specific privileges or network access are required for exploitation, as this is a flaw within the logic of the Rust standard library implementation.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was present in Rust for years before being discovered.\n*   The fix was implemented by correcting the `TrustedRandomAccess` specialization.\n*   The fix was included in the Rust 1.51.0 release.\n*   The provided GitHub pull request ([#80670](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80670)) contains details about the vulnerability and its fix.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.368 |\n| 2 | 755 | Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.361 |\n| 3 | 787 | Out-of-bounds Write | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.283 |\n| 4 | 367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.276 |\n| 5 | 409 | Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification) | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.274 |\n| 6 | 606 | Unchecked Input for Loop Condition | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.435 |\n| 7 | 825 | Expired Pointer Dereference | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 125 | Out-of-bounds Read | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.271 |\n| 9 | 833 | Deadlock | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.270 |\n| 10 | 674 | Uncontrolled Recursion | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.270 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nBuffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean \"write past the end of a buffer,\" whereas others use the same term to mean \"any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer.\" Others could mean \"any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write.\" Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.\nbuffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term \"buffer overrun,\" but most people use \"buffer overflow.\" See the alternate term for \"buffer overflow\" for context.\nmemory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the \"memory safety\" term.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-118\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nIt is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-703\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1476:** A bug in some Intel Pentium processors allow DoS (hang) via an invalid \"CMPXCHG8B\" instruction, causing a deadlock\n- **CVE-2009-2857:** OS deadlock\n- **CVE-2009-1961:** OS deadlock involving 3 separate functions\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nStack Exhaustion\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-834\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-1285:** Deeply nested arrays trigger stack exhaustion.\n- **CVE-2007-3409:** Self-referencing pointers create infinite loop and resultant stack exhaustion.\n- **CVE-2016-10707:** Javascript application accidentally changes input in a way that prevents a recursive call from detecting an exit condition.\n\n Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-667 CWE-754 CWE-823 CWE-404 CWE-125 CWE-367 CWE-190 CWE-789 CWE-226 CWE-119",
