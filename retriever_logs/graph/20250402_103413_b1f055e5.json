A specially-crafted .dwg file can lead to a **heap buffer overflow**. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **weakness:** **heap buffer overflow**\n- **impact:** code execution\n- **vector:** specially-crafted .dwg file\n- **product:** LibreCad libdxfrw\n- **version:** 2.2.0-rc2-19-ge02f3580\n- **component:** dwgCompressorcopyCompBytes21 functionality\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21899\n\n**Description:** A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `dwgCompressor::copyCompBytes21` function of LibreCad's libdxfrw library. This vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted .dwg file.\n\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking within the `copyCompBytes21` function. Specifically, the function copies data from a compressed buffer (`cbuf`) to a destination buffer (`dbuf`) without verifying if the destination index (`dix`) remains within the bounds of the allocated `dbuf` buffer.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Heap-based buffer overflow:**  The `copyCompBytes21` function can write data beyond the allocated boundary of the heap buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.\n- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The length of the compressed data is read from the input file, and not properly validated before being passed to the copy function. Specifically, the function `litLength21()` can return a length value from 0x0 to 0xFFFFFFFF which is then used in the `copyCompBytes21()` function without verifying that enough memory was allocated for the copy.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Code Execution:** A successful exploit could potentially allow an attacker to overwrite critical data on the heap, leading to arbitrary code execution.\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflow can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Malicious File:** An attacker can craft a malicious .dwg file containing specially crafted compressed data that will trigger the overflow during the decompression process.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **User Interaction:**  The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious .dwg file with a vulnerable version of LibreCAD or any other software using a vulnerable version of libdxfrw.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n1.  The `dwgReader21::readFileHeader` function reads the DWG file header from an offset of `0x80` bytes.\n2.  It decodes part of the header, and then reads two 32-bit values which represent the compressed length of header data, which is stored in `fileHdrCompLength`.\n3.  The function then allocates a buffer `fileHdrData` of a static size of `0x110` bytes.\n4.  If `fileHdrCompLength` is positive, the `dwgCompressor::decompress21` function is called, passing the `fileHdrData` buffer.\n5.  Within the `decompress21` function, the `litLength21()` function is called which determines the length of data to be copied based on the provided input.\n6.  The `copyCompBytes21()` function then takes the calculated length, the source data, and the `fileHdrData` buffer, and copies data without checking if the destination index remains within the allocated size of `0x110` bytes, causing the heap-based buffer overflow.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The vulnerability specifically affects the processing of .dwg files using the AC1021 format.\n* The provided crash information shows the overflow happening within the `dwgCompressor::copyCompBytes21` function, confirming the vulnerability.\n* Patches were released to address this vulnerability, as indicated by the Fedora and Debian security advisories.\n\nThis vulnerability is considered a serious issue due to its potential for arbitrary code execution. Users of vulnerable versions of LibreCAD and libdxfrw should apply the available patches immediately.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | Class | Discouraged | alternate_terms | 0.800 |\n| 2 | 190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | Base | Allowed | alternate_terms | 0.800 |\n| 3 | 122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.316 |\n| 4 | 129 | Improper Validation of Array Index | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.294 |\n| 5 | 193 | Off-by-one Error | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.288 |\n| 6 | 409 | Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification) | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.571 |\n| 7 | 128 | Wrap-around Error | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 131 | Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.286 |\n| 9 | 125 | Out-of-bounds Read | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.281 |\n| 10 | 1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.275 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nBuffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean \"write past the end of a buffer,\" whereas others use the same term to mean \"any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer.\" Others could mean \"any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write.\" Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.\nbuffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term \"buffer overrun,\" but most people use \"buffer overflow.\" See the alternate term for \"buffer overflow\" for context.\nmemory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the \"memory safety\" term.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-118\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nIt is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOverflow: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nWraparound: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nwrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of \"wraparound\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with \"overflow,\" \"underflow,\" and \"wraparound\" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called \"underflows\").\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\n\"Integer overflow\" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.\n\n\nA \"wraparound\" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.\n\n\n\"Overflow\" is sometimes conflated with \"wraparound\" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.\n\n\nThe \"overflow\" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use \"overflow\" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using \"underflow\" for exceeding the minimum.\n\n\nSome people use \"overflow\" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses \"underflow\" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.\n\n\nSee [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.\n\n\n**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-788\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Some examples include:\n\n\n  - simple math errors,\n\n  - incorrectly updating parallel counters,\n\n  - not accounting for size differences when \"transforming\" one input to another format (e.g. URL canonicalization or other transformation that can generate a result that's larger than the original input, i.e. \"expansion\").\n\nThis level of detail is rarely available in public reports, so it is difficult to find good examples.\n\n**[Maintenance]** \n\nThis weakness may be a composite or a chain. It also may contain layering or perspective differences.\n\n\nThis issue may be associated with many different types of incorrect calculations (CWE-682), although the integer overflow (CWE-190) is probably the most prevalent. This can be primary to resource consumption problems (CWE-400), including uncontrolled memory allocation (CWE-789). However, its relationship with out-of-bounds buffer access (CWE-119) must also be considered.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-17087:** Chain: integer truncation (CWE-197) causes small buffer allocation (CWE-131) leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in kernel pool, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2004-1363:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using environment variables that are expanded after the length check is performed\n- **CVE-2004-0747:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using expansion of environment variables\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOOB read: Shorthand for \"Out of bounds\" read\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted .dwg file.\n\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking within the `copyCompBytes21` function. Specifically, the function copies data from a compressed buffer (`cbuf`) to a destination buffer (`dbuf`) without verifying if the destination index (`dix`) remains within the bounds of the allocated `dbuf` buffer.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Heap-based buffer overflow:**  The `copyCompBytes21` function can write data beyond the allocated boundary of the heap buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.\n- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The length of the compressed data is read from the input file, and not properly validated before being passed to the copy function. Specifically, the function `litLength21()` can return a length value from 0x0 to 0xFFFFFFFF which is then used in the `copyCompBytes21()` function without verifying that enough memory was allocated for the copy.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Code Execution:** A successful exploit could potentially allow an attacker to overwrite critical data on the heap, leading to arbitrary code execution.\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflow can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Malicious File:** An attacker can craft a malicious .dwg file containing specially crafted compressed data that will trigger the overflow during the decompression process.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **User Interaction:**  The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious .dwg file with a vulnerable version of LibreCAD or any other software using a vulnerable version of libdxfrw.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n1.  The `dwgReader21::readFileHeader` function reads the DWG file header from an offset of `0x80` bytes.\n2.  It decodes part of the header, and then reads two 32-bit values which represent the compressed length of header data, which is stored in `fileHdrCompLength`.\n3.  The function then allocates a buffer `fileHdrData` of a static size of `0x110` bytes.\n4.  If `fileHdrCompLength` is positive, the `dwgCompressor::decompress21` function is called, passing the `fileHdrData` buffer.\n5.  Within the `decompress21` function, the `litLength21()` function is called which determines the length of data to be copied based on the provided input.\n6.  The `copyCompBytes21()` function then takes the calculated length, the source data, and the `fileHdrData` buffer, and copies data without checking if the destination index remains within the allocated size of `0x110` bytes, causing the heap-based buffer overflow.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The vulnerability specifically affects the processing of .dwg files using the AC1021 format.\n* The provided crash information shows the overflow happening within the `dwgCompressor::copyCompBytes21` function, confirming the vulnerability.\n* Patches were released to address this vulnerability, as indicated by the Fedora and Debian security advisories.\n\nThis vulnerability is considered a serious issue due to its potential for arbitrary code execution. Users of vulnerable versions of LibreCAD and libdxfrw should apply the available patches immediately.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | Class | Discouraged | alternate_terms | 0.800 |\n| 2 | 190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | Base | Allowed | alternate_terms | 0.800 |\n| 3 | 122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.316 |\n| 4 | 129 | Improper Validation of Array Index | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.294 |\n| 5 | 193 | Off-by-one Error | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.288 |\n| 6 | 409 | Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification) | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.571 |\n| 7 | 128 | Wrap-around Error | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 131 | Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.286 |\n| 9 | 125 | Out-of-bounds Read | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.281 |\n| 10 | 1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.275 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.

Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called \"underflows\").\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\n\"Integer overflow\" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.\n\n\nA \"wraparound\" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.\n\n\n\"Overflow\" is sometimes conflated with \"wraparound\" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.\n\n\nThe \"overflow\" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use \"overflow\" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using \"underflow\" for exceeding the minimum.\n\n\nSome people use \"overflow\" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses \"underflow\" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.\n\n\nSee [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.\n\n\n**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190).

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nA code execution vulnerability exists in the dwgCompressorcopyCompBytes21 functionality of LibreCad libdxfrw 2.2.0-rc2-19-ge02f3580. A specially-crafted .dwg file can lead to a **heap buffer overflow**. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **weakness:** **heap buffer overflow**\n- **impact:** code execution\n- **vector:** specially-crafted .dwg file\n- **product:** LibreCad libdxfrw\n- **version:** 2.2.0-rc2-19-ge02f3580\n- **component:** dwgCompressorcopyCompBytes21 functionality\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21899\n\n**Description:** A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `dwgCompressor::copyCompBytes21` function of LibreCad's libdxfrw library. This vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted .dwg file.\n\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking within the `copyCompBytes21` function. Specifically, the function copies data from a compressed buffer (`cbuf`) to a destination buffer (`dbuf`) without verifying if the destination index (`dix`) remains within the bounds of the allocated `dbuf` buffer.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Heap-based buffer overflow:**  The `copyCompBytes21` function can write data beyond the allocated boundary of the heap buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.\n- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The length of the compressed data is read from the input file, and not properly validated before being passed to the copy function. Specifically, the function `litLength21()` can return a length value from 0x0 to 0xFFFFFFFF which is then used in the `copyCompBytes21()` function without verifying that enough memory was allocated for the copy.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Code Execution:** A successful exploit could potentially allow an attacker to overwrite critical data on the heap, leading to arbitrary code execution.\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflow can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Malicious File:** An attacker can craft a malicious .dwg file containing specially crafted compressed data that will trigger the overflow during the decompression process.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **User Interaction:**  The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious .dwg file with a vulnerable version of LibreCAD or any other software using a vulnerable version of libdxfrw.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n1.  The `dwgReader21::readFileHeader` function reads the DWG file header from an offset of `0x80` bytes.\n2.  It decodes part of the header, and then reads two 32-bit values which represent the compressed length of header data, which is stored in `fileHdrCompLength`.\n3.  The function then allocates a buffer `fileHdrData` of a static size of `0x110` bytes.\n4.  If `fileHdrCompLength` is positive, the `dwgCompressor::decompress21` function is called, passing the `fileHdrData` buffer.\n5.  Within the `decompress21` function, the `litLength21()` function is called which determines the length of data to be copied based on the provided input.\n6.  The `copyCompBytes21()` function then takes the calculated length, the source data, and the `fileHdrData` buffer, and copies data without checking if the destination index remains within the allocated size of `0x110` bytes, causing the heap-based buffer overflow.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The vulnerability specifically affects the processing of .dwg files using the AC1021 format.\n* The provided crash information shows the overflow happening within the `dwgCompressor::copyCompBytes21` function, confirming the vulnerability.\n* Patches were released to address this vulnerability, as indicated by the Fedora and Debian security advisories.\n\nThis vulnerability is considered a serious issue due to its potential for arbitrary code execution. Users of vulnerable versions of LibreCAD and libdxfrw should apply the available patches immediately.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | Class | Discouraged | alternate_terms | 0.800 |\n| 2 | 190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | Base | Allowed | alternate_terms | 0.800 |\n| 3 | 122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.316 |\n| 4 | 129 | Improper Validation of Array Index | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.294 |\n| 5 | 193 | Off-by-one Error | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.288 |\n| 6 | 409 | Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification) | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.571 |\n| 7 | 128 | Wrap-around Error | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 131 | Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.286 |\n| 9 | 125 | Out-of-bounds Read | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.281 |\n| 10 | 1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.275 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.

When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOverflow: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nWraparound: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nwrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of \"wraparound\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with \"overflow,\" \"underflow,\" and \"wraparound\" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called \"underflows\").\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\n\"Integer overflow\" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.\n\n\nA \"wraparound\" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.\n\n\n\"Overflow\" is sometimes conflated with \"wraparound\" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.\n\n\nThe \"overflow\" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use \"overflow\" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using \"underflow\" for exceeding the minimum.\n\n\nSome people use \"overflow\" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses \"underflow\" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.\n\n\nSee [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.\n\n\n**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-788\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** \n\nThis is a broad category. Some examples include:\n\n\n  - simple math errors,\n\n  - incorrectly updating parallel counters,\n\n  - not accounting for size differences when \"transforming\" one input to another format (e.g. URL canonicalization or other transformation that can generate a result that's larger than the original input, i.e. \"expansion\").\n\nThis level of detail is rarely available in public reports, so it is difficult to find good examples.\n\n**[Maintenance]** \n\nThis weakness may be a composite or a chain. It also may contain layering or perspective differences.\n\n\nThis issue may be associated with many different types of incorrect calculations (CWE-682), although the integer overflow (CWE-190) is probably the most prevalent. This can be primary to resource consumption problems (CWE-400), including uncontrolled memory allocation (CWE-789). However, its relationship with out-of-bounds buffer access (CWE-119) must also be considered.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-17087:** Chain: integer truncation (CWE-197) causes small buffer allocation (CWE-131) leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in kernel pool, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2004-1363:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using environment variables that are expanded after the length check is performed\n- **CVE-2004-0747:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using expansion of environment variables\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOOB read: Shorthand for \"Out of bounds\" read\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-789\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
