Specifically, there is a lack of authorization checks on HTTP endpoints related to configuration file access.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\nAn attacker with `Overall/Read` permissions can enumerate configuration file IDs. This information could be used to gain further insights into the system configurations and potentially be leveraged for more severe attacks.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\nThe vulnerability is triggered via HTTP requests to specific endpoints within the Config File Provider Plugin.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\nThe attacker requires `Overall/Read` permission in the Jenkins environment to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Summary:**\nCVE-2021-21645 describes a vulnerability in the Config File Provider Plugin where insufficient permission checks allow users with `Overall/Read` permissions to list configuration file IDs. This information could be used as part of a larger attack. The vulnerability is addressed in version 3.7.1 of the plugin, where proper permissions are enforced for such operations.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 862 | Missing Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.314 |\n| 2 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.236 |\n| 3 | 285 | Improper Authorization | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.198 |\n| 4 | 256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.194 |\n| 5 | 522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.184 |\n| 6 | 9 | J2EE Misconfiguration: Weak Access Permissions for EJB Methods | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.521 |\n| 7 | 260 | Password in Configuration File | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 602 | Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.179 |\n| 9 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.176 |\n| 10 | 732 | Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.169 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community.

This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which \"permissions\" are not checked, which is an \"authorization\" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions for files under the \"Program Files\" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.\n- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.\n\n Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-306 CWE-862 CWE-285 CWE-274 CWE-668 CWE-863 CWE-266 CWE-276 CWE-280 CWE-639",

Specifically, there is a lack of authorization checks on HTTP endpoints related to configuration file access.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\nAn attacker with `Overall/Read` permissions can enumerate configuration file IDs. This information could be used to gain further insights into the system configurations and potentially be leveraged for more severe attacks.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\nThe vulnerability is triggered via HTTP requests to specific endpoints within the Config File Provider Plugin.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\nThe attacker requires `Overall/Read` permission in the Jenkins environment to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Summary:**\nCVE-2021-21645 describes a vulnerability in the Config File Provider Plugin where insufficient permission checks allow users with `Overall/Read` permissions to list configuration file IDs. This information could be used as part of a larger attack. The vulnerability is addressed in version 3.7.1 of the plugin, where proper permissions are enforced for such operations.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 862 | Missing Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.314 |\n| 2 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.236 |\n| 3 | 285 | Improper Authorization | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.198 |\n| 4 | 256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.194 |\n| 5 | 522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.184 |\n| 6 | 9 | J2EE Misconfiguration: Weak Access Permissions for EJB Methods | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.521 |\n| 7 | 260 | Password in Configuration File | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 602 | Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.179 |\n| 9 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.176 |\n| 10 | 732 | Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.169 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community.
