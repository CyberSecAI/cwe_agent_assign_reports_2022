By using Developer tools or similar, it is possible to change the obfuscation so that the credentials are visible.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **weakness:** **hide SSH secrets, Windows passwords, and SNMP strings**\n- **impact:** view the credentials\n- **vector:** Developer tools or similar\n- **product:** Open-AudIT\n- **version:** up to version 3.5.3\n- **component:** web interface\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3130:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe web interface of Open-AudIT uses HTML password fields to \"obfuscate\" sensitive credentials like SSH secrets, Windows passwords, and SNMP strings. This method relies on client-side obfuscation rather than proper server-side protection.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n-   **Insufficient Credential Protection:** The primary vulnerability is the inadequate protection of sensitive credentials. Hiding these credentials using HTML password fields is a weak form of obfuscation.\n-   **Client-Side Security Flaw:** The vulnerability exists because the security relies on client-side mechanisms that can be easily bypassed using browser developer tools.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n-   **Credential Exposure:** An attacker can easily reveal stored credentials (SSH secrets, Windows passwords, and SNMP strings) by inspecting the HTML source or using browser developer tools.\n-   **Potential Unauthorized Access:** The exposed credentials could then be used for unauthorized access to systems or resources, potentially leading to further compromise.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n-   **Remote Access:** The attack is remote as it exploits a web interface vulnerability.\n-   **Browser Manipulation:** Attackers leverage web browser developer tools to bypass the client-side obfuscation.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n-   **Access to Open-AudIT Web Interface:** The attacker must have access to the web interface of the vulnerable Open-AudIT instance.\n-   **Basic Web Development/Browser Skills:** The attacker must be able to use browser developer tools or inspect HTML source code to reveal the credentials.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability exists in Open-AudIT up to version 4.0.2\n- The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor\n- The affected product is Open-AudIT by Opmantek.\n\nThis vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass client-side security and access sensitive credentials stored within the application, which could result in significant security breaches if not addressed.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 656 | Reliance on Security Through Obscurity | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.483 |\n| 2 | 532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.272 |\n| 3 | 256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.258 |\n| 4 | 1392 | Use of Default Credentials | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.258 |\n| 5 | 798 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.243 |\n| 6 | 317 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in GUI | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.501 |\n| 7 | 321 | Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key | Variant | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.241 |\n| 9 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.236 |\n| 10 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.236 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-656: Reliance on Security Through Obscurity\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a protection mechanism whose strength depends heavily on its obscurity, such that knowledge of its algorithms or key data is sufficient to defeat the mechanism.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis reliance on \"security through obscurity\" can produce resultant weaknesses if an attacker is able to reverse engineer the inner workings of the mechanism. Note that obscurity can be one small part of defense in depth, since it can create more work for an attacker; however, it is a significant risk if used as the primary means of protection.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNever Assuming your secrets are safe\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-657\nChildOf -> CWE-693\nCanPrecede -> CWE-259\nCanPrecede -> CWE-321\nCanPrecede -> CWE-472\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Note that there is a close relationship between this weakness and CWE-603 (Use of Client-Side Authentication). If developers do not believe that a user can reverse engineer a client, then they are more likely to choose client-side authentication in the belief that it is safe.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2006-6588:** Reliance on hidden form fields in a web application. Many web application vulnerabilities exist because the developer did not consider that \"hidden\" form fields can be processed using a modified client.\n- **CVE-2006-7142:** Hard-coded cryptographic key stored in executable program.\n- **CVE-2005-4002:** Hard-coded cryptographic key stored in executable program.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product writes sensitive information to a log file.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-538\nChildOf -> CWE-200\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise. However, if admins do not change the defaults, it is easier for attackers to bypass authentication quickly across multiple organizations.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1391\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.\n\n  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1391\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-344\nChildOf -> CWE-671\nPeerOf -> CWE-257\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29953:** Condition Monitor firmware has a maintenance interface with hard-coded credentials\n- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation\n- **CVE-2022-29964:** Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-317: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in GUI\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within the GUI.\n\n### Extended Description\nAn attacker can often obtain data from a GUI, even if hidden, by using an API to directly access GUI objects such as windows and menus. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-312\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** Different people use \"cleartext\" and \"plaintext\" to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-1848:** Unencrypted passwords stored in GUI dialog may allow local users to access the passwords.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions.

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nWithin the Open-AudIT up to version 3.5.3 application, the web interface hides SSH secrets, Windows passwords, and SNMP strings from users using HTML password field obfuscation. By using Developer tools or similar, it is possible to change the obfuscation so that the credentials are visible.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **weakness:** **hide SSH secrets, Windows passwords, and SNMP strings**\n- **impact:** view the credentials\n- **vector:** Developer tools or similar\n- **product:** Open-AudIT\n- **version:** up to version 3.5.3\n- **component:** web interface\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3130:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe web interface of Open-AudIT uses HTML password fields to \"obfuscate\" sensitive credentials like SSH secrets, Windows passwords, and SNMP strings. This method relies on client-side obfuscation rather than proper server-side protection.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n-   **Insufficient Credential Protection:** The primary vulnerability is the inadequate protection of sensitive credentials. Hiding these credentials using HTML password fields is a weak form of obfuscation.\n-   **Client-Side Security Flaw:** The vulnerability exists because the security relies on client-side mechanisms that can be easily bypassed using browser developer tools.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n-   **Credential Exposure:** An attacker can easily reveal stored credentials (SSH secrets, Windows passwords, and SNMP strings) by inspecting the HTML source or using browser developer tools.\n-   **Potential Unauthorized Access:** The exposed credentials could then be used for unauthorized access to systems or resources, potentially leading to further compromise.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n-   **Remote Access:** The attack is remote as it exploits a web interface vulnerability.\n-   **Browser Manipulation:** Attackers leverage web browser developer tools to bypass the client-side obfuscation.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n-   **Access to Open-AudIT Web Interface:** The attacker must have access to the web interface of the vulnerable Open-AudIT instance.\n-   **Basic Web Development/Browser Skills:** The attacker must be able to use browser developer tools or inspect HTML source code to reveal the credentials.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability exists in Open-AudIT up to version 4.0.2\n- The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor\n- The affected product is Open-AudIT by Opmantek.\n\nThis vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass client-side security and access sensitive credentials stored within the application, which could result in significant security breaches if not addressed.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 656 | Reliance on Security Through Obscurity | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.483 |\n| 2 | 532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.272 |\n| 3 | 256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.258 |\n| 4 | 1392 | Use of Default Credentials | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.258 |\n| 5 | 798 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.243 |\n| 6 | 317 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in GUI | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.501 |\n| 7 | 321 | Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key | Variant | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.241 |\n| 9 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.236 |\n| 10 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.236 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-656: Reliance on Security Through Obscurity\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a protection mechanism whose strength depends heavily on its obscurity, such that knowledge of its algorithms or key data is sufficient to defeat the mechanism.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis reliance on \"security through obscurity\" can produce resultant weaknesses if an attacker is able to reverse engineer the inner workings of the mechanism. Note that obscurity can be one small part of defense in depth, since it can create more work for an attacker; however, it is a significant risk if used as the primary means of protection.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNever Assuming your secrets are safe\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-657\nChildOf -> CWE-693\nCanPrecede -> CWE-259\nCanPrecede -> CWE-321\nCanPrecede -> CWE-472\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Note that there is a close relationship between this weakness and CWE-603 (Use of Client-Side Authentication). If developers do not believe that a user can reverse engineer a client, then they are more likely to choose client-side authentication in the belief that it is safe.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2006-6588:** Reliance on hidden form fields in a web application. Many web application vulnerabilities exist because the developer did not consider that \"hidden\" form fields can be processed using a modified client.\n- **CVE-2006-7142:** Hard-coded cryptographic key stored in executable program.\n- **CVE-2005-4002:** Hard-coded cryptographic key stored in executable program.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product writes sensitive information to a log file.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-538\nChildOf -> CWE-200\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-522\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise. However, if admins do not change the defaults, it is easier for attackers to bypass authentication quickly across multiple organizations.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1391\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.\n\n  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1391\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-344\nChildOf -> CWE-671\nPeerOf -> CWE-257\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
