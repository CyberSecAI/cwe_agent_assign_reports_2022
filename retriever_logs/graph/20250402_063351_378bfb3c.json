The original implementation likely had a flaw in how it set or validated authentication cookies when accessing the documentation, which was a potential security risk.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\nThe specific weakness isn't explicitly detailed, but it is inferred as a security issue.  It is related to the authentication cookie mechanism within the documentation plugin. The commit message mentions \"change documentation auth cookie system,\" suggesting a flawed system existed previously, which is now modified. The vulnerability is categorized as a \"security\" issue and is located within the \"plugin:documentation\".\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\nThe provided text doesn't explicitly describe the impact, but since it's a security issue related to authentication, potential impacts could include:\n\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the documentation if the cookie mechanism was weak.\n*   **Information Disclosure:** Depending on the vulnerability details, sensitive information might be exposed through the documentation if authentication was bypassed.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\nThe attack vector would involve exploiting the flawed cookie mechanism. The documentation does not go into further detail.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\nThe attacker would need to identify and exploit the vulnerability in the cookie handling of the documentation plugin, implying:\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker would need network access to the Strapi instance and the ability to interact with the documentation routes.\n*   **Technical Knowledge:** Understanding of web application vulnerabilities, cookie handling, and the Strapi framework would be required.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n*   The pull request was merged into the `releases/v3.6.9` branch, indicating this was a fix for the Strapi v3.6.9 version.\n*   The change is related to the authentication system for the documentation plugin, suggesting the issue is related to how authentication is handled.\n*   The commit introduced changes in `packages/strapi-plugin-documentation/config/policies/index.js`. This file likely contains the configuration for authentication policies related to the documentation plugin.\n\nIt should be noted that the provided text is from a GitHub pull request and related websites and therefore does not explicitly provide detailed vulnerability information.

However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.\n- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie\n- **CVE-2009-1466:** password stored in cleartext in a file with insecure permissions\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30018:** A messaging platform serializes all elements of User/Group objects, making private information available to adversaries\n- **CVE-2022-29959:** Initialization file contains credentials that can be decoded using a \"simple string transformation\"\n- **CVE-2022-35411:** Python-based RPC framework enables pickle functionality by default, allowing clients to unpickle untrusted data.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany communication channels can be \"sniffed\" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.\n\n\nApplicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.\n\n\nWhen full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to \"sniff\" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-311\nChildOf -> CWE-311\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29519:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends sensitive information in plaintext, including passwords and session tokens.\n- **CVE-2022-30312:** Building Controller uses a protocol that transmits authentication credentials in plaintext.\n- **CVE-2022-31204:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends password in plaintext.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product stores sensitive information without properly limiting read or write access by unauthorized actors.\n\n### Extended Description\nIf read access is not properly restricted, then attackers can steal the sensitive information. If write access is not properly restricted, then attackers can modify and possibly delete the data, causing incorrect results and possibly a denial of service.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** There is an overlapping relationship between insecure storage of sensitive information (CWE-922) and missing encryption of sensitive information (CWE-311). Encryption is often used to prevent an attacker from reading the sensitive data. However, encryption does not prevent the attacker from erasing or overwriting the data. While data tampering would be visible upon inspection, the integrity and availability of the data is compromised prior to the audit.\n\n**[Maintenance]** This is a high-level entry that includes children from various parts of the CWE research view (CWE-1000). Currently, most of the information is in these child entries. This entry will be made more comprehensive in later CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-523: Unprotected Transport of Credentials\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nLogin pages do not use adequate measures to protect the user name and password while they are in transit from the client to the server.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-522\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-312\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10.

For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.\n\n\nApplicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.\n\n\nWhen full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to \"sniff\" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-311\nChildOf -> CWE-311\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\n**Storing passwords in a recoverable format** in the DOCUMENTATION plugin component of Strapi before 3.6.9 and 4.x before 4.1.5 allows an attacker to access a victims HTTP request, get the victims cookie, perform a base64 decode on the victims cookie, and obtain a cleartext password, leading to getting API documentation for further API attacks.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **Storing passwords in a recoverable format**\n- **impact:** access API documentation\n- **attacker:** attacker\n- **product:** Strapi\n- **version:** before 3.6.9 and 4.x before 4.1.5\n- **component:** DOCUMENTATION plugin component\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed in the mentioned pull request:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the way the documentation plugin in Strapi handled authentication cookies. The original implementation likely had a flaw in how it set or validated authentication cookies when accessing the documentation, which was a potential security risk.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\nThe specific weakness isn't explicitly detailed, but it is inferred as a security issue.  It is related to the authentication cookie mechanism within the documentation plugin. The commit message mentions \"change documentation auth cookie system,\" suggesting a flawed system existed previously, which is now modified. The vulnerability is categorized as a \"security\" issue and is located within the \"plugin:documentation\".\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\nThe provided text doesn't explicitly describe the impact, but since it's a security issue related to authentication, potential impacts could include:\n\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the documentation if the cookie mechanism was weak.\n*   **Information Disclosure:** Depending on the vulnerability details, sensitive information might be exposed through the documentation if authentication was bypassed.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\nThe attack vector would involve exploiting the flawed cookie mechanism. The documentation does not go into further detail.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\nThe attacker would need to identify and exploit the vulnerability in the cookie handling of the documentation plugin, implying:\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker would need network access to the Strapi instance and the ability to interact with the documentation routes.\n*   **Technical Knowledge:** Understanding of web application vulnerabilities, cookie handling, and the Strapi framework would be required.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n*   The pull request was merged into the `releases/v3.6.9` branch, indicating this was a fix for the Strapi v3.6.9 version.\n*   The change is related to the authentication system for the documentation plugin, suggesting the issue is related to how authentication is handled.\n*   The commit introduced changes in `packages/strapi-plugin-documentation/config/policies/index.js`. This file likely contains the configuration for authentication policies related to the documentation plugin.\n\nIt should be noted that the provided text is from a GitHub pull request and related websites and therefore does not explicitly provide detailed vulnerability information. It is also missing the CVE description.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 257 | Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.654 |\n| 2 | 256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.407 |\n| 3 | 312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.401 |\n| 4 | 522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.385 |\n| 5 | 319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.367 |\n| 6 | 922 | Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information | Class | Allowed-with-Review | dense | 0.507 |\n| 7 | 523 | Unprotected Transport of Credentials | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 321 | Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.360 |\n| 9 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.360 |\n| 10 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.358 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users. In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders. If a system administrator can recover a password directly, or use a brute force search on the available information, the administrator can use the password on other accounts.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-522\nPeerOf -> CWE-259\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation\n- **CVE-2022-30271:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used by default.\n- **CVE-2020-10884:** WiFi router service has a hard-coded encryption key, allowing root access\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAttackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less effort than expected.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)\n- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.\n- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.\n\n Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-303 CWE-312 CWE-257 CWE-319 CWE-1390 CWE-1391 CWE-321",
