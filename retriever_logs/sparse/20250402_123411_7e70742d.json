This leaks a small amount of random information from the firewall memory into the Ethernet packets. An attacker on the same Ethernet subnet as the PAN-OS firewall is able to collect potentially sensitive information from these packets. This issue is also known as Etherleak and is detected by security scanners as CVE-2003-0001. This issue impacts PAN-OS 8.1 version earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.18 PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.12 PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.5.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **Padding bytes in Ethernet packets ... are not cleared**\n- **impact:** leak a small amount of random information\n- **attacker:** attacker on the same Ethernet subnet\n- **product:** PA-200, PA-220, PA-500, PA-800, PA-2000 Series, PA-3000 Series, PA-3200 Series, PA-5200 Series, and PA-7000 Series firewalls\n- **version:** PAN-OS 8.1 earlier than 8.1.18, 9.0 earlier than 9.0.12, 9.1 earlier than 9.1.5\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\n- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Padding bytes in Ethernet packets are not cleared before the data frame is created, leading to the leakage of random information from firewall memory.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information exposure due to the inclusion of uninitialized memory content in Ethernet packets.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker on the same Ethernet subnet can collect potentially sensitive information from the leaked memory contents in the Ethernet packets.\n- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be on the same Ethernet subnet as the vulnerable PAN-OS firewall.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be on the same local network segment as the targeted firewall.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 212 | Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer | Base | Allowed | sparse | 1.524 |\n| 2 | 406 | Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume (Network Amplification) | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.928 |\n| 3 | 347 | Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.853 |\n| 4 | 532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.786 |\n| 5 | 367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.772 |\n| 6 | 401 | Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.548 |\n| 7 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 916 | Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.767 |\n| 9 | 287 | Improper Authentication | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.676 |\n| 10 | 400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.656 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nResources that may contain sensitive data include documents, packets, messages, databases, etc. While this data may be useful to an individual user or small set of users who share the resource, it may need to be removed before the resource can be shared outside of the trusted group. The process of removal is sometimes called cleansing or scrubbing.\n\n\nFor example, a product for editing documents might not remove sensitive data such as reviewer comments or the local pathname where the document is stored. Or, a proxy might not remove an internal IP address from headers before making an outgoing request to an Internet site.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-669\nChildOf -> CWE-669\nCanPrecede -> CWE-201\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This entry is intended to be different from resultant information leaks, including those that occur from improper buffer initialization and reuse, improper encryption, interaction errors, and multiple interpretation errors. This entry could be regarded as a privacy leak, depending on the type of information that is leaked.\n\n**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).\n\n**[Terminology]** The terms \"cleansing\" and \"scrubbing\" have multiple uses within computing. In information security, these are used for the removal of sensitive data, but they are also used for the modification of incoming/outgoing data so that it conforms to specifications.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release\n- **CVE-2005-0406:** Some image editors modify a JPEG image, but the original EXIF thumbnail image is left intact within the JPEG. (Also an interaction error).\n- **CVE-2002-0704:** NAT feature in firewall leaks internal IP addresses in ICMP error messages.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-406: Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume (Network Amplification)\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not sufficiently monitor or control transmitted network traffic volume, so that an actor can cause the product to transmit more traffic than should be allowed for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nIn the absence of a policy to restrict asymmetric resource consumption, the application or system cannot distinguish between legitimate transmissions and traffic intended to serve as an amplifying attack on target systems. Systems can often be configured to restrict the amount of traffic sent out on behalf of a client, based on the client's origin or access level. This is usually defined in a resource allocation policy. In the absence of a mechanism to keep track of transmissions, the system or application can be easily abused to transmit asymmetrically greater traffic than the request or client should be permitted to.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-405\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from weaknesses that simplify spoofing attacks.\n\n**[Theoretical]** Network amplification, when performed with spoofing, is normally a multi-channel attack from attacker (acting as user) to amplifier, and amplifier to victim.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-0513:** Classic \"Smurf\" attack, using spoofed ICMP packets to broadcast addresses.\n- **CVE-1999-1379:** DNS query with spoofed source address causes more traffic to be returned to spoofed address than was sent by the attacker.\n- **CVE-2000-0041:** Large datagrams are sent in response to malformed datagrams.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-345\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-1796:** Does not properly verify signatures for \"trusted\" entities.\n- **CVE-2005-2181:** Insufficient verification allows spoofing.\n- **CVE-2005-2182:** Insufficient verification allows spoofing.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product writes sensitive information to a log file.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-538\nChildOf -> CWE-200\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nTOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to \"Time Of Check To Time Of Use\".\nTOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nChildOf -> CWE-362\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.\n- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis is often triggered by improper handling of malformed data or unexpectedly interrupted sessions. In some languages, developers are responsible for tracking memory allocation and releasing the memory. If there are no more pointers or references to the memory, then it can no longer be tracked and identified for release.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nMemory Leak\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-772\nChildOf -> CWE-404\nChildOf -> CWE-404\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is often a resultant weakness due to improper handling of malformed data or early termination of sessions.\n\n**[Terminology]** \"memory leak\" has sometimes been used to describe other kinds of issues, e.g. for information leaks in which the contents of memory are inadvertently leaked (CVE-2003-0400 is one such example of this terminology conflict).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-3119:** Memory leak because function does not free() an element of a data structure.\n- **CVE-2004-0427:** Memory leak when counter variable is not decremented.\n- **CVE-2002-0574:** chain: reference count is not decremented, leading to memory leak in OS by sending ICMP packets.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-209\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-202\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany password storage mechanisms compute a hash and store the hash, instead of storing the original password in plaintext. In this design, authentication involves accepting an incoming password, computing its hash, and comparing it to the stored hash.\n\n\nMany hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. However, this efficiency is a problem for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker's workload for brute-force password cracking. If an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method (such as SQL injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by computing hashes efficiently. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing (such as cloud computing) and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware. In such a scenario, an efficient hash algorithm helps the attacker.\n\n\nThere are several properties of a hash scheme that are relevant to its strength against an offline, massively-parallel attack:\n\n\n  - The amount of CPU time required to compute the hash (\"stretching\")\n\n  - The amount of memory required to compute the hash (\"memory-hard\" operations)\n\n  - Including a random value, along with the password, as input to the hash computation (\"salting\")\n\n  - Given a hash, there is no known way of determining an input (e.g., a password) that produces this hash value, other than by guessing possible inputs (\"one-way\" hashing)\n\n  - Relative to the number of all possible hashes that can be generated by the scheme, there is a low likelihood of producing the same hash for multiple different inputs (\"collision resistance\")\n\nNote that the security requirements for the product may vary depending on the environment and the value of the passwords. Different schemes might not provide all of these properties, yet may still provide sufficient security for the environment. Conversely, a solution might be very strong in preserving one property, which still being very weak for an attack against another property, or it might not be able to significantly reduce the efficiency of a massively-parallel attack.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-328\nChildOf -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2008-1526:** Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.\n- **CVE-2006-1058:** Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.\n- **CVE-2008-4905:** Blogging software uses a hard-coded salt when calculating a password hash.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nWhen an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nauthentification: An alternate term is \"authentification\", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.\nAuthN: \"AuthN\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authentication\" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from \"AuthZ,\" which is an abbreviation of \"authorization.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\nAuthC: \"AuthC\" is used as an abbreviation of \"authentication,\" but it appears to used less frequently than \"AuthN.\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nLimited resources include memory, file system storage, database connection pool entries, and CPU. If an attacker can trigger the allocation of these limited resources, but the number or size of the resources is not controlled, then the attacker could cause a denial of service that consumes all available resources. This would prevent valid users from accessing the product, and it could potentially have an impact on the surrounding environment. For example, a memory exhaustion attack against an application could slow down the application as well as its host operating system.\n\n\nThere are at least three distinct scenarios which can commonly lead to resource exhaustion:\n\n\n  - Lack of throttling for the number of allocated resources\n\n  - Losing all references to a resource before reaching the shutdown stage\n\n  - Not closing/returning a resource after processing\n\nResource exhaustion problems are often result due to an incorrect implementation of the following situations:\n\n  - Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.\n\n  - Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nResource Exhaustion\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is causing resource consumption, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake. Consider children/descendants such as CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling, CWE-771: Missing Reference to Active Allocated Resource, CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool, CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime, CWE-834: Excessive Iteration, CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification), and others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** \"Resource consumption\" could be interpreted as a consequence instead of an insecure behavior, so this entry is being considered for modification. It appears to be referenced too frequently when more precise mappings are available. Some of its children, such as CWE-771, might be better considered as a chain.\n\n**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. \"Resource exhaustion\" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.\n\n**[Other]** \n\nDatabase queries that take a long time to process are good DoS targets. An attacker would have to write a few lines of Perl code to generate enough traffic to exceed the site's ability to keep up. This would effectively prevent authorized users from using the site at all. Resources can be exploited simply by ensuring that the target machine must do much more work and consume more resources in order to service a request than the attacker must do to initiate a request.\n\n\nA prime example of this can be found in old switches that were vulnerable to \"macof\" attacks (so named for a tool developed by Dugsong). These attacks flooded a switch with random IP and MAC address combinations, therefore exhausting the switch's cache, which held the information of which port corresponded to which MAC addresses. Once this cache was exhausted, the switch would fail in an insecure way and would begin to act simply as a hub, broadcasting all traffic on all ports and allowing for basic sniffing attacks.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2020-7218:** Go-based workload orchestrator does not limit resource usage with unauthenticated connections, allowing a DoS by flooding the service\n- **CVE-2020-3566:** Resource exhaustion in distributed OS because of \"insufficient\" IGMP queue management, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n",
