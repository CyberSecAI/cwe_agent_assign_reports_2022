A specially crafted MPEG-4 input using the ctts FOURCC code can cause an **integer overflow** due to **unchecked arithmetic** resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **unchecked arithmetic**\n- **weakness:** **integer overflow**\n- **impact:** heap-based buffer overflow\n- **vector:** specially crafted MPEG-4 input using the ctts FOURCC code\n- **product:** GPAC Project\n- **version:** Advanced Content library v1.0.1\n- **component:** MPEG-4 decoding functionality\n\n### CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\n### Primary CWE Match\nCWE-119\n\n#### Top CWEs\n- CWE-119 (Count: 33)\n- CWE-190 (Count: 7)\n- CWE-681 (Count: 6)\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21836:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is an integer overflow vulnerability in the `ctts_box_read` function within the GPAC library when processing an atom with the \"ctts\" FOURCC code. This overflow occurs when calculating the size of the memory to allocate for entries.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Integer Overflow:** A 32-bit integer representing the number of entries is multiplied by the size of the `GF_DttsEntry` structure. On 32-bit platforms, this multiplication can result in an integer overflow, leading to a smaller-than-expected memory allocation.\n- **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:** After an undersized buffer is allocated, the code proceeds to read data from the input stream into this buffer. Because the buffer is smaller than required, this leads to a heap-based buffer overflow when the input data is written past the allocated memory.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Memory Corruption:** The heap-based buffer overflow corrupts memory, potentially overwriting adjacent heap structures.\n- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By carefully crafting a malicious MPEG-4 input file, an attacker could potentially overwrite function pointers or other critical data structures on the heap, allowing them to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application using the vulnerable library.\n- **Denial of Service:** Even if arbitrary code execution is not achieved, the memory corruption could lead to application crashes, resulting in denial of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Malicious MPEG-4 File:** The primary attack vector is providing the vulnerable application or library a specially crafted MPEG-4 file.\n- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when the application attempts to parse the crafted file. This can be done through social engineering, where an attacker tricks the victim into opening the malicious video.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **File Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a valid-looking MPEG-4 file with malicious content.\n- **User Interaction/Social Engineering:** The attacker must trick a user into opening the malicious file with a vulnerable application.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\nThe vulnerability lies in the following code snippet:\n\n```c\nsrc/isomedia/box_code_base.c:386\nGF_Err ctts_box_read(GF_Box *s, GF_BitStream *bs)\n{\n    u32 i;\n    u32 sampleCount;\n    GF_CompositionOffsetBox *ptr = (GF_CompositionOffsetBox *)s;\n\n    ISOM_DECREASE_SIZE(ptr, 4);\n    ptr->nb_entries = gf_bs_read_u32(bs);                                               // [20] read u32 from input\n\n    if (ptr->nb_entries > ptr->size / 8) {                                              // [20] check entries againsti nput\n        GF_LOG(GF_LOG_ERROR, GF_LOG_CONTAINER, (\"[iso file] Invalid number of entries %d in ctts\\n\", ptr->nb_entries));\n        return GF_ISOM_INVALID_FILE;\n    }\n\n    ptr->alloc_size = ptr->nb_entries;                                                  // [21] assign number of entries to \"alloc_size\" field\n    ptr->entries = (GF_DttsEntry *)gf_malloc(sizeof(GF_DttsEntry)*ptr->alloc_size);     // [20] calculate size of allocation using \"alloc_size\" field\n    if (!ptr->entries) return GF_OUT_OF_MEM;\n    sampleCount = 0;\n    for (i=0; i<ptr->nb_entries; i++) {\n        ISOM_DECREASE_SIZE(ptr, 8);\n        ptr->entries[i].sampleCount = gf_bs_read_u32(bs);                               // [22] read entries from atom into undersized array\n        if (ptr->version)\n            ptr->entries[i].decodingOffset = gf_bs_read_int(bs, 32);\n        else\n            ptr->entries[i].decodingOffset = (s32) gf_bs_read_u32(bs);\n...\n    }\n...\n    return GF_OK;\n}\n```\nSpecifically:\n\n1.  `ptr->nb_entries` is read as a `u32` value.\n2.  A check `ptr->nb_entries > ptr->size / 8` against a 64-bit size is performed, which is not sufficient for overflow prevention.\n3.  `ptr->alloc_size = ptr->nb_entries;` assigns this value to a separate variable of type `u32`.\n4.  `ptr->entries = (GF_DttsEntry *)gf_malloc(sizeof(GF_DttsEntry)*ptr->alloc_size);` The `alloc_size`, a 32-bit value, is multiplied by `sizeof(GF_DttsEntry)`. On 32 bit systems, this multiplication can result in an integer overflow.\n5.  The loop that follows reads data into the allocated buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds write.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The vulnerability is specific to 32-bit platforms. 64-bit platforms may not be affected by the integer overflow due to the larger address space and register size used in arithmetic operations.\n- The provided proof-of-concept for this vulnerability triggers a crash due to a zero sized allocation\n- The report also notes that other vulnerabilities are present in the same library.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | Base | Allowed | alternate_terms | 0.800 |\n| 2 | 197 | Numeric Truncation Error | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.717 |\n| 3 | 122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.458 |\n| 4 | 125 | Out-of-bounds Read | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.435 |\n| 5 | 193 | Off-by-one Error | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.419 |\n| 6 | 680 | Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow | Compound | Discouraged | dense | 0.569 |\n| 7 | 128 | Wrap-around Error | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.419 |\n| 9 | 787 | Out-of-bounds Write | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.413 |\n| 10 | 119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.412 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOverflow: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nWraparound: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nwrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of \"wraparound\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with \"overflow,\" \"underflow,\" and \"wraparound\" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called \"underflows\").\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\n\"Integer overflow\" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.\n\n\nA \"wraparound\" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.\n\n\n\"Overflow\" is sometimes conflated with \"wraparound\" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.\n\n\nThe \"overflow\" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use \"overflow\" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using \"underflow\" for exceeding the minimum.\n\n\nSome people use \"overflow\" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses \"underflow\" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.\n\n\nSee [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.\n\n\n**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a primitive is cast to a smaller primitive, the high order bits of the large value are lost in the conversion, potentially resulting in an unexpected value that is not equal to the original value. This value may be required as an index into a buffer, a loop iterator, or simply necessary state data. In any case, the value cannot be trusted and the system will be in an undefined state. While this method may be employed viably to isolate the low bits of a value, this usage is rare, and truncation usually implies that an implementation error has occurred.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-681\nChildOf -> CWE-681\nChildOf -> CWE-681\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-195\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-196\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-192\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-194\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean \"write past the end of a buffer,\" whereas others use the same term to mean \"any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer.\" Others could mean \"any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write.\" Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.\nbuffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term \"buffer overrun,\" but most people use \"buffer overflow.\" See the alternate term for \"buffer overflow\" for context.\nmemory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the \"memory safety\" term.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-118\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nIt is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist\n\n",
