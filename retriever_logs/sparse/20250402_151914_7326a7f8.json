CWE-126: Buffer Over-read (Score: 271.16)\n\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer....\n\n### 2. CWE-193: Off-by-one Error (Score: 222.69)\n\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value....\n\n### 3. CWE-170: Improper Null Termination (Score: 207.72)\n\nThe product does not terminate or incorrectly terminates a string or array with a null character or equivalent terminator....\n\n### 4. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Score: 185.07)\n\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....\n\n### 5. CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation (Score: 160.93)\n\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation....\n\n## WEAKNESS: 'is_last_single_ascii in code1.c and rs_encode_uint in reedsol.c'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1. CWE-126: Buffer Over-read (Score: 271.16)\n\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer....\n\n### 2. CWE-193: Off-by-one Error (Score: 222.69)\n\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value....\n\n### 3. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 215.63)\n\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....\n\n### 4. CWE-170: Improper Null Termination (Score: 207.72)\n\nThe product does not terminate or incorrectly terminates a string or array with a null character or equivalent terminator....\n\n### 5. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Score: 185.07)\n\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....\n\n## PRODUCT: 'Zint Barcode Generator'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this PRODUCT:\n\n### 1. CWE-126: Buffer Over-read (Score: 271.16)\n\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer....\n\n### 2. CWE-193: Off-by-one Error (Score: 222.69)\n\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value....\n\n### 3. CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) (Score: 51.92)\n\nThe product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in a security context, but the PRNG's algorithm is not cryptographically strong....\n\n### 4. CWE-335: Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) (Score: 46.35)\n\nThe product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) but does not correctly manage seeds....\n\n### 5. CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 45.82)\n\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function)....\n\n## VERSION: 'before 2.10.0'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this VERSION:\n\n### 1. CWE-126: Buffer Over-read (Score: 271.16)\n\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer....\n\n### 2.
