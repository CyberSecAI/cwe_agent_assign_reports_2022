  "query": "## Vulnerability Description\nXWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Between (and including) versions 13.1RC1 and 13.1, the reset password form reveals the email address of users just by giving their username. The problem has been patched on XWiki 13.2RC1. As a workaround, it is possible to manually modify the `resetpasswordinline.vm` to perform the changes made to mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **impact:** reveal email address of users\n- **vector:** giving username\n- **product:** XWiki Platform\n- **version:** between 13.1RC1 and 13.1\n- **component:** reset password form\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe reset password form in XWiki was displaying the user's email address in plain text, instead of obfuscating it, when a password reset request was initiated. This occurred because the `$email` variable was directly used in the message displayed to the user after requesting the password reset in the `resetpasswordinline.vm` template.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of user email addresses via the reset password form. This constitutes an information leak, a violation of confidentiality.\n*   **Lack of Obfuscation:** The system failed to properly obfuscate or mask the user's email address in the reset password confirmation message.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Privacy Violation:** Attackers could obtain valid email addresses for registered users by initiating password reset requests.\n*   **Targeted Attacks:** The disclosed email addresses could be used in phishing attacks, spam campaigns, or other social engineering attacks.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, as it is exploited through the web interface of the XWiki platform.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **No special access required:** An attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any privileges to exploit the vulnerability.\n*   **Knowledge of Username:** The attacker needs to know a valid username on the XWiki instance to trigger the password reset functionality and obtain the associated email address.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the XWiki application to interact with the reset password form.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Versions:** XWiki versions 13.1RC1 and 13.1 are affected.\n*   **Patched Version:** The issue is fixed in version 13.2RC1.\n*   **Vulnerable Code:** The vulnerability was located in `xwiki-platform-web/src/main/webapp/templates/resetpasswordinline.vm`, where the email was not properly obfuscated.\n*   **Patch:** The fix involves modifying the template to obfuscate the email address using `$services.mail.general.obfuscate($email)`.\n*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-200 (Information Exposure).\n*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 (Moderate), with the following metrics: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.\n\nIn summary, this is an information disclosure vulnerability where the reset password form reveals user email addresses to unauthenticated users by not obfuscating them when sending the password reset confirmation message.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 116 | Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.172 |\n| 2 | 202 | Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.170 |\n| 3 | 552 | Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.164 |\n| 4 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.163 |\n| 5 | 328 | Use of Weak Hash | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.146 |\n| 6 | 620 | Unverified Password Change | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.434 |\n| 7 | 226 | Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.145 |\n| 9 | 1336 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.143 |\n| 10 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.139 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nImproper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.\n\n\nMost products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, \"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\" is a structured message containing a command (\"GET\") with a single argument (\"/index.html\") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (\"HTTP/1.1\").\n\n\nIf an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOutput Sanitization\nOutput Validation\nOutput Encoding\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\nCanPrecede -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness is primary to all weaknesses related to injection (CWE-74) since the inherent nature of injection involves the violation of structured messages.\n\n**[Relationship]** \n\nCWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.\n\n\nHowever, input validation is not always sufficient, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\n**[Terminology]** The usage of the \"encoding\" and \"escaping\" terms varies widely. For example, in some programming languages, the terms are used interchangeably, while other languages provide APIs that use both terms for different tasks. This overlapping usage extends to the Web, such as the \"escape\" JavaScript function whose purpose is stated to be encoding. The concepts of encoding and escaping predate the Web by decades. Given such a context, it is difficult for CWE to adopt a consistent vocabulary that will not be misinterpreted by some constituency.\n\n**[Theoretical]** This is a data/directive boundary error in which data boundaries are not sufficiently enforced before it is sent to a different control sphere.\n\n**[Research Gap]** While many published vulnerabilities are related to insufficient output encoding, there is such an emphasis on input validation as a protection mechanism that the underlying causes are rarely described. Within CVE, the focus is primarily on well-understood issues like cross-site scripting and SQL injection. It is likely that this weakness frequently occurs in custom protocols that support multiple encodings, which are not necessarily detectable with automated techniques.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-41232:** Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)\n- **CVE-2008-4636:** OS command injection in backup software using shell metacharacters in a filename; correct behavior would require that this filename could not be changed.\n- **CVE-2008-0769:** Web application does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nWhen trying to keep information confidential, an attacker can often infer some of the information by using statistics.\n\n### Extended Description\nIn situations where data should not be tied to individual users, but a large number of users should be able to make queries that \"scrub\" the identity of users, it may be possible to get information about a user -- e.g., by specifying search terms that are known to be unique to that user.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1230\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** \n\nThe relationship between CWE-202 and CWE-612 needs to be investigated more closely, as they may be different descriptions of the same kind of problem. CWE-202 is also being considered for deprecation, as it is not clearly described and may have been misunderstood by CWE users. It could be argued that this issue is better covered by CAPEC; an attacker can utilize their data-query privileges to perform this kind of operation, and if the attacker should not be allowed to perform the operation - or if the sensitive data should not have been made accessible at all - then that is more appropriately classified as a separate CWE related to authorization (see the parent, CWE-1230).\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-41935:** Wiki product allows an adversary to discover filenames via a series of queries starting with one letter and then iteratively extending the match.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWeb servers, FTP servers, and similar servers may store a set of files underneath a \"root\" directory that is accessible to the server's users. Applications may store sensitive files underneath this root without also using access control to limit which users may request those files, if any. Alternately, an application might package multiple files or directories into an archive file (e.g., ZIP or tar), but the application might not exclude sensitive files that are underneath those directories.\n\n\nIn cloud technologies and containers, this weakness might present itself in the form of misconfigured storage accounts that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-668\nChildOf -> CWE-668\nChildOf -> CWE-285\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-1835:** Data file under web root.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-209\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-202\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA hash function is defined as an algorithm that maps arbitrarily sized data into a fixed-sized digest (output) such that the following properties hold:\n\n\n  1. The algorithm is not invertible (also called \"one-way\" or \"not reversible\")\n\n  1. The algorithm is deterministic; the same input produces the same digest every time\n\n Building on this definition, a cryptographic hash function must also ensure that a malicious actor cannot leverage the hash function to have a reasonable chance of success at determining any of the following:\n\n  1. the original input (preimage attack), given only the digest\n\n  1. another input that can produce the same digest (2nd preimage attack), given the original input\n\n  1. a set of two or more inputs that evaluate to the same digest (birthday attack), given the actor can arbitrarily choose the inputs to be hashed and can do so a reasonable amount of times\n\nWhat is regarded as \"reasonable\" varies by context and threat model, but in general, \"reasonable\" could cover any attack that is more efficient than brute force (i.e., on average, attempting half of all possible combinations). Note that some attacks might be more efficient than brute force but are still not regarded as achievable in the real world.\n\nAny algorithm that does not meet the above conditions will generally be considered weak for general use in hashing.\n\n\nIn addition to algorithmic weaknesses, a hash function can be made weak by using the hash in a security context that breaks its security guarantees. For example, using a hash function without a salt for storing passwords (that are sufficiently short) could enable an adversary to create a \"rainbow table\" [REF-637] to recover the password under certain conditions; this attack works against such hash functions as MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-326\nChildOf -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries including CWE-328 have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.\n- **CVE-2005-4900:** SHA-1 algorithm is not collision-resistant.\n- **CVE-2020-25685:** DNS product uses a weak hash (CRC32 or SHA-1) of the query name, allowing attacker to forge responses by computing domain names with the same hash.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-620: Unverified Password Change\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nWhen setting a new password for a user, the product does not require knowledge of the original password, or using another form of authentication.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis could be used by an attacker to change passwords for another user, thus gaining the privileges associated with that user.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-0681:** Web app allows remote attackers to change the passwords of arbitrary users without providing the original password, and possibly perform other unauthorized actions.\n- **CVE-2000-0944:** Web application password change utility doesn't check the original password.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen resources are released, they can be made available for reuse. For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.\n\n\nEven when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.\n\n\nThis weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-459\nChildOf -> CWE-212\nCanPrecede -> CWE-201\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).\n\n**[Maintenance]** This entry needs modification to clarify the differences with CWE-212. The description also combines two problems that are distinct from the CWE research perspective: the inadvertent transfer of information to another sphere, and improper initialization/shutdown. Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.\n\n**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release\n- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.\n- **CVE-2003-0291:** router does not clear information from DHCP packets that have been previously used\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nStoring a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.\n\n### Extended Description\nPassword management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-522\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany web applications use template engines that allow developers to insert externally-influenced values into free text or messages in order to generate a full web page, document, message, etc. Such engines include Twig, Jinja2, Pug, Java Server Pages, FreeMarker, Velocity, ColdFusion, Smarty, and many others - including PHP itself. Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nServer-Side Template Injection / SSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a server.\nClient-Side Template Injection / CSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a client.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-94\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

XSS (CWE-79) is also co-located with template injection.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The interrelationships and differences between CWE-917 and CWE-1336 need to be further clarified.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-34359:** Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n- **CVE-2017-16783:** server-side template injection in content management server\n- **CVE-2020-9437:** authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n",

This constitutes an information leak, a violation of confidentiality.\n*   **Lack of Obfuscation:** The system failed to properly obfuscate or mask the user's email address in the reset password confirmation message.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Privacy Violation:** Attackers could obtain valid email addresses for registered users by initiating password reset requests.\n*   **Targeted Attacks:** The disclosed email addresses could be used in phishing attacks, spam campaigns, or other social engineering attacks.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, as it is exploited through the web interface of the XWiki platform.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **No special access required:** An attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any privileges to exploit the vulnerability.\n*   **Knowledge of Username:** The attacker needs to know a valid username on the XWiki instance to trigger the password reset functionality and obtain the associated email address.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the XWiki application to interact with the reset password form.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Versions:** XWiki versions 13.1RC1 and 13.1 are affected.\n*   **Patched Version:** The issue is fixed in version 13.2RC1.\n*   **Vulnerable Code:** The vulnerability was located in `xwiki-platform-web/src/main/webapp/templates/resetpasswordinline.vm`, where the email was not properly obfuscated.\n*   **Patch:** The fix involves modifying the template to obfuscate the email address using `$services.mail.general.obfuscate($email)`.\n*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-200 (Information Exposure).\n*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 (Moderate), with the following metrics: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.\n\nIn summary, this is an information disclosure vulnerability where the reset password form reveals user email addresses to unauthenticated users by not obfuscating them when sending the password reset confirmation message.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 116 | Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.172 |\n| 2 | 202 | Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.170 |\n| 3 | 552 | Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.164 |\n| 4 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.163 |\n| 5 | 328 | Use of Weak Hash | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.146 |\n| 6 | 620 | Unverified Password Change | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.434 |\n| 7 | 226 | Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.145 |\n| 9 | 1336 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.143 |\n| 10 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.139 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nImproper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.\n\n\nMost products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, \"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\" is a structured message containing a command (\"GET\") with a single argument (\"/index.html\") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (\"HTTP/1.1\").\n\n\nIf an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOutput Sanitization\nOutput Validation\nOutput Encoding\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\nCanPrecede -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness is primary to all weaknesses related to injection (CWE-74) since the inherent nature of injection involves the violation of structured messages.\n\n**[Relationship]** \n\nCWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.\n\n\nHowever, input validation is not always sufficient, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\n**[Terminology]** The usage of the \"encoding\" and \"escaping\" terms varies widely. For example, in some programming languages, the terms are used interchangeably, while other languages provide APIs that use both terms for different tasks. This overlapping usage extends to the Web, such as the \"escape\" JavaScript function whose purpose is stated to be encoding. The concepts of encoding and escaping predate the Web by decades. Given such a context, it is difficult for CWE to adopt a consistent vocabulary that will not be misinterpreted by some constituency.\n\n**[Theoretical]** This is a data/directive boundary error in which data boundaries are not sufficiently enforced before it is sent to a different control sphere.\n\n**[Research Gap]** While many published vulnerabilities are related to insufficient output encoding, there is such an emphasis on input validation as a protection mechanism that the underlying causes are rarely described. Within CVE, the focus is primarily on well-understood issues like cross-site scripting and SQL injection. It is likely that this weakness frequently occurs in custom protocols that support multiple encodings, which are not necessarily detectable with automated techniques.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-41232:** Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)\n- **CVE-2008-4636:** OS command injection in backup software using shell metacharacters in a filename; correct behavior would require that this filename could not be changed.\n- **CVE-2008-0769:** Web application does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nWhen trying to keep information confidential, an attacker can often infer some of the information by using statistics.\n\n### Extended Description\nIn situations where data should not be tied to individual users, but a large number of users should be able to make queries that \"scrub\" the identity of users, it may be possible to get information about a user -- e.g., by specifying search terms that are known to be unique to that user.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1230\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** \n\nThe relationship between CWE-202 and CWE-612 needs to be investigated more closely, as they may be different descriptions of the same kind of problem. CWE-202 is also being considered for deprecation, as it is not clearly described and may have been misunderstood by CWE users. It could be argued that this issue is better covered by CAPEC; an attacker can utilize their data-query privileges to perform this kind of operation, and if the attacker should not be allowed to perform the operation - or if the sensitive data should not have been made accessible at all - then that is more appropriately classified as a separate CWE related to authorization (see the parent, CWE-1230).\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-41935:** Wiki product allows an adversary to discover filenames via a series of queries starting with one letter and then iteratively extending the match.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWeb servers, FTP servers, and similar servers may store a set of files underneath a \"root\" directory that is accessible to the server's users. Applications may store sensitive files underneath this root without also using access control to limit which users may request those files, if any. Alternately, an application might package multiple files or directories into an archive file (e.g., ZIP or tar), but the application might not exclude sensitive files that are underneath those directories.\n\n\nIn cloud technologies and containers, this weakness might present itself in the form of misconfigured storage accounts that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-668\nChildOf -> CWE-668\nChildOf -> CWE-285\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA hash function is defined as an algorithm that maps arbitrarily sized data into a fixed-sized digest (output) such that the following properties hold:\n\n\n  1. The algorithm is not invertible (also called \"one-way\" or \"not reversible\")\n\n  1. The algorithm is deterministic; the same input produces the same digest every time\n\n Building on this definition, a cryptographic hash function must also ensure that a malicious actor cannot leverage the hash function to have a reasonable chance of success at determining any of the following:\n\n  1. the original input (preimage attack), given only the digest\n\n  1. another input that can produce the same digest (2nd preimage attack), given the original input\n\n  1. a set of two or more inputs that evaluate to the same digest (birthday attack), given the actor can arbitrarily choose the inputs to be hashed and can do so a reasonable amount of times\n\nWhat is regarded as \"reasonable\" varies by context and threat model, but in general, \"reasonable\" could cover any attack that is more efficient than brute force (i.e., on average, attempting half of all possible combinations). Note that some attacks might be more efficient than brute force but are still not regarded as achievable in the real world.\n\nAny algorithm that does not meet the above conditions will generally be considered weak for general use in hashing.\n\n\nIn addition to algorithmic weaknesses, a hash function can be made weak by using the hash in a security context that breaks its security guarantees. For example, using a hash function without a salt for storing passwords (that are sufficiently short) could enable an adversary to create a \"rainbow table\" [REF-637] to recover the password under certain conditions; this attack works against such hash functions as MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-326\nChildOf -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries including CWE-328 have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.\n- **CVE-2005-4900:** SHA-1 algorithm is not collision-resistant.\n- **CVE-2020-25685:** DNS product uses a weak hash (CRC32 or SHA-1) of the query name, allowing attacker to forge responses by computing domain names with the same hash.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-620: Unverified Password Change\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nWhen setting a new password for a user, the product does not require knowledge of the original password, or using another form of authentication.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis could be used by an attacker to change passwords for another user, thus gaining the privileges associated with that user.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-0681:** Web app allows remote attackers to change the passwords of arbitrary users without providing the original password, and possibly perform other unauthorized actions.\n- **CVE-2000-0944:** Web application password change utility doesn't check the original password.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen resources are released, they can be made available for reuse. For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.\n\n\nEven when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.\n\n\nThis weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-459\nChildOf -> CWE-212\nCanPrecede -> CWE-201\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).\n\n**[Maintenance]** This entry needs modification to clarify the differences with CWE-212. The description also combines two problems that are distinct from the CWE research perspective: the inadvertent transfer of information to another sphere, and improper initialization/shutdown. Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.\n\n**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release\n- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.\n- **CVE-2003-0291:** router does not clear information from DHCP packets that have been previously used\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nStoring a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.\n\n### Extended Description\nPassword management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-522\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nServer-Side Template Injection / SSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a server.\nClient-Side Template Injection / CSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a client.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-94\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

XSS (CWE-79) is also co-located with template injection.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The interrelationships and differences between CWE-917 and CWE-1336 need to be further clarified.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-34359:** Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n- **CVE-2017-16783:** server-side template injection in content management server\n- **CVE-2020-9437:** authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n"
