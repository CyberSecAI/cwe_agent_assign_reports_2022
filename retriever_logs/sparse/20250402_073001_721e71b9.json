This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.\n\n  - Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthorization: The terms \"access control\" and \"authorization\" are often used interchangeably, although many people have distinct definitions. The CWE usage of \"access control\" is intended as a general term for the various mechanisms that restrict which users can access which resources, and \"authorization\" is more narrowly defined. It is unlikely that there will be community consensus on the use of these terms.\n\n### Relationships\nNone\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-284 is extremely high-level, a Pillar. Its name, \"Improper Access Control,\" is often misused in low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287] or by active use of the OWASP Top Ten, such as \"A01:2021-Broken Access Control\". It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** Consider using descendants of CWE-284 that are more specific to the kind of access control involved, such as those involving authorization (Missing Authorization (CWE-862), Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863), Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732), etc.); authentication (Missing Authentication (CWE-306) or Weak Authentication (CWE-1390)); Incorrect User Management (CWE-286); Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints (CWE-923); etc.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n- Abstraction\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication\n- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n- CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** \n\nThis entry needs more work. Possible sub-categories include:\n\n\n  - Trusted group includes undesired entities (partially covered by CWE-286)\n\n  - Group can perform undesired actions\n\n  - ACL parse error does not fail closed\n\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24985:** A form hosting website only checks the session authentication status for a single form, making it possible to bypass authentication when there are multiple forms\n- **CVE-2022-29238:** Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.\n- **CVE-2022-23607:** Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that \"supercookies\" could be sent to any domain on redirect\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\nWhen access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\n HTTP agents or components may include a web server, load balancer, reverse proxy, web caching proxy, application firewall, web browser, etc. Regardless of the role, they are expected to maintain coherent, consistent HTTP communication state across all components. However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response. \n\n\nWhen an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as \"splitting\" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \\r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \\n.\n\n\nIn addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \\t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).\n\n\nThese types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second \"split\" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.\n\n\nHTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:\n\n\n  1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.\n\n  1. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nHTTP Request Splitting\nHTTP Response Splitting\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-93\nCanPrecede -> CWE-79\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nChildOf -> CWE-436\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-15811:** Chain: Proxy uses a substring search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header (CWE-697), allowing request splitting (CWE-113) and cache poisoning\n- **CVE-2021-41084:** Scala-based HTTP interface allows request splitting and response splitting through header names, header values, status reasons, and URIs\n- **CVE-2018-12116:** Javascript-based framework allows request splitting through a path option of an HTTP request\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nRetrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInsecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The \"Insecure Direct Object Reference\" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.\nBroken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.\nHorizontal Authorization: \"Horizontal Authorization\" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-863\nChildOf -> CWE-863\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-36539:** An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nWhen an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nauthentification: An alternate term is \"authentification\", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.\nAuthN: \"AuthN\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authentication\" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from \"AuthZ,\" which is an abbreviation of \"authorization.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\nAuthC: \"AuthC\" is used as an abbreviation of \"authentication,\" but it appears to used less frequently than \"AuthN.\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIf a web product does not properly protect assumed-immutable values from modification in hidden form fields, parameters, cookies, or URLs, this can lead to modification of critical data. Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAssumed-Immutable Parameter Tampering\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-471\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is a primary weakness for many other weaknesses and functional consequences, including XSS, SQL injection, path disclosure, and file inclusion.\n\n**[Theoretical]** This is a technology-specific MAID problem.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-0108:** Forum product allows spoofed messages of other users via hidden form fields for name and e-mail address.\n- **CVE-2000-0253:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n- **CVE-2000-0254:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly protect an assumed-immutable element from being modified by an attacker.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis occurs when a particular input is critical enough to the functioning of the application that it should not be modifiable at all, but it is. Certain resources are often assumed to be immutable when they are not, such as hidden form fields in web applications, cookies, and reverse DNS lookups.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** MAID issues can be primary to many other weaknesses, and they are a major factor in languages that provide easy access to internal program constructs, such as PHP's register_globals and similar features. However, MAID issues can also be resultant from weaknesses that modify internal state; for example, a program might validate some data and store it in memory, but a buffer overflow could overwrite that validated data, leading to a change in program logic.\n\n**[Theoretical]** There are many examples where the MUTABILITY property is a major factor in a vulnerability.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-1757:** Relies on $PHP_SELF variable for authentication.\n- **CVE-2005-1905:** Gain privileges by modifying assumed-immutable code addresses that are accessed by a driver.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThere are many different kinds of mistakes that introduce information exposures. The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include:\n\n\n  - private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details\n\n  - system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages\n\n  - business secrets and intellectual property\n\n  - network status and configuration\n\n  - the product's own code or internal state\n\n  - metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers\n\n  - indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider\n\nInformation might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include:\n\n  - the product's own users\n\n  - people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users\n\n  - the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates\n\n  - the developer\n\nInformation exposures can occur in different ways:\n\n  - the code  **explicitly inserts**  sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been \"scrubbed\" or \"sanitized\"\n\n  - a different weakness or mistake  **indirectly inserts**  the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.\n\n  - the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are  **unintentionally made accessible**  to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.\n\nIt is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInformation Disclosure: This term is frequently used in vulnerability advisories to describe a consequence or technical impact, for any vulnerability that has a loss of confidentiality. Often, CWE-200 can be misused to represent the loss of confidentiality, even when the mistake - i.e., the weakness - is not directly related to the mishandling of the information itself, such as an out-of-bounds read that accesses sensitive memory contents; here, the out-of-bounds read is the primary weakness, not the disclosure of the memory. In addition, this phrase is also used frequently in policies and legal documents, but it does not refer to any disclosure of security-relevant information.\nInformation Leak: This is a frequently used term, however the \"leak\" term has multiple uses within security. In some cases it deals with the accidental exposure of information from a different weakness, but in other cases (such as \"memory leak\"), this deals with improper tracking of resources, which can lead to exhaustion. As a result, CWE is actively avoiding usage of the \"leak\" term.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** If an error or mistake causes information to be disclosed, then use the CWE ID for that error. Consider starting with improper authorization (CWE-285), insecure permissions (CWE-732), improper authentication (CWE-287), etc. Also consider children such as Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201), Observable Discrepancy (CWE-203), Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory (CWE-538), or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** As a result of mapping analysis in the 2020 Top 25 and more recent versions, this weakness is under review, since it is frequently misused in mapping to cover many problems that lead to loss of confidentiality. See Mapping Notes, Extended Description, and Alternate Terms.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-31162:** Rust library leaks Oauth client details in application debug logs\n- **CVE-2021-25476:** Digital Rights Management (DRM) capability for mobile platform leaks pointer information, simplifying ASLR bypass\n- **CVE-2001-1483:** Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-548: Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA directory listing is inappropriately exposed, yielding potentially sensitive information to attackers.\n\n### Extended Description\nA directory listing provides an attacker with the complete index of all the resources located inside of the directory. The specific risks and consequences vary depending on which files are listed and accessible.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-497\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which \"permissions\" are not checked, which is an \"authorization\" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions for files under the \"Program Files\" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.\n- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.\n\n",
