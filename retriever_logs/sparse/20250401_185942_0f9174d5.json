Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** These problems may be resultant from missing sentinel values (CWE-463) or trusting a user-influenced input length variable.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-1733:** Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code\n- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: \"Heartbleed\" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.\n- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1314: Missing Write Protection for Parametric Data Values\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe device does not write-protect the parametric data values for sensors that scale the sensor value, allowing untrusted software to manipulate the apparent result and potentially damage hardware or cause operational failure.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nVarious sensors are used by hardware to detect any devices operating outside of the design limits. The threshold limit values are set by hardware fuses or trusted software such as the BIOS. These limits may be related to thermal, power, voltage, current, and frequency. Hardware mechanisms may be used to protect against alteration of the threshold limit values by untrusted software.\n\n\nThe limit values are generally programmed in standard units for the type of value being read. However, the hardware-sensor blocks may report the settings in different units depending upon sensor design and operation. The raw sensor output value is converted to the desired units using a scale conversion based on the parametric data programmed into the sensor. The final converted value is then compared with the previously programmed limits.\n\n\nWhile the limit values are usually protected, the sensor parametric data values may not be. By changing the parametric data, safe operational limits may be bypassed.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-862\nPeerOf -> CWE-1299\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2017-8252:** Kernel can inject faults in computations during the execution of TrustZone leading to information disclosure in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer Electronics Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice and Music, Snapdragon Wearables, Snapdragon Wired Infrastructure and Networking.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nTOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to \"Time Of Check To Time Of Use\".\nTOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nChildOf -> CWE-362\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.\n- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSpecified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-789\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

If an attacker can force the function to fail or otherwise return a value that is not expected, then the subsequent program logic could lead to a vulnerability, because the product is not in a state that the programmer assumes. For example, if the program calls a function to drop privileges but does not check the return code to ensure that privileges were successfully dropped, then the program will continue to operate with the higher privileges.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-754\nChildOf -> CWE-754\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

When untrusted input is not properly validated before it is used as an index, attackers could access (or attempt to access) unauthorized portions of these resources. This could be used to cause buffer overflows, excessive resource allocation, or trigger unexpected failures. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

If the pointer is dereferenced for a write operation, the attack might allow modification of critical state variables, cause a crash, or execute code. If the dereferencing operation is for a read, then the attack might allow reading of sensitive data, cause a crash, or set a variable to an unexpected value (since the value will be read from an unexpected memory location).\n\n\nThere are several variants of this weakness, including but not necessarily limited to:\n\n\n  - The untrusted value is directly invoked as a function call.\n\n  - In OS kernels or drivers where there is a boundary between \"userland\" and privileged memory spaces, an untrusted pointer might enter through an API or system call (see CWE-781 for one such example).\n\n  - Inadvertently accepting the value from an untrusted control sphere when it did not have to be accepted as input at all. This might occur when the code was originally developed to be run by a single user in a non-networked environment, and the code is then ported to or otherwise exposed to a networked environment.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-125\nCanPrecede -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.\n\n**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of \"memory corruption\" or \"memory safety.\" As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-5655:** message-passing framework interprets values in packets as pointers, causing a crash.\n- **CVE-2010-2299:** labeled as a \"type confusion\" issue, also referred to as a \"stale pointer.\" However, the bug ID says \"contents are simply interpreted as a pointer... renderer ordinarily doesn't supply this pointer directly\". The \"handle\" in the untrusted area is replaced in one function, but not another - thus also, effectively, exposure to wrong sphere (CWE-668).\n- **CVE-2009-1719:** Untrusted dereference using undocumented constructor.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nInput validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components. When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInput validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\n\nInput validation can be applied to:\n\n\n  - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\n  - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\nData can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.\n\nMany properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:\n\n\n  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\n  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\n  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\n  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\n  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\n  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\n  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\n  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\n  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\n  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\n  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\nImplied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. \n\nNote that \"input validation\" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.\n\n\nFinally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\nPeerOf -> CWE-345\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-74\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-770\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider lower-level children such as Improper Use of Validation Framework (CWE-1173) or improper validation involving specific types or properties of input such as Specified Quantity (CWE-1284); Specified Index, Position, or Offset (CWE-1285); Syntactic Correctness (CWE-1286); Specified Type (CWE-1287); Consistency within Input (CWE-1288); or Unsafe Equivalence (CWE-1289).\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1284: Specified Quantity\n- CWE-1285: Specified Index, Position, or Offset\n- CWE-1286: Syntactic Correctness\n- CWE-1287: Specified Type\n- CWE-1288: Consistency within Input\n- CWE-1289: Unsafe Equivalence\n- CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nCWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** As of 2020, this entry is used more often than preferred, and it is a source of frequent confusion. It is being actively modified for CWE 4.1 and subsequent versions.\n\n**[Maintenance]** Concepts such as validation, data transformation, and neutralization are being refined, so relationships between CWE-20 and other entries such as CWE-707 may change in future versions, along with an update to the Vulnerability Theory document.\n\n**[Maintenance]** Input validation - whether missing or incorrect - is such an essential and widespread part of secure development that it is implicit in many different weaknesses. Traditionally, problems such as buffer overflows and XSS have been classified as input validation problems by many security professionals. However, input validation is not necessarily the only protection mechanism available for avoiding such problems, and in some cases it is not even sufficient. The CWE team has begun capturing these subtleties in chains within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000), but more work is needed.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nThe \"input validation\" term is extremely common, but it is used in many different ways. In some cases its usage can obscure the real underlying weakness or otherwise hide chaining and composite relationships.\n\n\nSome people use \"input validation\" as a general term that covers many different neutralization techniques for ensuring that input is appropriate, such as filtering, canonicalization, and escaping. Others use the term in a more narrow context to simply mean \"checking if an input conforms to expectations without changing it.\" CWE uses this more narrow interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2021-30860:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190) in mobile OS, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a program calls free() twice with the same argument, the program's memory management data structures become corrupted. This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer. If malloc() returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDouble-free\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-825\nChildOf -> CWE-1341\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-666\nPeerOf -> CWE-416\nPeerOf -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is usually resultant from another weakness, such as an unhandled error or race condition between threads. It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.\n\n**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of \"Use after Free\", but \"Use\" and \"Release\" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately \"Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release\", which doesn't exist yet.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n- **CVE-2004-0642:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n- **CVE-2004-0772:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n\n",

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** These problems may be resultant from missing sentinel values (CWE-463) or trusting a user-influenced input length variable.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-1733:** Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code\n- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: \"Heartbleed\" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.\n- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1314: Missing Write Protection for Parametric Data Values\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe device does not write-protect the parametric data values for sensors that scale the sensor value, allowing untrusted software to manipulate the apparent result and potentially damage hardware or cause operational failure.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nVarious sensors are used by hardware to detect any devices operating outside of the design limits. The threshold limit values are set by hardware fuses or trusted software such as the BIOS. These limits may be related to thermal, power, voltage, current, and frequency. Hardware mechanisms may be used to protect against alteration of the threshold limit values by untrusted software.\n\n\nThe limit values are generally programmed in standard units for the type of value being read. However, the hardware-sensor blocks may report the settings in different units depending upon sensor design and operation. The raw sensor output value is converted to the desired units using a scale conversion based on the parametric data programmed into the sensor. The final converted value is then compared with the previously programmed limits.\n\n\nWhile the limit values are usually protected, the sensor parametric data values may not be. By changing the parametric data, safe operational limits may be bypassed.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-862\nPeerOf -> CWE-1299\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2017-8252:** Kernel can inject faults in computations during the execution of TrustZone leading to information disclosure in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer Electronics Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice and Music, Snapdragon Wearables, Snapdragon Wired Infrastructure and Networking.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nTOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to \"Time Of Check To Time Of Use\".\nTOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nChildOf -> CWE-362\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.\n- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSpecified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-789\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

If an attacker can force the function to fail or otherwise return a value that is not expected, then the subsequent program logic could lead to a vulnerability, because the product is not in a state that the programmer assumes. For example, if the program calls a function to drop privileges but does not check the return code to ensure that privileges were successfully dropped, then the program will continue to operate with the higher privileges.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-754\nChildOf -> CWE-754\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

When untrusted input is not properly validated before it is used as an index, attackers could access (or attempt to access) unauthorized portions of these resources. This could be used to cause buffer overflows, excessive resource allocation, or trigger unexpected failures. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

If the pointer is dereferenced for a write operation, the attack might allow modification of critical state variables, cause a crash, or execute code. If the dereferencing operation is for a read, then the attack might allow reading of sensitive data, cause a crash, or set a variable to an unexpected value (since the value will be read from an unexpected memory location).\n\n\nThere are several variants of this weakness, including but not necessarily limited to:\n\n\n  - The untrusted value is directly invoked as a function call.\n\n  - In OS kernels or drivers where there is a boundary between \"userland\" and privileged memory spaces, an untrusted pointer might enter through an API or system call (see CWE-781 for one such example).\n\n  - Inadvertently accepting the value from an untrusted control sphere when it did not have to be accepted as input at all. This might occur when the code was originally developed to be run by a single user in a non-networked environment, and the code is then ported to or otherwise exposed to a networked environment.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-125\nCanPrecede -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.\n\n**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of \"memory corruption\" or \"memory safety.\" As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-5655:** message-passing framework interprets values in packets as pointers, causing a crash.\n- **CVE-2010-2299:** labeled as a \"type confusion\" issue, also referred to as a \"stale pointer.\" However, the bug ID says \"contents are simply interpreted as a pointer... renderer ordinarily doesn't supply this pointer directly\". The \"handle\" in the untrusted area is replaced in one function, but not another - thus also, effectively, exposure to wrong sphere (CWE-668).\n- **CVE-2009-1719:** Untrusted dereference using undocumented constructor.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nInput validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components. When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInput validation is not the only technique for processing input, however. Other techniques attempt to transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well (see CWE-138 for more examples.)\n\n\nInput validation can be applied to:\n\n\n  - raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.\n\n  - metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size\n\nData can be simple or structured. Structured data can be composed of many nested layers, composed of combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or structured data.\n\nMany properties of raw data or metadata may need to be validated upon entry into the code, such as:\n\n\n  - specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.\n\n  - implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size\n\n  - indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures\n\n  - symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.\n\n  - well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax \n\n  - lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token\n\n  - specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)\n\n  - consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.\n\n  - conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic \n\n  - equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same\n\n  - authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data\n\nImplied or derived properties of data must often be calculated or inferred by the code itself. Errors in deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor to improper input validation. \n\nNote that \"input validation\" has very different meanings to different people, or within different classification schemes. Caution must be used when referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it. For example, some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control to an attacker over an input when they should not be able to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred to as input validation.\n\n\nFinally, it is important to emphasize that the distinctions between input validation and output escaping are often blurred, and developers must be careful to understand the difference, including how input validation is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, this valid name cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\nPeerOf -> CWE-345\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-74\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-770\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider lower-level children such as Improper Use of Validation Framework (CWE-1173) or improper validation involving specific types or properties of input such as Specified Quantity (CWE-1284); Specified Index, Position, or Offset (CWE-1285); Syntactic Correctness (CWE-1286); Specified Type (CWE-1287); Consistency within Input (CWE-1288); or Unsafe Equivalence (CWE-1289).\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1284: Specified Quantity\n- CWE-1285: Specified Index, Position, or Offset\n- CWE-1286: Syntactic Correctness\n- CWE-1287: Specified Type\n- CWE-1288: Consistency within Input\n- CWE-1289: Unsafe Equivalence\n- CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nCWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** As of 2020, this entry is used more often than preferred, and it is a source of frequent confusion. It is being actively modified for CWE 4.1 and subsequent versions.\n\n**[Maintenance]** Concepts such as validation, data transformation, and neutralization are being refined, so relationships between CWE-20 and other entries such as CWE-707 may change in future versions, along with an update to the Vulnerability Theory document.\n\n**[Maintenance]** Input validation - whether missing or incorrect - is such an essential and widespread part of secure development that it is implicit in many different weaknesses. Traditionally, problems such as buffer overflows and XSS have been classified as input validation problems by many security professionals. However, input validation is not necessarily the only protection mechanism available for avoiding such problems, and in some cases it is not even sufficient. The CWE team has begun capturing these subtleties in chains within the Research Concepts view (CWE-1000), but more work is needed.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nThe \"input validation\" term is extremely common, but it is used in many different ways. In some cases its usage can obscure the real underlying weakness or otherwise hide chaining and composite relationships.\n\n\nSome people use \"input validation\" as a general term that covers many different neutralization techniques for ensuring that input is appropriate, such as filtering, canonicalization, and escaping. Others use the term in a more narrow context to simply mean \"checking if an input conforms to expectations without changing it.\" CWE uses this more narrow interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2021-30860:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190) in mobile OS, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a program calls free() twice with the same argument, the program's memory management data structures become corrupted. This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer. If malloc() returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDouble-free\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-825\nChildOf -> CWE-1341\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-666\nPeerOf -> CWE-416\nPeerOf -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is usually resultant from another weakness, such as an unhandled error or race condition between threads. It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.\n\n**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of \"Use after Free\", but \"Use\" and \"Release\" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately \"Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release\", which doesn't exist yet.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n- **CVE-2004-0642:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n- **CVE-2004-0772:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n\n"
