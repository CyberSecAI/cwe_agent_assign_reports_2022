The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **weakness:** **cipher leak**\n- **product:** ImageMagick\n- **version:** before 7.0.11\n- **component:** calculate signatures in TransformSignature\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20313:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a potential cipher leak within the `TransformSignature` function located in `MagickCore/signature.c`. Specifically, the issue occurs during the calculation of signatures.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Cipher Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a potential leak of sensitive cipher data. This suggests that during the signature calculation process, some of the cipher's internal state or intermediate values might be exposed.\n*   The code uses `memset` to clear the `W` array but this can be optimized away by the compiler.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Data Confidentiality:** The most significant impact of this vulnerability is a breach of data confidentiality. If an attacker can successfully exploit the cipher leak, they might gain access to sensitive information that is supposed to be protected by the cipher.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Crafted Image Files:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted image file to an application using ImageMagick, triggering the vulnerable signature calculation process.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Ability to Submit Crafted Files:** An attacker needs to be able to submit a specially crafted image file to a system that uses a vulnerable version of ImageMagick. This means the attacker needs to be able to interact with software or systems that use ImageMagick to process images.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The provided commit log shows changes in `MagickCore/signature.c` where `memset` is replaced with `ResetMagickMemory`.  Additionally, `MagickCore/memory.c` was changed to define `ResetMagickMemory` using a volatile pointer to prevent compiler optimizations.\n*   The issue was fixed in ImageMagick version 7.0.11.\n*   The Debian LTS advisory confirms that this CVE is related to a potential cipher leak in the `TransformSignature` function.\n*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry confirms the cipher leak in `MagickCore/signature.c`.\n*  The fix prevents compiler optimizations from removing the buffer clearing\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 14 | Compiler Removal of Code to Clear Buffers | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.350 |\n| 2 | 401 | Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.209 |\n| 3 | 1240 | Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.205 |\n| 4 | 327 | Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.204 |\n| 5 | 208 | Observable Timing Discrepancy | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.202 |\n| 6 | 347 | Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.542 |\n| 7 | 385 | Covert Timing Channel | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 125 | Out-of-bounds Read | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.202 |\n| 9 | 200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.201 |\n| 10 | 1204 | Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV) | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.199 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-14: Compiler Removal of Code to Clear Buffers\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nSensitive memory is cleared according to the source code, but compiler optimizations leave the memory untouched when it is not read from again, aka \"dead store removal.\"\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis compiler optimization error occurs when:\n\n\n  1. Secret data are stored in memory.\n\n  1. The secret data are scrubbed from memory by overwriting its contents.\n\n  1. The source code is compiled using an optimizing compiler, which identifies and removes the function that overwrites the contents as a dead store because the memory is not used subsequently.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-733\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

In some languages, developers are responsible for tracking memory allocation and releasing the memory. If there are no more pointers or references to the memory, then it can no longer be tracked and identified for release.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nMemory Leak\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-772\nChildOf -> CWE-404\nChildOf -> CWE-404\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is often a resultant weakness due to improper handling of malformed data or early termination of sessions.\n\n**[Terminology]** \"memory leak\" has sometimes been used to describe other kinds of issues, e.g. for information leaks in which the contents of memory are inadvertently leaked (CVE-2003-0400 is one such example of this terminology conflict).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-3119:** Memory leak because function does not free() an element of a data structure.\n- **CVE-2004-0427:** Memory leak when counter variable is not decremented.\n- **CVE-2002-0574:** chain: reference count is not decremented, leading to memory leak in OS by sending ICMP packets.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCryptographic protocols and systems depend on cryptographic primitives (and associated algorithms) as their basic building blocks. Some common examples of primitives are digital signatures, one-way hash functions, ciphers, and public key cryptography; however, the notion of \"primitive\" can vary depending on point of view. See \"Terminology Notes\" for further explanation of some concepts.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives are defined to accomplish one very specific task in a precisely defined and mathematically reliable fashion. For example, suppose that for a specific cryptographic primitive (such as an encryption routine), the consensus is that the primitive can only be broken after trying out N different inputs (where the larger the value of N, the stronger the cryptography). For an encryption scheme like AES-256, one would expect N to be so large as to be infeasible to execute in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n\nIf a vulnerability is ever found that shows that one can break a cryptographic primitive in significantly less than the expected number of attempts, then that primitive is considered weakened (or sometimes in extreme cases, colloquially it is \"broken\"). As a result, anything using this cryptographic primitive would now be considered insecure or risky. Thus, even breaking or weakening a seemingly small cryptographic primitive has the potential to render the whole system vulnerable, due to its reliance on the primitive. A historical example can be found in TLS when using DES. One would colloquially call DES the cryptographic primitive for transport encryption in this version of TLS. In the past, DES was considered strong, because no weaknesses were found in it; importantly, DES has a key length of 56 bits. Trying N=2^56 keys was considered impractical for most actors. Unfortunately, attacking a system with 56-bit keys is now practical via brute force, which makes defeating DES encryption practical. It is now practical for an adversary to read any information sent under this version of TLS and use this information to attack the system. As a result, it can be claimed that this use of TLS is weak, and that any system depending on TLS with DES could potentially render the entire system vulnerable to attack.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are only considered safe after extensive research and review from experienced cryptographers from academia, industry, and government entities looking for any possible flaws. Furthermore, cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are frequently reevaluated for safety when new mathematical and attack techniques are discovered. As a result and over time, even well-known cryptographic primitives can lose their compliance status with the discovery of novel attacks that might either defeat the algorithm or reduce its robustness significantly.\n\n\nIf ad-hoc cryptographic primitives are implemented, it is almost certain that the implementation will be vulnerable to attacks that are well understood by cryptographers, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information and other consequences.\n\n\nThis weakness is even more difficult to manage for hardware-implemented deployment of cryptographic algorithms. First, because hardware is not patchable as easily as software, any flaw discovered after release and production typically cannot be fixed without a recall of the product. Secondly, the hardware product is often expected to work for years, during which time computation power available to the attacker only increases. Therefore, for hardware implementations of cryptographic primitives, it is absolutely essential that only strong, proven cryptographic primitives are used.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\n Terminology for cryptography varies widely, from informal and colloquial to mathematically-defined, with different precision and formalism depending on whether the stakeholder is a developer, cryptologist, etc. Yet there is a need for CWE to be self-consistent while remaining understandable and acceptable to multiple audiences.\n\n\nAs of CWE 4.6, CWE terminology around \"primitives\" and \"algorithms\" is emerging as shown by the following example, subject to future consultation and agreement within the CWE and cryptography communities. Suppose one wishes to send encrypted data using a CLI tool such as OpenSSL. One might choose to use AES with a 256-bit key and require tamper protection (GCM mode, for instance). For compatibility's sake, one might also choose the ciphertext to be formatted to the PKCS#5 standard. In this case, the \"cryptographic system\" would be AES-256-GCM with PKCS#5 formatting. The \"cryptographic function\" would be AES-256 in the GCM mode of operation, and the \"algorithm\" would be AES. Colloquially, one would say that AES (and sometimes AES-256) is the \"cryptographic primitive,\" because it is the algorithm that realizes the concept of symmetric encryption (without modes of operation or other protocol related modifications). In practice, developers and architects typically refer to base cryptographic algorithms (AES, SHA, etc.) as cryptographic primitives.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-4778:** software uses MD5, which is less safe than the default SHA-256 used by related products\n- **CVE-2005-2946:** Default configuration of product uses MD5 instead of stronger algorithms that are available, simplifying forgery of certificates.\n- **CVE-2019-3907:** identity card uses MD5 hash of a salt and password\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\n\n\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \"unsafe\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\n\n\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\nPeerOf -> CWE-311\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30273:** SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity\n- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.\n- **CVE-2008-3775:** Product uses \"ROT-25\" to obfuscate the password in the registry.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n### Extended Description\nIn security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-203\nCanPrecede -> CWE-385\nCanPrecede -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Often primary in cryptographic applications and algorithms.\n\n**[Maintenance]** CWE 4.16 removed a demonstrative example for a hardware module because it was inaccurate and unable to be adapted. The CWE team is developing an alternative.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies\n- **CVE-2019-10482:** Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels\n- **CVE-2014-0984:** Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-345\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Also, externally monitoring the timing of operations can potentially reveal sensitive data. For example, a cryptographic operation can expose its internal state if the time it takes to perform the operation varies, based on the state.\n\n\nCovert channels are frequently classified as either storage or timing channels. Some examples of covert timing channels are the system's paging rate, the time a certain transaction requires to execute, and the time it takes to gain access to a shared bus.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-514\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

As a result of that work, this entry might change in CWE 4.10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOOB read: Shorthand for \"Out of bounds\" read\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.\n- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: \"Heartbleed\" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThere are many different kinds of mistakes that introduce information exposures. The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include:\n\n\n  - private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details\n\n  - system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages\n\n  - business secrets and intellectual property\n\n  - network status and configuration\n\n  - the product's own code or internal state\n\n  - metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers\n\n  - indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider\n\nInformation might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include:\n\n  - the product's own users\n\n  - people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users\n\n  - the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates\n\n  - the developer\n\nInformation exposures can occur in different ways:\n\n  - the code  **explicitly inserts**  sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been \"scrubbed\" or \"sanitized\"\n\n  - a different weakness or mistake  **indirectly inserts**  the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.\n\n  - the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are  **unintentionally made accessible**  to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.\n\nIt is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInformation Disclosure: This term is frequently used in vulnerability advisories to describe a consequence or technical impact, for any vulnerability that has a loss of confidentiality. Often, CWE-200 can be misused to represent the loss of confidentiality, even when the mistake - i.e., the weakness - is not directly related to the mishandling of the information itself, such as an out-of-bounds read that accesses sensitive memory contents; here, the out-of-bounds read is the primary weakness, not the disclosure of the memory. In addition, this phrase is also used frequently in policies and legal documents, but it does not refer to any disclosure of security-relevant information.\nInformation Leak: This is a frequently used term, however the \"leak\" term has multiple uses within security. In some cases it deals with the accidental exposure of information from a different weakness, but in other cases (such as \"memory leak\"), this deals with improper tracking of resources, which can lead to exhaustion. As a result, CWE is actively avoiding usage of the \"leak\" term.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** If an error or mistake causes information to be disclosed, then use the CWE ID for that error. Consider starting with improper authorization (CWE-285), insecure permissions (CWE-732), improper authentication (CWE-287), etc. Also consider children such as Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201), Observable Discrepancy (CWE-203), Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory (CWE-538), or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** As a result of mapping analysis in the 2020 Top 25 and more recent versions, this weakness is under review, since it is frequently misused in mapping to cover many problems that lead to loss of confidentiality. See Mapping Notes, Extended Description, and Alternate Terms.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-31162:** Rust library leaks Oauth client details in application debug logs\n- **CVE-2021-25476:** Digital Rights Management (DRM) capability for mobile platform leaks pointer information, simplifying ASLR bypass\n- **CVE-2001-1483:** Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization\n\t\t\tVector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are\n\t\t\tsufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected\n\t\t\tcryptographic requirements for that primitive.\n\t\t\t\n\n### Extended Description\nBy design, some cryptographic primitives (such as block ciphers) require that IVs must have certain properties for the uniqueness and/or unpredictability of an IV. Primitives may vary in how important these properties are. If these properties are not maintained, e.g. by a bug in the code, then the cryptography may be weakened or broken by attacking the IVs themselves.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-330\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, \"randomness\" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, \"entropy\" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-1472:** ZeroLogon vulnerability - use of a static IV of all zeroes in AES-CFB8 mode\n- **CVE-2011-3389:** BEAST attack in SSL 3.0 / TLS 1.0. In CBC mode, chained initialization vectors are non-random, allowing decryption of HTTPS traffic using a chosen plaintext attack.\n- **CVE-2001-0161:** wireless router does not use 6 of the 24 bits for WEP encryption, making it easier for attackers to decrypt traffic\n\n",
