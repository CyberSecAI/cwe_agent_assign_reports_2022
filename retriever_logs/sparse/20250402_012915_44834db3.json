It was discovered that php files could still be uploaded by changing the file extensions case, for example, from php to pHP.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **improper file type validation**\n- **impact:** execute PHP files on server\n- **vector:** changing file extension case\n- **product:** SP Project & Document Manager WordPress plugin\n- **version:** before 4.22\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24347:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- Inadequate file extension check: The plugin attempts to prevent the upload of potentially dangerous files (like PHP files) by checking their extensions. However, this check is case-sensitive, allowing attackers to bypass it by changing the case of the extension (e.g., from \"php\" to \"pHP\").\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Case-sensitive file extension validation: The plugin fails to properly sanitize file uploads, allowing users to upload files that should be blocked by simply changing the case of the file extension\n- Unrestricted file uploads (to an extent): The plugin advertises allowing users to upload and manage files without limits, but also attempts (inadequately) to block certain file types\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By uploading a PHP webshell, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- File upload vulnerability: The vulnerability is triggered through the plugin's file upload functionality.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site to access the file upload feature.\n- Intercept and modify requests: The attacker needs to be able to intercept the file upload request and modify the filename parameter before sending it to the server.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 178 | Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.526 |\n| 2 | 434 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.457 |\n| 3 | 425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.394 |\n| 4 | 79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.374 |\n| 5 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.372 |\n| 6 | 646 | Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.498 |\n| 7 | 430 | Deployment of Wrong Handler | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.370 |\n| 9 | 22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.368 |\n| 10 | 639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.358 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly account for differences in case sensitivity when accessing or determining the properties of a resource, leading to inconsistent results.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nImproperly handled case sensitive data can lead to several possible consequences, including:\n\n\n  - case-insensitive passwords reducing the size of the key space, making brute force attacks easier\n\n  - bypassing filters or access controls using alternate names\n\n  - multiple interpretation errors using alternate names.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nCanPrecede -> CWE-433\nCanPrecede -> CWE-289\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

JSP source code may be read because .JSP defaults to the filetype \"text\".\n- **CVE-2000-0498:** The server is case sensitive, so filetype handlers treat .jsp and .JSP as different extensions. JSP source code may be read because .JSP defaults to the filetype \"text\".\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nUnrestricted File Upload: Used in vulnerability databases and elsewhere, but it is insufficiently precise. The phrase could be interpreted as the lack of restrictions on the size or number of uploaded files, which is a resource consumption issue.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-669\nChildOf -> CWE-669\nPeerOf -> CWE-351\nPeerOf -> CWE-436\nPeerOf -> CWE-430\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThis can have a chaining relationship with incomplete denylist / permissive allowlist errors when the product tries, but fails, to properly limit which types of files are allowed (CWE-183, CWE-184).\n\n\nThis can also overlap multiple interpretation errors for intermediaries, e.g. anti-virus products that do not remove or quarantine attachments with certain file extensions that can be processed by client systems.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-5227:** PHP-based FAQ management app does not check the MIME type for uploaded images\n- **CVE-2001-0901:** Web-based mail product stores \".shtml\" attachments that could contain SSI\n- **CVE-2002-1841:** PHP upload does not restrict file types\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n### Extended Description\nWeb applications susceptible to direct request attacks often make the false assumption that such resources can only be reached through a given navigation path and so only apply authorization at certain points in the path.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nforced browsing: The \"forced browsing\" term could be misinterpreted to include weaknesses such as CSRF or XSS, so its use is discouraged.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-862\nChildOf -> CWE-862\nChildOf -> CWE-288\nChildOf -> CWE-424\nCanPrecede -> CWE-471\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Overlaps Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID), authorization errors, container errors; often primary to other weaknesses such as XSS and SQL injection.\n\n**[Theoretical]** \"Forced browsing\" is a step-based manipulation involving the omission of one or more steps, whose order is assumed to be immutable. The application does not verify that the first step was performed successfully before the second step. The consequence is typically \"authentication bypass\" or \"path disclosure,\" although it can be primary to all kinds of weaknesses, especially in languages such as PHP, which allow external modification of assumed-immutable variables.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29238:** Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.\n- **CVE-2022-23607:** Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that \"supercookies\" could be sent to any domain on redirect.\n- **CVE-2004-2144:** Bypass authentication via direct request.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nXSS: A common abbreviation for Cross-Site Scripting.\nHTML Injection: Used as a synonym of stored (Type 2) XSS.\nCSS: In the early years after initial discovery of XSS, \"CSS\" was a commonly-used acronym. However, this would cause confusion with \"Cascading Style Sheets,\" so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nCanPrecede -> CWE-494\nPeerOf -> CWE-352\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThere can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.\n\n\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nXSS flaws are very common in web applications, since they require a great deal of developer discipline to avoid them.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-25926:** Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.\n- **CVE-2021-25963:** Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n- **CVE-2021-1879:** Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-646: Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product allows a file to be uploaded, but it relies on the file name or extension of the file to determine the appropriate behaviors. This could be used by attackers to cause the file to be misclassified and processed in a dangerous fashion.\n\n### Extended Description\nAn application might use the file name or extension of a user-supplied file to determine the proper course of action, such as selecting the correct process to which control should be passed, deciding what data should be made available, or what resources should be allocated. If the attacker can cause the code to misclassify the supplied file, then the wrong action could occur. For example, an attacker could supply a file that ends in a \".php.gif\" extension that appears to be a GIF image, but would be processed as PHP code. In extreme cases, code execution is possible, but the attacker could also cause exhaustion of resources, denial of service, exposure of debug or system data (including application source code), or being bound to a particular server side process. This weakness may be due to a vulnerability in any of the technologies used by the web and application servers, due to misconfiguration, or resultant from another flaw in the application itself.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-430: Deployment of Wrong Handler\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe wrong \"handler\" is assigned to process an object.\n\n### Extended Description\nAn example of deploying the wrong handler would be calling a servlet to reveal source code of a .JSP file, or automatically \"determining\" type of the object even if it is contradictory to an explicitly specified type.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-691\nCanPrecede -> CWE-433\nPeerOf -> CWE-434\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-0004:** Source code disclosure via manipulated file extension that causes parsing by wrong DLL.\n- **CVE-2002-0025:** Web browser does not properly handle the Content-Type header field, causing a different application to process the document.\n- **CVE-2000-1052:** Source code disclosure by directly invoking a servlet.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)\n- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.\n- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDirectory traversal\nPath traversal: \"Path traversal\" is preferred over \"directory traversal,\" but both terms are attack-focused.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.\n\n**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.\n\n**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing \"/\" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nLike other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use \"directory traversal\" only to refer to the injection of \"..\" and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.\n\n\nOther variants like \"absolute pathname\" and \"drive letter\" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve \"..\" or equivalent.\n\n\n**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nIncomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that \"..\\\" is vulnerable, but not test \"../\" which may also be vulnerable.\n\n\nAny combination of directory separators (\"/\", \"\\\", etc.) and numbers of \".\" (e.g. \"....\") can produce unique variants; for example, the \"//../\" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the \"\\\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nRetrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInsecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The \"Insecure Direct Object Reference\" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.\nBroken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.\nHorizontal Authorization: \"Horizontal Authorization\" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-863\nChildOf -> CWE-863\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
