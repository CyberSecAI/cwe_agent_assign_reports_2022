A specially crafted malformed file can lead to an **out-of-bounds read** and **type confusion**, which could lead to code execution. An attacker can provide malicious input to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## WEAKNESS: 'out-of-bounds read'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1. CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index (Score: 800.04)\n\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array....\n\n### 2. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Score: 582.30)\n\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....\n\n### 3. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 383.17)\n\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to st...\n\n### 4.
