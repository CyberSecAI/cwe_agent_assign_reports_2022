CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency (Score: 343.08)\n\nThe product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data....\n\n### 2. CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound) (Score: 283.80)\n\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result....\n\n### 3. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 282.42)\n\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....\n\n### 4. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 274.62)\n\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....\n\n### 5. CWE-126: Buffer Over-read (Score: 246.69)\n\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer....\n\n## WEAKNESS: 'Stack-based Buffer Overflow'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.
