Specifically, the system does not prevent the inclusion of `.htaccess` files within the uploaded zip archive.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system allows the upload of arbitrary files within a zip archive, including `.htaccess`.\n- **htaccess Processing:** The webserver processes the uploaded `.htaccess` file, allowing an attacker to redefine how specific file extensions are handled (e.g. `.phx`).\n- **Remote Code Execution:** By adding a handler for a custom extension and uploading a file with this extension and malicious code, an attacker can achieve remote code execution.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially compromising the entire system.\n- **Full System Compromise:** With RCE, attackers can gain control of the server, access sensitive data, modify system configurations, and perform other malicious activities.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **File Upload:** Attackers upload a specially crafted zip file via the `course_intro_pdf_import.php` interface.\n- **Zip File Contents:** The zip file contains a malicious `.htaccess` file and a file with a custom extension containing malicious PHP code.\n- **Web Request:** The attacker accesses the uploaded file via the web server which then executes the malicious php.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Authenticated Admin Access:** The attacker must have administrator-level privileges to access the `course_intro_pdf_import.php` functionality.\n- **Web Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Chamilo LMS instance.\n\n**Additional Technical Details:**\n- The attacker uploads a zip file containing a `.htaccess` file and a malicious php file (e.g., `test.phx`).\n- The `.htaccess` file is used to add a PHP handler for the `.phx` extension.\n- The uploaded zip archive's contents are extracted into `/app/cache/pdfimport/`.\n- The attacker can then access the malicious php file via a web request (e.g., `/app/cache/pdfimport/test.phx`) which executes the php code within.\n- A race condition was also reported, which was also later fixed, this is not detailed in the provided content but it was fixed in a later commit.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- The vulnerability was addressed by preventing the upload of dangerous files (like `.htaccess`).\n- The commit [2e5c004b57d551678a1815500ef91524ba7bb757](https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms/commit/2e5c004b57d551678a1815500ef91524ba7bb757) added `disable_dangerous_file` in `unzip_uploaded_file` function, which is used to block the upload of .htaccess files.\n- The commit [905a21037ebc9bc5369f0fb380177cb56f496f5c](https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms/commit/905a21037ebc9bc5369f0fb380177cb56f496f5c) disables .htaccess files, fixes flash messages, fixes php warnings, and removes the error log.\n\nThis detailed explanation is more comprehensive than the original CVE description placeholder.\n\n##

Description\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-94\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \"HTML injection\" (see CWE-79: XSS) could be thought of as an example of this, but the code is injected and executed on the client side, not the server side. Server-Side Includes (SSI) are an example of direct static code injection.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-0495:** Perl code directly injected into CGI library file from parameters to another CGI program.\n- **CVE-2005-1876:** Direct PHP code injection into supporting template file.\n- **CVE-2005-1894:** Direct code injection into PHP script that can be accessed by attacker.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nUnrestricted File Upload: Used in vulnerability databases and elsewhere, but it is insufficiently precise. The phrase could be interpreted as the lack of restrictions on the size or number of uploaded files, which is a resource consumption issue.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-669\nChildOf -> CWE-669\nPeerOf -> CWE-351\nPeerOf -> CWE-436\nPeerOf -> CWE-430\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThis can have a chaining relationship with incomplete denylist / permissive allowlist errors when the product tries, but fails, to properly limit which types of files are allowed (CWE-183, CWE-184).\n\n\nThis can also overlap multiple interpretation errors for intermediaries, e.g. anti-virus products that do not remove or quarantine attachments with certain file extensions that can be processed by client systems.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-5227:** PHP-based FAQ management app does not check the MIME type for uploaded images\n- **CVE-2001-0901:** Web-based mail product stores \".shtml\" attachments that could contain SSI\n- **CVE-2002-1841:** PHP upload does not restrict file types\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen a product allows a user's input to contain code syntax, it might be possible for an attacker to craft the code in such a way that it will alter the intended control flow of the product. Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInjection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-913\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This entry is frequently misused for vulnerabilities with a technical impact of \"code execution,\" which does not by itself indicate a root cause weakness, since dozens of weaknesses can enable code execution.\n**Comments:** This weakness only applies when the product's functionality intentionally constructs all or part of a code segment. It could be that executing code could be the result of other weaknesses that do not involve the construction of code segments.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n- Frequent Misinterpretation\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-29374:** Math component in an LLM framework translates user input into a Python expression that is input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n- **CVE-2024-5565:** Python-based library uses an LLM prompt containing user input to dynamically generate code that is then fed as input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n- **CVE-2024-4181:** Framework for LLM applications allows eval injection via a crafted response from a hosting provider.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nShell injection\nShell metacharacters\nOS Command Injection\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-88\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** The \"OS command injection\" phrase carries different meanings to different people. For some people, it only refers to cases in which the attacker injects command separators into arguments for an application-controlled program that is being invoked. For some people, it refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute OS commands of their own choosing. This usage could include untrusted search path weaknesses (CWE-426) that cause the application to find and execute an attacker-controlled program. Further complicating the issue is the case when argument injection (CWE-88) allows alternate command-line switches or options to be inserted into the command line, such as an \"-exec\" switch whose purpose may be to execute the subsequent argument as a command (this -exec switch exists in the UNIX \"find\" command, for example). In this latter case, however, CWE-88 could be regarded as the primary weakness in a chain with CWE-78.\n\n**[Research Gap]** More investigation is needed into the distinction between the OS command injection variants, including the role with argument injection (CWE-88). Equivalent distinctions may exist in other injection-related problems such as SQL injection.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-10987:** OS command injection in Wi-Fi router, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-10221:** Template functionality in network configuration management tool allows OS command injection, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-9054:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in username parameter, leading to OS command injection (CWE-78), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany web applications use template engines that allow developers to insert externally-influenced values into free text or messages in order to generate a full web page, document, message, etc. Such engines include Twig, Jinja2, Pug, Java Server Pages, FreeMarker, Velocity, ColdFusion, Smarty, and many others - including PHP itself. Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nServer-Side Template Injection / SSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a server.\nClient-Side Template Injection / CSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a client.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-94\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Since expression languages are often used in templating languages, there may be some overlap with CWE-917 (Expression Language Injection). XSS (CWE-79) is also co-located with template injection.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The interrelationships and differences between CWE-917 and CWE-1336 need to be further clarified.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-34359:** Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n- **CVE-2017-16783:** server-side template injection in content management server\n- **CVE-2020-9437:** authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction:** Compound\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a web server is designed to receive a request from a client without any mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it might be possible for an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSession Riding\nCross Site Reference Forgery\nXSRF\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nRequires -> CWE-346\nRequires -> CWE-441\nRequires -> CWE-642\nRequires -> CWE-613\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine if other weaknesses allow CSRF attacks to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable CSRF tokens might allow bypass of CSRF protection mechanisms; if this occurs, they might be better characterized as randomness/predictability weaknesses.\n**Reasons:**\n- Other\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThere can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.\n\n\n**[Theoretical]** \n\nThe CSRF topology is multi-channel:\n\n\n  - Attacker (as outsider) to intermediary (as user). The interaction point is either an external or internal channel.\n\n  - Intermediary (as user) to server (as victim). The activation point is an internal channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2004-1703:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag\n- **CVE-2004-1995:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag\n- **CVE-2004-1967:** Arbitrary code execution by specifying the code in a crafted img tag or URL\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDenylist / Deny List: This is used by CWE and CAPEC instead of other commonly-used terms. Its counterpart is allowlist.\nBlocklist / Block List: This is often used by security tools such as firewalls, email or web gateways, proxies, etc.\nBlacklist / Black List: This term is frequently used, but usage has been declining as organizations have started to adopt other terms.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\nChildOf -> CWE-1023\nCanPrecede -> CWE-79\nCanPrecede -> CWE-78\nCanPrecede -> CWE-434\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nMultiple interpretation errors can indirectly introduce inputs that should be disallowed. For example, a list of dangerous shell metacharacters might not include a metacharacter that only has meaning in one particular shell, not all of them; or a check for XSS manipulations might ignore an unusual construct that is supported by one web browser, but not others.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the \"\\\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.\n- **CVE-2008-2309:** product uses a denylist to identify potentially dangerous content, allowing attacker to bypass a warning\n- **CVE-2005-2782:** PHP remote file inclusion in web application that filters \"http\" and \"https\" URLs, but not \"ftp\".\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-138\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nMarshaling, Unmarshaling: Marshaling and unmarshaling are effectively synonyms for serialization and deserialization, respectively.\nPickling, Unpickling: In Python, the \"pickle\" functionality is used to perform serialization and deserialization.\nPHP Object Injection: Some PHP application researchers use this term when attacking unsafe use of the unserialize() function; but it is also used for CWE-915.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-913\nChildOf -> CWE-913\nPeerOf -> CWE-915\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between CWE-502 and CWE-915 need further exploration. CWE-915 is more narrowly scoped to object modification, and is not necessarily used for deserialization.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-12799:** chain: bypass of untrusted deserialization issue (CWE-502) by using an assumed-trusted class (CWE-183)\n- **CVE-2015-8103:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.\n- **CVE-2015-4852:** Deserialization issue in commonly-used Java library allows remote execution.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. \"eval\").\n\n### Extended Description\nThis may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, or at least modify what code can be executed.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-94\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Factors: special character errors can play a role in increasing the variety of code that can be injected, although some vulnerabilities do not require special characters at all, e.g. when a single function without arguments can be referenced and a terminator character is not necessary.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-4181:** Framework for LLM applications allows eval injection via a crafted response from a hosting provider.\n- **CVE-2022-2054:** Python compiler uses eval() to execute malicious strings as Python code.\n- **CVE-2021-22204:** Chain: regex in EXIF processor code does not correctly determine where a string ends (CWE-625), enabling eval injection (CWE-95), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n",
