CWE-174: Double Decoding of the Same Data (Score: 307.35)\n\nThe product decodes the same input twice, which can limit the effectiveness of any protection mechanism that occurs in between the decoding operations....\n\n### 2. CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (Score: 173.54)\n\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users....\n\n### 3. CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output (Score: 162.88)\n\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
