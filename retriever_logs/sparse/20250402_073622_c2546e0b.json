By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDirectory traversal\nPath traversal: \"Path traversal\" is preferred over \"directory traversal,\" but both terms are attack-focused.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.\n\n**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.\n\n**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing \"/\" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nLike other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use \"directory traversal\" only to refer to the injection of \"..\" and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.\n\n\nOther variants like \"absolute pathname\" and \"drive letter\" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve \"..\" or equivalent.\n\n\n**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nIncomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that \"..\\\" is vulnerable, but not test \"../\" which may also be vulnerable.\n\n\nAny combination of directory separators (\"/\", \"\\\", etc.) and numbers of \".\" (e.g. \"....\") can produce unique variants; for example, the \"//../\" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the \"\\\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nMemory Corruption: Often used to describe the consequences of writing to memory outside the bounds of a buffer, or to memory that is otherwise invalid.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.\n- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a default cryptographic key for potentially critical functionality.\n\n### Extended Description\nIt is common practice for products to be designed to use default keys. The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise. However, if admins do not change the defaults, it is easier for attackers to bypass authentication quickly across multiple organizations.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1392\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2018-3825:** cloud cluster management product has a default master encryption key\n- **CVE-2016-1561:** backup storage product has a default SSH public key in the authorized_keys file, allowing root access\n- **CVE-2010-2306:** Intrusion Detection System (IDS) uses the same static, private SSL keys for multiple devices and installations, allowing decryption of SSL traffic\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which \"permissions\" are not checked, which is an \"authorization\" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions for files under the \"Program Files\" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.\n- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nZip Slip: \"Zip slip\" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2019-20916:** Python package manager does not correctly restrict the filename specified in a Content-Disposition header, allowing arbitrary file read using path traversal sequences such as \"../\"\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-26: Path Traversal: '/dir/../filename'\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize \"/dir/../filename\" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n\nThe '/dir/../filename' manipulation is useful for bypassing some path traversal protection schemes. Sometimes a program only checks for \"../\" at the beginning of the input, so a \"/../\" can bypass that check.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-23\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product dereferences a pointer that contains a location for memory that was previously valid, but is no longer valid.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a product releases memory, but it maintains a pointer to that memory, then the memory might be re-allocated at a later time. If the original pointer is accessed to read or write data, then this could cause the product to read or modify data that is in use by a different function or process. Depending on how the newly-allocated memory is used, this could lead to a denial of service, information exposure, or code execution.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDangling pointer\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nCanPrecede -> CWE-125\nCanPrecede -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.\n\n**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of \"memory corruption\" or \"memory safety.\" As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2008-5013:** access of expired memory address leads to arbitrary code execution\n- **CVE-2010-3257:** stale pointer issue leads to denial of service and possibly other consequences\n- **CVE-2008-0062:** Chain: a message having an unknown message type may cause a reference to uninitialized memory resulting in a null pointer dereference (CWE-476) or dangling pointer (CWE-825), possibly crashing the system or causing heap corruption.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\n**Abstraction:** Compound\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files.\n\n### Extended Description\nA product that allows UNIX symbolic links (symlink) as part of paths whether in internal code or through user input can allow an attacker to spoof the symbolic link and traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files. The symbolic link can permit an attacker to read/write/corrupt a file that they originally did not have permissions to access.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSymlink following\nsymlink vulnerability\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-59\nRequires -> CWE-362\nRequires -> CWE-340\nRequires -> CWE-386\nRequires -> CWE-732\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine which weaknesses allow symlink following to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable file names might be intended functionality, but creation in a directory with insecure permissions might not.\n**Reasons:**\n- Other\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nSymlink vulnerabilities are regularly found in C and shell programs, but all programming languages can have this problem. Even shell programs are probably under-reported.\n\n\n\"Second-order symlink vulnerabilities\" may exist in programs that invoke other programs that follow symlinks. They are rarely reported but are likely to be fairly common when process invocation is used [REF-493].\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.\n- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.\n- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\ninsecure temporary file: Some people use the phrase \"insecure temporary file\" when referring to a link following weakness, but other weaknesses can produce insecure temporary files without any symlink involvement at all.\nZip Slip: \"Zip slip\" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Theoretical]** \n\nLink following vulnerabilities are Multi-factor Vulnerabilities (MFV). They are the combination of multiple elements: file or directory permissions, filename predictability, race conditions, and in some cases, a design limitation in which there is no mechanism for performing atomic file creation operations.\n\n\nSome potential factors are race conditions, permissions, and predictability.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.\n- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.\n- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nDuring installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-732\nChildOf -> CWE-732\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-1941:** Executables installed world-writable.\n- **CVE-2002-1713:** Home directories installed world-readable.\n- **CVE-2001-1550:** World-writable log files allow information loss; world-readable file has cleartext passwords.\n\n",

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.\n- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a default cryptographic key for potentially critical functionality.\n\n### Extended Description\nIt is common practice for products to be designed to use default keys. The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise. However, if admins do not change the defaults, it is easier for attackers to bypass authentication quickly across multiple organizations.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1392\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2018-3825:** cloud cluster management product has a default master encryption key\n- **CVE-2016-1561:** backup storage product has a default SSH public key in the authorized_keys file, allowing root access\n- **CVE-2010-2306:** Intrusion Detection System (IDS) uses the same static, private SSL keys for multiple devices and installations, allowing decryption of SSL traffic\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which \"permissions\" are not checked, which is an \"authorization\" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions for files under the \"Program Files\" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.\n- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nZip Slip: \"Zip slip\" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\nChildOf -> CWE-22\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2019-20916:** Python package manager does not correctly restrict the filename specified in a Content-Disposition header, allowing arbitrary file read using path traversal sequences such as \"../\"\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-26: Path Traversal: '/dir/../filename'\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize \"/dir/../filename\" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n\nThe '/dir/../filename' manipulation is useful for bypassing some path traversal protection schemes. Sometimes a program only checks for \"../\" at the beginning of the input, so a \"/../\" can bypass that check.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-23\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product dereferences a pointer that contains a location for memory that was previously valid, but is no longer valid.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a product releases memory, but it maintains a pointer to that memory, then the memory might be re-allocated at a later time. If the original pointer is accessed to read or write data, then this could cause the product to read or modify data that is in use by a different function or process. Depending on how the newly-allocated memory is used, this could lead to a denial of service, information exposure, or code execution.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDangling pointer\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nCanPrecede -> CWE-125\nCanPrecede -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.\n\n**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of \"memory corruption\" or \"memory safety.\" As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2008-5013:** access of expired memory address leads to arbitrary code execution\n- **CVE-2010-3257:** stale pointer issue leads to denial of service and possibly other consequences\n- **CVE-2008-0062:** Chain: a message having an unknown message type may cause a reference to uninitialized memory resulting in a null pointer dereference (CWE-476) or dangling pointer (CWE-825), possibly crashing the system or causing heap corruption.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\n**Abstraction:** Compound\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files.\n\n### Extended Description\nA product that allows UNIX symbolic links (symlink) as part of paths whether in internal code or through user input can allow an attacker to spoof the symbolic link and traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files. The symbolic link can permit an attacker to read/write/corrupt a file that they originally did not have permissions to access.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSymlink following\nsymlink vulnerability\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-59\nRequires -> CWE-362\nRequires -> CWE-340\nRequires -> CWE-386\nRequires -> CWE-732\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine which weaknesses allow symlink following to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable file names might be intended functionality, but creation in a directory with insecure permissions might not.\n**Reasons:**\n- Other\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nSymlink vulnerabilities are regularly found in C and shell programs, but all programming languages can have this problem. Even shell programs are probably under-reported.\n\n\n\"Second-order symlink vulnerabilities\" may exist in programs that invoke other programs that follow symlinks. They are rarely reported but are likely to be fairly common when process invocation is used [REF-493].\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.\n- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.\n- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\ninsecure temporary file: Some people use the phrase \"insecure temporary file\" when referring to a link following weakness, but other weaknesses can produce insecure temporary files without any symlink involvement at all.\nZip Slip: \"Zip slip\" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Theoretical]** \n\nLink following vulnerabilities are Multi-factor Vulnerabilities (MFV). They are the combination of multiple elements: file or directory permissions, filename predictability, race conditions, and in some cases, a design limitation in which there is no mechanism for performing atomic file creation operations.\n\n\nSome potential factors are race conditions, permissions, and predictability.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.\n- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.\n- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nDuring installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-732\nChildOf -> CWE-732\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-1941:** Executables installed world-writable.\n- **CVE-2002-1713:** Home directories installed world-readable.\n- **CVE-2001-1550:** World-writable log files allow information loss; world-readable file has cleartext passwords.\n\n"
