  "query": "## Vulnerability Description\nIn ORY Fosite (the security first OAuth2 & OpenID Connect framework for Go) before version 0.34.0, the `TokenRevocationHandler` **ignores errors coming from the storage**. This can lead to unexpected 200 status codes indicating successful revocation while the token is still valid. Whether an attacker can use this for her advantage depends on the ability to trigger errors in the store. This is fixed in version 0.34.0\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **ignores errors coming from the storage**\n- **impact:** unexpected 200 status codes indicating successful revocation while the token is still valid\n- **product:** ORY Fosite\n- **version:** before version 0.34.0\n- **component:** TokenRevocationHandler\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-15223:\n\n**1. Verification of CVE relation:**\n\n   - The provided GitHub security advisory directly mentions `CVE-2020-15223` as the CVE ID associated with the described vulnerability.\n   - The advisory title \"Token revokation incorrectly ignores storage errors\" aligns with the description of the vulnerability found in the code diffs.\n   - Therefore, the content is directly related to CVE-2020-15223.\n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n   - The `TokenRevocationHandler` in the `fosite` library was not properly handling errors returned by the storage layer during token revocation. Specifically, it was ignoring storage errors and returning a successful HTTP 200 status code even when the revocation had not actually succeeded.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n   - **Incorrect Error Handling:** The core issue is the lack of proper error checking in the `RevokeToken` function. If the underlying storage mechanism failed to revoke a token, the function was still returning a success response.\n   - **Violation of RFC 7009:**  RFC 7009 specifies that a 503 HTTP status code should be returned when the server encounters a problem during token revocation, which was not adhered to.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n   - **Token Persistence:** A successful exploitation could lead to a situation where tokens that should have been revoked remain valid, potentially allowing unauthorized access.\n    - **False Success:** Clients would receive a 200 OK response, incorrectly believing the token was invalidated.\n   - **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the application and the nature of the tokens, this could potentially lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized access to protected resources.\n   - **Abuse of Abandoned Tokens:** The advisory mentions that this behavior prevents a situation in which there is still a valid authorization grant for a particular client of which the end-user is not aware, which relates to the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors:**\n   - An attacker could potentially trigger errors in the storage layer during token revocation to keep tokens active, potentially by exploiting storage system failures, resource exhaustion, or by submitting many revocation requests to cause an overload, however the advisory states that the ability to trigger errors in the store is necessary for exploitation.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n    - **Ability to Revoke Tokens:** The attacker must have the ability to initiate token revocation requests, indicating they must be an authorized client.\n   - **Trigger Storage Errors:** The attacker needs to find a way to cause the storage layer to return errors when trying to revoke a token. The advisory notes that whether the attacker can exploit the vulnerability is dependent on their ability to cause these storage errors.\n\n**Additional Information from the Diff:**\n\n- The fix involves:\n    - Removing `fosite.ErrRevocationClientMismatch` which was not part of the RFC 6749 spec.\n    - Returning `fosite.ErrUnauthorizedClient` when the OAuth2 client doesn't match.\n    - Introducing `storeErrorsToRevocationError` which checks if either refresh or access token revocation has failed to return an appropriate error.\n    - The test cases now cover the storage error cases, ensuring that errors are properly handled.\n\nIn summary, CVE-2020-15223 highlights a flaw in the error handling logic of the token revocation process in the `fosite` library. This could allow malicious actors to keep tokens active despite attempted revocations, by triggering storage layer errors. The fix addresses the incorrect error handling and ensures that a 503 status code is returned when storage errors occur.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 754 | Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.641 |\n| 2 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.371 |\n| 3 | 287 | Improper Authentication | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.369 |\n| 4 | 617 | Reachable Assertion | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.366 |\n| 5 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.365 |\n| 6 | 299 | Improper Check for Certificate Revocation | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.436 |\n| 7 | 296 | Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.358 |\n| 9 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.356 |\n| 10 | 319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.355 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThe programmer may assume that certain events or conditions will never occur or do not need to be worried about, such as low memory conditions, lack of access to resources due to restrictive permissions, or misbehaving clients or components. However, attackers may intentionally trigger these unusual conditions, thus violating the programmer's assumptions, possibly introducing instability, incorrect behavior, or a vulnerability.\n\n\nNote that this entry is not exclusively about the use of exceptions and exception handling, which are mechanisms for both checking and handling unusual or unexpected conditions.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-703\nCanPrecede -> CWE-416\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Sometimes, when a return value can be used to indicate an error, an unchecked return value is a code-layer instance of a missing application-layer check for exceptional conditions. However, return values are not always needed to communicate exceptional conditions. For example, expiration of resources, values passed by reference, asynchronously modified data, sockets, etc. may indicate exceptional conditions without the use of a return value.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-49286:** Chain: function in web caching proxy does not correctly check a return value (CWE-253) leading to a reachable assertion (CWE-617)\n- **CVE-2007-3798:** Unchecked return value leads to resultant integer overflow and code execution.\n- **CVE-2006-4447:** Program does not check return value when invoking functions to drop privileges, which could leave users with higher privileges than expected by forcing those functions to fail.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community.

This is because the use of any revoked certificate is almost certainly malicious. The most common reason for certificate revocation is compromise of the system in question, with the result that no legitimate servers will be using a revoked certificate, unless they are sorely out of sync.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-295\nChildOf -> CWE-404\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2011-2014:** LDAP-over-SSL implementation does not check Certificate Revocation List (CRL), allowing spoofing using a revoked certificate.\n- **CVE-2011-0199:** Operating system does not check Certificate Revocation List (CRL) in some cases, allowing spoofing using a revoked certificate.\n- **CVE-2010-5185:** Antivirus product does not check whether certificates from signed executables have been revoked.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-296: Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not follow, or incorrectly follows, the chain of trust for a certificate back to a trusted root certificate, resulting in incorrect trust of any resource that is associated with that certificate.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIf a system does not follow the chain of trust of a certificate to a root server, the certificate loses all usefulness as a metric of trust. Essentially, the trust gained from a certificate is derived from a chain of trust -- with a reputable trusted entity at the end of that list. The end user must trust that reputable source, and this reputable source must vouch for the resource in question through the medium of the certificate.\n\n\nIn some cases, this trust traverses several entities who vouch for one another. The entity trusted by the end user is at one end of this trust chain, while the certificate-wielding resource is at the other end of the chain. If the user receives a certificate at the end of one of these trust chains and then proceeds to check only that the first link in the chain, no real trust has been derived, since the entire chain must be traversed back to a trusted source to verify the certificate.\n\n\nThere are several ways in which the chain of trust might be broken, including but not limited to:\n\n\n  - Any certificate in the chain is self-signed, unless it the root.\n\n  - Not every intermediate certificate is checked, starting from the original certificate all the way up to the root certificate.\n\n  - An intermediate, CA-signed certificate does not have the expected Basic Constraints or other important extensions.\n\n  - The root certificate has been compromised or authorized to the wrong party.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-295\nChildOf -> CWE-573\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.\n\n\nApplicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.\n\n\nWhen full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to \"sniff\" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-311\nChildOf -> CWE-311\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
