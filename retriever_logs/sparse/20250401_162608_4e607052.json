This could lead to remote information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation.Product AndroidVersions Android-9 Android-10 Android-11 Android-8.1Android ID A-182152757\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## WEAKNESS: 'heap buffer overflow'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 475.05)\n\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....\n\n### 2. CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound) (Score: 458.33)\n\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result....\n\n### 3. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 445.86)\n\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to st...\n\n### 4. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 433.89)\n\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....\n\n### 5. CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types (Score: 413.44)\n\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur....\n\n## WEAKNESS: 'out of bounds write'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.
