Furthermore, no **CSRF** check is in place as well, allowing such attack to be perform via **CSRF** against a logged in with such capability. In versions before 2.3.19, the lack of sanitisation and escaping in some of the fields, like the descritption could also lead to **Stored XSS** issues\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'improper access control'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
