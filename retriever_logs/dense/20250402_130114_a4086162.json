Specifically, users with the \"Contributor\" role, which has limited permissions, are able to clone and access draft and password-protected posts belonging to other users.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Broken Access Control:** The plugin fails to properly enforce access control restrictions, allowing lower-privileged users to access content they should not have permission to view.\n- **Unauthorized Post Access:**  Contributors can view content (drafts and password-protected posts) from other users.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can view the content of draft and password-protected posts belonging to other users which can contain sensitive data, intellectual property or other confidential content.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The vulnerability can be exploited by navigating to the \"All Posts\" section, locating the post intended for cloning, and utilizing the \"Click to Clone\" feature. The cloned post can then be edited to view its content.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with at least the \"Contributor\" role.\n- The attacker needs to be logged into the WordPress instance where the vulnerable plugin is active.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.078 |\n| 2 | 352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | Compound | Allowed | sparse | 0.073 |\n| 3 | 862 | Missing Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.069 |\n| 4 | 472 | External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.069 |\n| 5 | 266 | Incorrect Privilege Assignment | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.068 |\n| 6 | 425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.362 |\n| 7 | 471 | Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID) | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 285 | Improper Authorization | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.067 |\n| 9 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.066 |\n| 10 | 434 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.063 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction:** Compound\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a web server is designed to receive a request from a client without any mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it might be possible for an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSession Riding\nCross Site Reference Forgery\nXSRF\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nRequires -> CWE-346\nRequires -> CWE-441\nRequires -> CWE-642\nRequires -> CWE-613\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine if other weaknesses allow CSRF attacks to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable CSRF tokens might allow bypass of CSRF protection mechanisms; if this occurs, they might be better characterized as randomness/predictability weaknesses.\n**Reasons:**\n- Other\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThere can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.\n\n\n**[Theoretical]** \n\nThe CSRF topology is multi-channel:\n\n\n  - Attacker (as outsider) to intermediary (as user). The interaction point is either an external or internal channel.\n\n  - Intermediary (as user) to server (as victim). The activation point is an internal channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2004-1703:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag\n- **CVE-2004-1995:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag\n- **CVE-2004-1967:** Arbitrary code execution by specifying the code in a crafted img tag or URL\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n- **CVE-2009-3597:** Web application stores database file under the web root with insufficient access control (CWE-219), allowing direct request.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIf a web product does not properly protect assumed-immutable values from modification in hidden form fields, parameters, cookies, or URLs, this can lead to modification of critical data. Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAssumed-Immutable Parameter Tampering\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-471\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is a primary weakness for many other weaknesses and functional consequences, including XSS, SQL injection, path disclosure, and file inclusion.\n\n**[Theoretical]** This is a technology-specific MAID problem.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-0108:** Forum product allows spoofed messages of other users via hidden form fields for name and e-mail address.\n- **CVE-2000-0253:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n- **CVE-2000-0254:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-269\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-286\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1193:** untrusted user placed in unix \"wheel\" group\n- **CVE-2005-2741:** Product allows users to grant themselves certain rights that can be used to escalate privileges.\n- **CVE-2005-2496:** Product uses group ID of a user instead of the group, causing it to run with different privileges. This is resultant from some other unknown issue.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n### Extended Description\nWeb applications susceptible to direct request attacks often make the false assumption that such resources can only be reached through a given navigation path and so only apply authorization at certain points in the path.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nforced browsing: The \"forced browsing\" term could be misinterpreted to include weaknesses such as CSRF or XSS, so its use is discouraged.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-862\nChildOf -> CWE-862\nChildOf -> CWE-288\nChildOf -> CWE-424\nCanPrecede -> CWE-471\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Overlaps Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID), authorization errors, container errors; often primary to other weaknesses such as XSS and SQL injection.\n\n**[Theoretical]** \"Forced browsing\" is a step-based manipulation involving the omission of one or more steps, whose order is assumed to be immutable. The application does not verify that the first step was performed successfully before the second step. The consequence is typically \"authentication bypass\" or \"path disclosure,\" although it can be primary to all kinds of weaknesses, especially in languages such as PHP, which allow external modification of assumed-immutable variables.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29238:** Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.\n- **CVE-2022-23607:** Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that \"supercookies\" could be sent to any domain on redirect.\n- **CVE-2004-2144:** Bypass authentication via direct request.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly protect an assumed-immutable element from being modified by an attacker.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis occurs when a particular input is critical enough to the functioning of the application that it should not be modifiable at all, but it is. Certain resources are often assumed to be immutable when they are not, such as hidden form fields in web applications, cookies, and reverse DNS lookups.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** MAID issues can be primary to many other weaknesses, and they are a major factor in languages that provide easy access to internal program constructs, such as PHP's register_globals and similar features. However, MAID issues can also be resultant from weaknesses that modify internal state; for example, a program might validate some data and store it in memory, but a buffer overflow could overwrite that validated data, leading to a change in program logic.\n\n**[Theoretical]** There are many examples where the MUTABILITY property is a major factor in a vulnerability.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-1757:** Relies on $PHP_SELF variable for authentication.\n- **CVE-2005-1905:** Gain privileges by modifying assumed-immutable code addresses that are accessed by a driver.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\nWhen access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-209\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-202\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nUnrestricted File Upload: Used in vulnerability databases and elsewhere, but it is insufficiently precise. The phrase could be interpreted as the lack of restrictions on the size or number of uploaded files, which is a resource consumption issue.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-669\nChildOf -> CWE-669\nPeerOf -> CWE-351\nPeerOf -> CWE-436\nPeerOf -> CWE-430\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThis can have a chaining relationship with incomplete denylist / permissive allowlist errors when the product tries, but fails, to properly limit which types of files are allowed (CWE-183, CWE-184).\n\n\nThis can also overlap multiple interpretation errors for intermediaries, e.g. anti-virus products that do not remove or quarantine attachments with certain file extensions that can be processed by client systems.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-5227:** PHP-based FAQ management app does not check the MIME type for uploaded images\n- **CVE-2001-0901:** Web-based mail product stores \".shtml\" attachments that could contain SSI\n- **CVE-2002-1841:** PHP upload does not restrict file types\n\n",
