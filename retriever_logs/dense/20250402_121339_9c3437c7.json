This situation (together with the **weak password policy** that forces a 4-digit password) allows remote attackers to easily obtain administrative access via brute-force attacks.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'weak password policy'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
