  "query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    Multiple exploitable **integer overflow** vulnerabilities exist within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. A specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an **integer overflow** due to **unchecked arithmetic** resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## WEAKNESS: 'integer overflow'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 768.31)\n\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to st...\n\n### 2. CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error (Score: 683.73)\n\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion....\n\n### 3.
