A specially crafted malformed file can lead to an **out-of-bounds read** and type confusion, which could lead to code execution. An attacker can provide malicious input to trigger any of these vulnerabilities. An oob read vulnerability exists in Nef_S2/SNC_io_parser.h SNC_io_parserread_sedge() seh->source().\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **weakness:** **out-of-bounds read**\n- **impact:** code execution\n- **product:** CGAL libcgal\n- **version:** CGAL-5.1.1\n- **component:** Nef polygon-parsing functionality\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe root cause is a lack of bounds checking in the CGAL library's Nef polygon parsing code. Specifically, when parsing a `.nef3` file, the code reads integer indexes from the file and uses them to access vectors storing various object handles (e.g., vertices, edges, faces). There are no checks to validate if these indexes are within the bounds of the corresponding vectors before dereferencing, which can lead to out-of-bounds reads.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n- **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to the lack of index validation when accessing vectors. Specifically, the code reads an index value from the input file, and without checking if this value is within the allocated size of the vector, it directly accesses the vector via this index. This is observed in various functions like `read_vertex`, `read_edge`, `read_facet`, etc.\n- **Type Confusion:** By writing an out of bounds memory address, it's possible to cause type confusion, as the code could interpret arbitrary memory as an object of an unexpected type which, when dereferenced later on, can lead to arbitrary code execution.\n- **Lack of Input Validation:** The parsing code directly uses the provided indexes from the input file without any validation, making it vulnerable to malicious input.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Code Execution:** The primary impact is the potential for arbitrary code execution. By controlling the indexes read from the file, an attacker can force the program to read from arbitrary memory locations. This can lead to unexpected program behavior, including crashes or the ability to overwrite critical parts of memory which could eventually lead to code execution.\n- **Denial of Service:** The out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities can lead to crashes, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Malicious Input File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted `.nef3` file or similar format that contains manipulated indexes designed to cause out-of-bounds accesses.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Ability to Provide Input:** An attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted input file to an application or service that uses the vulnerable CGAL library to parse Nef polygons. This could involve sending the file over a network, uploading it to a web service, or having a local application open the malicious file.\n\n**CVE IDs:**\n\nThe report lists the following CVEs as being related to this vulnerability:\n\n- CVE-2020-28601, CVE-2020-28602, CVE-2020-28603, CVE-2020-28604, CVE-2020-28605, CVE-2020-28606, CVE-2020-28607, CVE-2020-28608, CVE-2020-28609, CVE-2020-28610, CVE-2020-28611, CVE-2020-28612, CVE-2020-28613, CVE-2020-28614, CVE-2020-28615, CVE-2020-28616, CVE-2020-28617, CVE-2020-28618, CVE-2020-28619, CVE-2020-28620, CVE-2020-28621, CVE-2020-28622, CVE-2020-28623, CVE-2020-28624, CVE-2020-28625, CVE-2020-28626, CVE-2020-28627, CVE-2020-28628, CVE-2020-28629, CVE-2020-28630, CVE-2020-28631, CVE-2020-28632, CVE-2020-28633, CVE-2020-28634, CVE-2020-28635, CVE-2020-28636, CVE-2020-35628, CVE-2020-35629, CVE-2020-35630, CVE-2020-35631, CVE-2020-35632, CVE-2020-35633, CVE-2020-35634, CVE-2020-35635, CVE-2020-35636.\n\n**CVE-2020-28631 Specifics:**\n\nSpecifically, the content identifies CVE-2020-28631 as an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the `Nef_S2/SNC_io_parser.h` file, within the `SNC_io_parser::read_sedge()` function, specifically when handling the `seh->source()` member. This is where an attacker-controlled index is used to dereference the `Edge_of` vector, causing a potential out of bounds read and type confusion.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The Talos report provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerable code patterns and the structure of the `.nef3` input file.\n- The Gentoo and Debian advisories confirm the widespread nature of the vulnerability and its potential for code execution.\n- The vulnerability is present in versions prior to CGAL 5.4.1.\n- The provided information offers more detail than a typical CVE description.\n\nIn summary, CVE-2020-28631 is one of many related vulnerabilities caused by improper index validation in the CGAL library's Nef polygon parsing code which allows for out-of-bounds reads, type confusion and potentially arbitrary code execution via a specially crafted input file.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 129 | Improper Validation of Array Index | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.830 |\n| 2 | 125 | Out-of-bounds Read | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.535 |\n| 3 | 190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.380 |\n| 4 | 1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.361 |\n| 5 | 193 | Off-by-one Error | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.357 |\n| 6 | 476 | NULL Pointer Dereference | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.564 |\n| 7 | 128 | Wrap-around Error | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 787 | Out-of-bounds Write | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.357 |\n| 9 | 197 | Numeric Truncation Error | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.355 |\n| 10 | 122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.354 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nout-of-bounds array index\nindex-out-of-range\narray index underflow\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1285\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-823\nCanPrecede -> CWE-789\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

See Terminology Notes.\nwrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of \"wraparound\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with \"overflow,\" \"underflow,\" and \"wraparound\" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called \"underflows\").\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\n\"Integer overflow\" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.\n\n\nA \"wraparound\" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.\n\n\n\"Overflow\" is sometimes conflated with \"wraparound\" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.\n\n\nThe \"overflow\" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use \"overflow\" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using \"underflow\" for exceeding the minimum.\n\n\nSome people use \"overflow\" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses \"underflow\" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.\n\n\nSee [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.\n\n\n**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSpecified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-789\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This value may be required as an index into a buffer, a loop iterator, or simply necessary state data. In any case, the value cannot be trusted and the system will be in an undefined state. While this method may be employed viably to isolate the low bits of a value, this usage is rare, and truncation usually implies that an implementation error has occurred.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-681\nChildOf -> CWE-681\nChildOf -> CWE-681\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-195\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-196\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-192\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-194\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
