This process of including sensitive data in transit creates an exploitable condition.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n-   **Information Leakage:** Sensitive data is being included in the outbound data stream, making it vulnerable to interception.\n-   **Insertion of Sensitive Information:** The core issue lies in how `synorelayd` processes and includes sensitive data when handling QuickConnect connections. This allows attackers to inject commands by manipulating this information.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n-   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful attack can allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM).\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n-   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** The attacker needs to intercept network traffic between the client and the Synology server to exploit this vulnerability.\n-   **QuickConnect Traffic:** The attack is specifically related to inbound traffic coming from QuickConnect connections.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n-   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be in a position to perform a MitM attack, meaning they need to be able to intercept network traffic between the client (user) and the Synology QuickConnect server.\n-   **Knowledge of QuickConnect:** An attacker needs to be aware of how QuickConnect is used to redirect traffic and how the system interacts with QuickConnect to leverage the insertion of sensitive data.\n-   **Targeted User Interaction:** The victim needs to use the QuickConnect service, thus generating the vulnerable traffic for the attacker to exploit.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability is located in the `synorelayd` component of the Synology DSM.\n- The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS v3 score of 8.3, which indicates a high severity.\n- The vulnerability is fixed in DSM version 6.2.3-25426-3 and later.\n- This vulnerability, when exploited together with TALOS-2020-1059 (likely related to HTTP redirection to unencrypted channel), could allow an attacker to get a valid cookie, which enhances the exploitability of CVE-2021-26566.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.221 |\n| 2 | 74 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection') | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.197 |\n| 3 | 319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.189 |\n| 4 | 89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.182 |\n| 5 | 321 | Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.171 |\n| 6 | 78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.582 |\n| 7 | 79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 538 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.169 |\n| 9 | 215 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Debugging Code | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.167 |\n| 10 | 259 | Use of Hard-coded Password | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.166 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-209\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-202\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n**Comments:** Examine the children and descendants of this entry to find a more precise mapping.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Theoretical]** Many people treat injection only as an input validation problem (CWE-20) because many people do not distinguish between the consequence/attack (injection) and the protection mechanism that prevents the attack from succeeding. However, input validation is only one potential protection mechanism (output encoding is another), and there is a chaining relationship between improper input validation and the improper enforcement of the structure of messages to other components. Other issues not directly related to input validation, such as race conditions, could similarly impact message structure.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-5184:** API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n- **CVE-2022-36069:** Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n- **CVE-1999-0067:** Canonical example of OS command injection. CGI program does not neutralize \"|\" metacharacter when invoking a phonebook program.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany communication channels can be \"sniffed\" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.\n\n\nApplicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.\n\n\nWhen full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to \"sniff\" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-311\nChildOf -> CWE-311\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29519:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends sensitive information in plaintext, including passwords and session tokens.\n- **CVE-2022-30312:** Building Controller uses a protocol that transmits authentication credentials in plaintext.\n- **CVE-2022-31204:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends password in plaintext.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSQL injection: a common attack-oriented phrase\nSQLi: a common abbreviation for \"SQL injection\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-943\nChildOf -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

It can be primary to authentication errors.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-32530:** SQL injection in security product dashboard using crafted certificate fields\n- **CVE-2021-42258:** SQL injection in time and billing software, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-27101:** SQL injection in file-transfer system via a crafted Host header, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation\n- **CVE-2022-30271:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used by default.\n- **CVE-2020-10884:** WiFi router service has a hard-coded encryption key, allowing root access\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nShell injection\nShell metacharacters\nOS Command Injection\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-88\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** The \"OS command injection\" phrase carries different meanings to different people. For some people, it only refers to cases in which the attacker injects command separators into arguments for an application-controlled program that is being invoked. For some people, it refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute OS commands of their own choosing. This usage could include untrusted search path weaknesses (CWE-426) that cause the application to find and execute an attacker-controlled program. Further complicating the issue is the case when argument injection (CWE-88) allows alternate command-line switches or options to be inserted into the command line, such as an \"-exec\" switch whose purpose may be to execute the subsequent argument as a command (this -exec switch exists in the UNIX \"find\" command, for example). In this latter case, however, CWE-88 could be regarded as the primary weakness in a chain with CWE-78.\n\n**[Research Gap]** More investigation is needed into the distinction between the OS command injection variants, including the role with argument injection (CWE-88). Equivalent distinctions may exist in other injection-related problems such as SQL injection.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-10987:** OS command injection in Wi-Fi router, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-10221:** Template functionality in network configuration management tool allows OS command injection, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-9054:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in username parameter, leading to OS command injection (CWE-78), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nXSS: A common abbreviation for Cross-Site Scripting.\nHTML Injection: Used as a synonym of stored (Type 2) XSS.\nCSS: In the early years after initial discovery of XSS, \"CSS\" was a commonly-used acronym. However, this would cause confusion with \"Cascading Style Sheets,\" so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nCanPrecede -> CWE-494\nPeerOf -> CWE-352\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThere can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.\n\n\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nXSS flaws are very common in web applications, since they require a great deal of developer discipline to avoid them.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-25926:** Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.\n- **CVE-2021-25963:** Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n- **CVE-2021-1879:** Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nPeerOf -> CWE-321\nPeerOf -> CWE-257\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

These variants are likely to have different consequences, detectability, etc. More importantly, from a vulnerability theory perspective, they could be characterized as different behaviors.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29964:** Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access\n- **CVE-2021-37555:** Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]\n- **CVE-2021-35033:** Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\n",
