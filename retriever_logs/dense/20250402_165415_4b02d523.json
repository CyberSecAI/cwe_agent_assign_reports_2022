Attackers can bypass device identity authentication by constructing malicious data packets.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **weakness:** **authentication bypass**\n- **impact:** bypass device identity authentication\n- **vector:** constructing malicious data packets\n- **attacker:** attackers\n- **product:** Dahua products\n\n### CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\n### Primary CWE Match\nCWE-287\n\n#### Top CWEs\n- CWE-287 (Count: 6)\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-33044:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause lies in the improper handling of the \"clientType\" parameter during the \"global.login\" sequence in Dahua devices. Specifically, setting the \"clientType\" to \"NetKeyboard\" bypasses authentication.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the normal authentication mechanism by manipulating the `clientType` parameter in the login request. The system incorrectly accepts the \"NetKeyboard\" client type, even when the device doesn't support this functionality.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Dahua device.\n*   **Full Control:** Once authenticated (or bypassed), an attacker can potentially gain complete control of the device, depending on the privileges associated with the default admin account.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Remote Access:** The attack vector is remote, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network.\n*   **Protocol:** The vulnerability is present in the DHIP and HTTP/HTTPS protocols used by Dahua devices.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network or have network access to the vulnerable Dahua device.\n*   **No Credentials Needed:** The attacker does not need valid login credentials to exploit this specific vulnerability. The authentication bypass allows the attacker to effectively circumvent the need for credentials.\n\n**Technical Details:**\nThe vulnerability is triggered by sending a \"global.login\" request with the \"clientType\" parameter set to \"NetKeyboard\". This is unexpected behavior, as devices not supporting this functionality should not allow authentication bypass.\n\nExample of a vulnerable login request:\n```json\n{\n    \"method\": \"global.login\",\n    \"params\":\n    {\n        \"userName\": \"admin\",\n        \"loginType\": \"Direct\",\n        \"clientType\": \"NetKeyboard\",\n        \"authorityType\": \"Default\",\n        \"passwordType\": \"Default\",\n        \"password\": \"Not Used\"\n    },\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"session\": 0\n}\n```\n\n**Affected Devices:**\n* IPC/VTH/VTO devices with firmware older than June 2021 that do not support \"NetKeyboard\" functionality are affected.\n\nThis content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including the specific parameters needed to exploit the vulnerability and the vulnerable device types.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 288 | Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.187 |\n| 2 | 287 | Improper Authentication | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.145 |\n| 3 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.142 |\n| 4 | 290 | Authentication Bypass by Spoofing | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.141 |\n| 5 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.140 |\n| 6 | 289 | Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.582 |\n| 7 | 178 | Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 302 | Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.129 |\n| 9 | 304 | Missing Critical Step in Authentication | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.127 |\n| 10 | 303 | Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.124 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-306\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nPeerOf -> CWE-420\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** overlaps Unprotected Alternate Channel\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-1179:** Router allows remote attackers to read system logs without authentication by directly connecting to the login screen and typing certain control characters.\n- **CVE-1999-1454:** Attackers with physical access to the machine may bypass the password prompt by pressing the ESC (Escape) key.\n- **CVE-1999-1077:** OS allows local attackers to bypass the password protection of idled sessions via the programmer's switch or CMD-PWR keyboard sequence, which brings up a debugger that the attacker can use to disable the lock.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nWhen an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nauthentification: An alternate term is \"authentification\", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.\nAuthN: \"AuthN\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authentication\" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from \"AuthZ,\" which is an abbreviation of \"authorization.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\nAuthC: \"AuthC\" is used as an abbreviation of \"authentication,\" but it appears to used less frequently than \"AuthN.\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
