This can allow untrusted applications to obtain sensitive data. There are two variations on the standard broadcast intent, ordered and sticky.\n\n\nOrdered broadcast intents are delivered to a series of registered receivers in order of priority as declared by the Receivers. A malicious receiver can give itself a high priority and cause a denial of service by stopping the broadcast from propagating further down the chain. There is also the possibility of malicious data modification, as a receiver may also alter the data within the Intent before passing it on to the next receiver. The downstream components have no way of asserting that the data has not been altered earlier in the chain.\n\n\nSticky broadcast intents remain accessible after the initial broadcast. An old sticky intent will be broadcast again to any new receivers that register for it in the future, greatly increasing the chances of information exposure over time. Also, sticky broadcasts cannot be protected by permissions that may apply to other kinds of intents.\n\n\nIn addition, any broadcast intent may include a URI that references data that the receiving component does not normally have the privileges to access. The sender of the intent can include special privileges that grant the receiver read or write access to the specific URI included in the intent. A malicious receiver that intercepts this intent will also gain those privileges and be able to read or write the resource at the specified URI.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-4903:** An Android application does not use FLAG_IMMUTABLE when creating a PendingIntent.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-925: Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe Android application uses a Broadcast Receiver that receives an Intent but does not properly verify that the Intent came from an authorized source.\n\n### Extended Description\nCertain types of Intents, identified by action string, can only be broadcast by the operating system itself, not by third-party applications. However, when an application registers to receive these implicit system intents, it is also registered to receive any explicit intents. While a malicious application cannot send an implicit system intent, it can send an explicit intent to the target application, which may assume that any received intent is a valid implicit system intent and not an explicit intent from another application. This may lead to unintended behavior.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nIntent Spoofing\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-940\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry will be made more comprehensive in later CWE versions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-926: Improper Export of Android Application Components\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe Android application exports a component for use by other applications, but does not properly restrict which applications can launch the component or access the data it contains.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThe attacks and consequences of improperly exporting a component may depend on the exported component:\n\n\n  - If access to an exported Activity is not restricted, any application will be able to launch the activity. This may allow a malicious application to gain access to sensitive information, modify the internal state of the application, or trick a user into interacting with the victim application while believing they are still interacting with the malicious application.\n\n  - If access to an exported Service is not restricted, any application may start and bind to the Service. Depending on the exposed functionality, this may allow a malicious application to perform unauthorized actions, gain access to sensitive information, or corrupt the internal state of the application.\n\n  - If access to a Content Provider is not restricted to only the expected applications, then malicious applications might be able to access the sensitive data. Note that in Android before 4.2, the Content Provider is automatically exported unless it has been explicitly declared as NOT exported.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen a product allows a user's input to contain code syntax, it might be possible for an attacker to craft the code in such a way that it will alter the intended control flow of the product. Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInjection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-913\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This entry is frequently misused for vulnerabilities with a technical impact of \"code execution,\" which does not by itself indicate a root cause weakness, since dozens of weaknesses can enable code execution.\n**Comments:** This weakness only applies when the product's functionality intentionally constructs all or part of a code segment. It could be that executing code could be the result of other weaknesses that do not involve the construction of code segments.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n- Frequent Misinterpretation\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-29374:** Math component in an LLM framework translates user input into a Python expression that is input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n- **CVE-2024-5565:** Python-based library uses an LLM prompt containing user input to dynamically generate code that is then fed as input into the Python exec() method, allowing code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n- **CVE-2024-4181:** Framework for LLM applications allows eval injection via a crafted response from a hosting provider.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which \"permissions\" are not checked, which is an \"authorization\" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].\n**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure \"Everyone: Full Control\" permissions for files under the \"Program Files\" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.\n- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1427: Improper Neutralization of Input Used for LLM Prompting\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses externally-provided data to build prompts provided to\nlarge language models (LLMs), but the way these prompts are constructed\ncauses the LLM to fail to distinguish between user-supplied inputs and\ndeveloper provided system directives.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\n When prompts are constructed using externally controllable data, it is often possible to cause an LLM to ignore the original guidance provided by its creators (known as the \"system prompt\") by inserting malicious instructions in plain human language or using bypasses such as special characters or tags. Because LLMs are designed to treat all instructions as legitimate, there is often no way for the model to differentiate between what prompt language is malicious when it performs inference and returns data. Many LLM systems incorporate data from other adjacent products or external data sources like Wikipedia using API calls and retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Any external sources in use that may contain untrusted data should also be considered potentially malicious. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nprompt injection: attack-oriented term for modifying prompts, whether due to this weakness or other weaknesses\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Ensure that the weakness being identified involves improper neutralization during prompt generation. A different CWE might be needed if the core concern is related to inadvertent insertion of sensitive information, generating prompts from third-party sources that should not have been trusted (as may occur with indirect prompt injection), or jailbreaking, then the root cause might be a different weakness.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-32786:** Chain: LLM integration framework has prompt injection (CWE-1427) that allows an attacker to force the service to retrieve data from an arbitrary URL, essentially providing SSRF (CWE-918) and potentially injecting content into downstream tasks.\n- **CVE-2024-5184:** ML-based email analysis product uses an API service that allows a malicious user to inject a direct prompt and take over the service logic, forcing it to leak the standard hard-coded system prompts and/or execute unwanted prompts to leak sensitive data.\n- **CVE-2024-5565:** Chain: library for generating SQL via LLMs using RAG uses a prompt function to present the user with visualized results, allowing altering of the prompt using prompt injection (CWE-1427) to run arbitrary Python code (CWE-94) instead of the intended visualization code.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe PHP application receives input from an upstream component, but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the input before its usage in \"require,\" \"include,\" or similar functions.\n\n### Extended Description\nIn certain versions and configurations of PHP, this can allow an attacker to specify a URL to a remote location from which the product will obtain the code to execute. In other cases in association with path traversal, the attacker can specify a local file that may contain executable statements that can be parsed by PHP.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nRemote file include\nRFI: The Remote File Inclusion (RFI) acronym is often used by vulnerability researchers.\nLocal file inclusion: This term is frequently used in cases in which remote download is disabled, or when the first part of the filename is not under the attacker's control, which forces use of relative path traversal (CWE-23) attack techniques to access files that may contain previously-injected PHP code, such as web access logs.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-829\nCanPrecede -> CWE-94\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-426\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThis is frequently a functional consequence of other weaknesses. It is usually multi-factor with other factors (e.g. MAID), although not all inclusion bugs involve assumed-immutable data. Direct request weaknesses frequently play a role.\n\n\nCan overlap directory traversal in local inclusion problems.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2004-0285:** Modification of assumed-immutable configuration variable in include file allows file inclusion via direct request.\n- **CVE-2004-0030:** Modification of assumed-immutable configuration variable in include file allows file inclusion via direct request.\n- **CVE-2004-0068:** Modification of assumed-immutable configuration variable in include file allows file inclusion via direct request.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-284: Improper Access Control\n**Abstraction:** Pillar\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAccess control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:\n\n\n  - Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)\n\n  - Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and\n\n  - Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)\n\nWhen any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.\n\nThere are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:\n\n\n  - Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.\n\n  - Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthorization: The terms \"access control\" and \"authorization\" are often used interchangeably, although many people have distinct definitions. The CWE usage of \"access control\" is intended as a general term for the various mechanisms that restrict which users can access which resources, and \"authorization\" is more narrowly defined. It is unlikely that there will be community consensus on the use of these terms.\n\n### Relationships\nNone\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-284 is extremely high-level, a Pillar. Its name, \"Improper Access Control,\" is often misused in low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287] or by active use of the OWASP Top Ten, such as \"A01:2021-Broken Access Control\". It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** Consider using descendants of CWE-284 that are more specific to the kind of access control involved, such as those involving authorization (Missing Authorization (CWE-862), Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863), Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732), etc.); authentication (Missing Authentication (CWE-306) or Weak Authentication (CWE-1390)); Incorrect User Management (CWE-286); Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints (CWE-923); etc.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n- Abstraction\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication\n- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n- CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** \n\nThis entry needs more work. Possible sub-categories include:\n\n\n  - Trusted group includes undesired entities (partially covered by CWE-286)\n\n  - Group can perform undesired actions\n\n  - ACL parse error does not fail closed\n\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24985:** A form hosting website only checks the session authentication status for a single form, making it possible to bypass authentication when there are multiple forms\n- **CVE-2022-29238:** Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.\n- **CVE-2022-23607:** Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that \"supercookies\" could be sent to any domain on redirect\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nWhen an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nauthentification: An alternate term is \"authentification\", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.\nAuthN: \"AuthN\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authentication\" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from \"AuthZ,\" which is an abbreviation of \"authorization.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\nAuthC: \"AuthC\" is used as an abbreviation of \"authentication,\" but it appears to used less frequently than \"AuthN.\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAlthough this weakness can occur with any type of resource, it is frequently introduced when a product uses a directory search path to find executables or code libraries, but the path contains a directory that can be modified by an attacker, such as \"/tmp\" or the current working directory.\n\n\nIn Windows-based systems, when the LoadLibrary or LoadLibraryEx function is called with a DLL name that does not contain a fully qualified path, the function follows a search order that includes two path elements that might be uncontrolled:\n\n\n  - the directory from which the program has been loaded\n\n  - the current working directory\n\nIn some cases, the attack can be conducted remotely, such as when SMB or WebDAV network shares are used.\n\nOne or more locations in that path could include the Windows drive root or its subdirectories. This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory. In Windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled.\n\n\nIn some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element.\n\n\nIn software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository. This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDLL preloading: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.\nBinary planting: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.\nInsecure library loading: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.\nDependency confusion: As of February 2021, this term is used to describe CWE-427 in the context of managing installation of software package dependencies, in which attackers release packages on public sites where the names are the same as package names used by private repositories, and the search for the dependent package tries the public site first, downloading untrusted code. It may also be referred to as a \"substitution attack.\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-668\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Unlike untrusted search path (CWE-426), which inherently involves control over the definition of a control sphere (i.e., modification of a search path), this entry concerns a fixed control sphere in which some part of the sphere may be under attacker control (i.e., the search path cannot be modified by an attacker, but one element of the path can be under attacker control).\n\n**[Theoretical]** This weakness is not a clean fit under CWE-668 or CWE-610, which suggests that the control sphere model might need enhancement or clarification.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-25815:** chain: a change in an underlying package causes the gettext function to use implicit initialization with a hard-coded path (CWE-1419) under the user-writable C:\\ drive, introducing an untrusted search path element (CWE-427) that enables spoofing of messages.\n- **CVE-2022-4826:** Go-based git extension on Windows can search for and execute a malicious \"..exe\" in a repository because Go searches the current working directory if git.exe is not found in the PATH\n- **CVE-2020-26284:** A Static Site Generator built in Go, when running on Windows, searches the current working directory for a command, possibly allowing code execution using a malicious .exe or .bat file with the name being searched\n\n",
