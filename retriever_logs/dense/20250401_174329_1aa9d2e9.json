When a user is blocked after submitting a replace job, the job is still run, even if it may be run at a later time (due to the job queue backlog)\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **incorrect access control**\n- **impact:** blocked job is still run\n- **attacker:** user\n- **product:** ReplaceText extension\n- **version:** through 1.41\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41801:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe `ReplaceText` MediaWiki extension was not properly checking user permissions before executing text replacement jobs. This allowed a user who had their permissions revoked (e.g., by being blocked) to continue performing text replacement actions that they were no longer authorized to perform.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The `ReplaceTextJob` class lacked a check to ensure that the user still possessed the `replacetext` permission right at the time of job execution. It relied on the initial permission check at the time the job was created/queued, which could become invalid if user permissions changed after the job was queued and before it ran.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n*   **Unauthorized Actions:** A blocked user or a user who had their permissions revoked could continue to modify pages using the `ReplaceText` extension, potentially causing vandalism or other unwanted changes even after administrative intervention.\n*   **Circumvention of Administrative Controls:** Blocking a user or removing permissions would not immediately prevent them from performing text replacements if jobs were already queued.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n*   An attacker would need to use the `ReplaceText` extension to queue jobs, then get their permissions revoked by being blocked, or have their user rights removed. Jobs submitted before permissions revocation would still execute.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   The attacker needs a user account that initially has the `replacetext` permission right.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to submit text replacement jobs through the `ReplaceText` special page or an API.\n\n**Additional details:**\n*   The vulnerability was addressed by adding a permission check within the `ReplaceTextJob::run` method. This check uses `PermissionManager->userCan` to verify that the user still has the necessary `replacetext` right.\n*   The fix ensures that if the user no longer has permission (due to being blocked or rights revocation), the job will not proceed. It uses the correct `userCan` method to properly detect a blocked user.\n*   The fix involved modifying the return value of the function to prevent the job from being retried when it fails due to permission issues.\n*   The fix was backported to multiple branches of the MediaWiki software: REL1_31, REL1_35, REL1_36, REL1_37 and master.\n*  A bug was found in the initial fix for MediaWiki 1.35 which was missing a `use` statement and was fixed.\n* The patch would only stop users who were blocked between the job being submitted, and the job being run.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.255 |\n| 2 | 367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.248 |\n| 3 | 522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.247 |\n| 4 | 256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.245 |\n| 5 | 266 | Incorrect Privilege Assignment | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.240 |\n| 6 | 449 | The UI Performs the Wrong Action | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.437 |\n| 7 | 609 | Double-Checked Locking | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.231 |\n| 9 | 532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.231 |\n| 10 | 613 | Insufficient Session Expiration | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.230 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community.

This should not be done, as it is not guaranteed to work in all languages and on all architectures.

For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.\n\n\n\n",

This is resultant from some other unknown issue.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-449: The UI Performs the Wrong Action\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe UI performs the wrong action with respect to the user's request.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-446\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This should not be done, as it is not guaranteed to work in all languages and on all architectures. In summary, other threads may not be operating inside the synchronous block and are not guaranteed to see the operations execute in the same order as they would appear inside the synchronous block.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-667\nCanPrecede -> CWE-367\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2017-9615:** verbose logging stores admin credentials in a world-readable log file\n- **CVE-2018-1999036:** SSH password for private key stored in build log\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nAccording to WASC, \"Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.\"\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nCanPrecede -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.\n\n\n\n"
