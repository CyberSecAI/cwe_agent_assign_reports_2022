There are unconditional implementations of Send and Sync for Bunch.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **impact:** unconditional implementations of Send and Sync\n- **product:** bunch crate\n- **version:** through 2020-11-12\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n- The `bunch` crate unconditionally implements `Send` and `Sync` traits for its `Bunch<T>` struct, without requiring `T` to also implement these traits. This is unsound because it allows users to insert non-thread-safe types into `Bunch<T>` and then access them from multiple threads, which leads to data races.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n- **Unconditional `Send`/`Sync` Implementation:** The core issue is the unsafe implementation of `Send` and `Sync` for `Bunch<T>`.  These traits are markers for types that can be safely moved between threads (`Send`) and accessed from multiple threads concurrently (`Sync`). Incorrectly implementing them allows for unsafe concurrent access.\n- **Data Races:** By inserting types that are not `Sync` (like `Cell<T>`, `Rc<T>`), it's possible to create data races when accessing the data through `Bunch::get()` from different threads.\n- **Violation of Rust's Safety Guarantees:** This bypasses Rust's safety mechanisms, which rely on the `Send` and `Sync` traits to prevent data races.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Memory Corruption:** The data races can lead to undefined behavior and ultimately, memory corruption. As demonstrated in the provided proof of concept, this can result in segmentation faults.\n- **Undefined Behavior:** The vulnerability can cause unpredictable and potentially exploitable behavior due to memory corruption resulting from data races.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Network:** The CVSS vector indicates a network attack vector, which is likely because a program using the vulnerable crate might be part of a network service. However the vulnerability itself is in the crate's implementation, not a network protocol.\n- **Multithreaded Applications:** The attack relies on exploiting the vulnerability within a multithreaded program.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Ability to use the `bunch` crate:** The attacker needs to be able to include and use the affected crate in a project.\n- **Ability to create multithreaded applications:** The attacker needs to structure their application to use multiple threads to trigger the data races.\n- **No special privileges:** The attacker doesn't require any special privileges.\n- **No user interaction:** Exploitation does not require user interaction.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n- The provided code example demonstrates how to create a data race using `Cell<T>`, which is not `Sync`.\n- The fix is to add a `T: Sync` bound to the `unsafe impl<T> Sync for Bunch<T> {}`, which would prevent non-thread-safe types from being stored in `Bunch<T>` when multithreaded access is desired.\n\n**In summary, the `bunch` crate incorrectly implements `Send` and `Sync` traits, leading to data races and memory corruption when used in multithreaded applications, allowing for arbitrary code execution.**\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 366 | Race Condition within a Thread | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.105 |\n| 2 | 362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.061 |\n| 3 | 908 | Use of Uninitialized Resource | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.059 |\n| 4 | 93 | Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.045 |\n| 5 | 909 | Missing Initialization of Resource | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.045 |\n| 6 | 1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.423 |\n| 7 | 117 | Improper Output Neutralization for Logs | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 789 | Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.044 |\n| 9 | 191 | Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound) | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.044 |\n| 10 | 770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.044 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-2621:** Chain: two threads in a web browser use the same resource (CWE-366), but one of those threads can destroy the resource before the other has completed (CWE-416).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nRace Condition\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-691\nCanPrecede -> CWE-416\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.\n\n**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a resource has not been properly initialized, the product may behave unexpectedly. This may lead to a crash or invalid memory access, but the consequences vary depending on the type of resource and how it is used within the product.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-665\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-9805:** Chain: Creation of the packet client occurs before initialization is complete (CWE-696) resulting in a read from uninitialized memory (CWE-908), causing memory corruption.\n- **CVE-2008-4197:** Use of uninitialized memory may allow code execution.\n- **CVE-2008-2934:** Free of an uninitialized pointer leads to crash and possible code execution.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nCanPrecede -> CWE-117\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-1771:** CRLF injection enables spam proxy (add mail headers) using email address or name.\n- **CVE-2002-1783:** CRLF injection in API function arguments modify headers for outgoing requests.\n- **CVE-2004-1513:** Spoofed entries in web server log file via carriage returns\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n### Extended Description\nMany resources require initialization before they can be properly used. If a resource is not initialized, it could contain unpredictable or expired data, or it could be initialized to defaults that are invalid. This can have security implications when the resource is expected to have certain properties or values.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nCanPrecede -> CWE-908\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-20739:** A variable that has its value set in a conditional statement is sometimes used when the conditional fails, sometimes causing data leakage\n- **CVE-2005-1036:** Chain: Bypass of access restrictions due to improper authorization (CWE-862) of a user results from an improperly initialized (CWE-909) I/O permission bitmap\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSpecified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-789\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop\n- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes output that is written to logs.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis can allow an attacker to forge log entries or inject malicious content into logs.\n\n\nLog forging vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Data enters an application from an untrusted source.\n\n  1. The data is written to an application or system log file.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-116\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2006-4624:** Chain: inject fake log entries with fake timestamps using CRLF injection\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nStack Exhaustion: When a weakness allocates excessive memory on the stack, it is often described as \"stack exhaustion,\" which is a technical impact of the weakness. This technical impact is often encountered as a consequence of CWE-789 and/or CWE-1325.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-770\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness can be closely associated with integer overflows (CWE-190). Integer overflow attacks would concentrate on providing an extremely large number that triggers an overflow that causes less memory to be allocated than expected. By providing a large value that does not trigger an integer overflow, the attacker could still cause excessive amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nUncontrolled memory allocation is possible in many languages, such as dynamic array allocation in perl or initial size parameters in Collections in Java. However, languages like C and C++ where programmers have the power to more directly control memory management will be more susceptible.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2010-3701:** program uses ::alloca() for encoding messages, but large messages trigger segfault\n- **CVE-2008-1708:** memory consumption and daemon exit by specifying a large value in a length field\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis can happen in signed and unsigned cases.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInteger underflow: \n\n\"Integer underflow\" is sometimes used to identify signedness errors in which an originally positive number becomes negative as a result of subtraction. However, there are cases of bad subtraction in which unsigned integers are involved, so it's not always a signedness issue.\n\n\n\"Integer underflow\" is occasionally used to describe array index errors in which the index is negative.\n\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2004-0816:** Integer underflow in firewall via malformed packet.\n- **CVE-2004-1002:** Integer underflow by packet with invalid length.\n- **CVE-2005-0199:** Long input causes incorrect length calculation.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCode frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-400\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-400\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).\n\n**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. \"Resource exhaustion\" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..\n- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.\n\n",
