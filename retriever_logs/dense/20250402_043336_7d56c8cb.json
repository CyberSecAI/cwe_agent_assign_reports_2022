  "query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions an attacker can trigger undefined behavior, **integer overflows**, segfaults and `CHECK`-fail crashes if they can change saved checkpoints from outside of TensorFlow. This is because the checkpoints loading infrastructure is **missing validation for **invalid file formats****. The fixes will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick these commits on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'missing validation for invalid file formats'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1. CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer (Score: 789.50)\n\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized....\n\n### 2. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 743.33)\n\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....\n\n### 3. CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input (Score: 679.90)\n\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax....\n\n### 4. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 645.59)\n\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....\n\n### 5. CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types (Score: 643.67)\n\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur....\n\n## WEAKNESS: 'integer overflows'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.
