An attacker can bypass the captive portal authentication process by using the downgraded no authentication method, and access the protected network. For example, the attacker can simply set window.authType=0 in client-side JavaScript.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **does not check if the authentication method specified is allowed**\n- **impact:** bypass captive portal authentication process\n- **vector:** using downgraded no authentication method\n- **attacker:** attacker\n- **product:** TP-Link Omada SDN Software Controller\n- **version:** before 5.0.15\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44032:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability lies in the TP-Link Omada SDN Controller's captive portal API. It fails to properly check if the specified authentication method is enabled. Specifically, the API accepts the \"no-authentication\" method (authType=0) even when it's not configured in the controller's settings, allowing unauthorized access.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the configured authentication mechanisms of the captive portal.\n- **Missing Server-Side Validation:** The API lacks proper server-side validation to ensure the requested authentication method is actually enabled in the controller settings.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Network Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the captive portal's authentication and gain access to the protected network (either LAN or Wi-Fi).\n- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Once inside the network, the attacker can perform further malicious activities, such as reconnaissance, data exfiltration, or launching attacks against other devices in the network.\n- **Compromised Traceability:** Bypassing authentication makes it harder to track the attacker's activity within the network, as the user's identity cannot be determined.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs access to the network protected by the captive portal (LAN or Wi-Fi) to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Basic Network Knowledge:** No specific technical expertise is needed; the exploit is fairly straightforward.\n- **Access to Captive Portal:** The attacker must be able to reach the captive portal login page.\n- **Browser Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to use the browser\u2019s developer tools or an intercepting proxy to modify the authentication request.\n\n**Detailed Explanation of Exploitation:**\n\n1.  **Direct Browser Manipulation:**\n    *   The attacker opens the captive portal login page in a web browser.\n    *   Using the browser's JavaScript console (usually by pressing F12), the attacker sets the `window.authType` variable to `0`. This forces the login page to use the \"no authentication\" method.\n    *   The attacker submits the login form without entering any credentials.\n    *   The API, due to its vulnerability, grants network access.\n2.  **Interception Proxy Manipulation:**\n    *   Alternatively, the attacker can use an interception proxy tool (like Burp Suite) to intercept the request to `/portal/getPortalPageSetting`.\n    *   The attacker then modifies the received JSON response to set the `authType` value to `0` before forwarding it to the client.\n    *   This forces the client-side JavaScript to use the \"no authentication\" method.\n    *   The attacker can now proceed to access the network.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The vulnerability was found in TP-Link Omada Software Controller version 4.4.4 (Windows).\n- TP-Link released a fix for the vulnerability in version 5.0.15.\n- The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed.\n\nIn summary, CVE-2021-44032 allows attackers to bypass the captive portal's authentication on TP-Link Omada SDN Controllers by forcing the usage of the \"no authentication\" method, which the API improperly accepts. This provides unauthorized network access and can lead to further malicious activity.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 757 | Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.631 |\n| 2 | 347 | Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.408 |\n| 3 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.399 |\n| 4 | 862 | Missing Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.396 |\n| 5 | 306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.392 |\n| 6 | 291 | Reliance on IP Address for Authentication | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.547 |\n| 7 | 472 | External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.386 |\n| 9 | 290 | Authentication Bypass by Spoofing | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.382 |\n| 10 | 287 | Improper Authentication | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.381 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nA protocol or its implementation supports interaction between multiple actors and allows those actors to negotiate which algorithm should be used as a protection mechanism such as encryption or authentication, but it does not select the strongest algorithm that is available to both parties.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a security mechanism can be forced to downgrade to use a less secure algorithm, this can make it easier for attackers to compromise the product by exploiting weaker algorithm.

Attackers can forge the source IP address of the packets they send, but response packets will return to the forged IP address. To see the response packets, the attacker has to sniff the traffic between the victim machine and the forged IP address. In order to accomplish the required sniffing, attackers typically attempt to locate themselves on the same subnet as the victim machine. Attackers may be able to circumvent this requirement by using source routing, but source routing is disabled across much of the Internet today. In summary, IP address verification can be a useful part of an authentication scheme, but it should not be the single factor required for authentication.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-290\nChildOf -> CWE-923\nChildOf -> CWE-471\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAssumed-Immutable Parameter Tampering\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-471\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Attackers can forge the source IP address of the packets they send, but response packets will return to the forged IP address. To see the response packets, the attacker has to sniff the traffic between the victim machine and the forged IP address. In order to accomplish the required sniffing, attackers typically attempt to locate themselves on the same subnet as the victim machine. Attackers may be able to circumvent this requirement by using source routing, but source routing is disabled across much of the Internet today. In summary, IP address verification can be a useful part of an authentication scheme, but it should not be the single factor required for authentication.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-290\nChildOf -> CWE-923\nChildOf -> CWE-471\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAssumed-Immutable Parameter Tampering\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-471\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
