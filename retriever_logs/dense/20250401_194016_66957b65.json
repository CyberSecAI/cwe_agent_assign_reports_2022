Continued receipted of these specific traffic will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX Series All versions prior to 17.3R3-S11 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S13, 17.4R3-S4 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S12 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S8, 18.2R3-S7 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S4 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S8, 18.4R2-S7, 18.4R3-S7 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S6, 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3-S4 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S6, 19.2R3-S2 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S1 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S3, 19.4R3-S1 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2, 20.1R3 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2, 20.2R3 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R1-S1, 20.3R2.

CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions (Score: 3406.88)\n\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product....\n\n### 2. CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime (Score: 2887.92)\n\nThe product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory....\n\n### 3. CWE-606: Unchecked Input for Loop Condition (Score: 2772.53)\n\nThe product does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping....\n\n### 4. CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input (Score: 2755.67)\n\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax....\n\n### 5. CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool (Score: 2752.27)\n\nThe product's resource pool is not large enough to handle peak demand, which allows an attacker to prevent others from accessing the resource by using a (relatively) large number of requests for resources....\n\n## ROOTCAUSE: 'Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
