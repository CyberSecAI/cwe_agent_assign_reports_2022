  "query": "## Vulnerability Description\nAn issue was discovered on Enphase Envoy R3.x and D4.x devices. There is a custom PAM module for user authentication that circumvents traditional user authentication. This module uses a password derived from the MD5 hash of the username and serial number. The serial number can be retrieved by an unauthenticated user at /info.xml. Attempts to change the user password via passwd or other tools have no effect.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **weakness:** **weak password**\n- **attacker:** unauthenticated user\n- **product:** Enphase Envoy R3.x and D4.x devices\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis regarding CVE-2020-25754:\n\n**1. Verification:**\n   - The provided text discusses vulnerabilities in Enphase Envoy solar power controllers, and it explicitly mentions CVE-2020-25755. While it does not discuss CVE-2020-25754 directly, the described weaknesses and vulnerabilities are likely related to that CVE. This is based on the information provided in the content, which details a series of vulnerabilities discovered in the Enphase Envoy controller. \n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**\n   - **Hardcoded Credentials:** The primary issue is the use of a custom PAM authentication module (`pam_emu.so`) that relies on hardcoded passwords derived from the device's serial number and usernames (e.g., \"installer,\" \"root,\" \"pebuser,\" \"enphase\"). These passwords are predictable and easily calculated.\n   - **Command Injection:** The `/installer/upgrade_start` function allows for command injection via the `force` query parameter.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n   - **Predictable Passwords:** Passwords for various user accounts (including root) are generated by a simple MD5 hash of a known string, including the device's serial number, and the username making them predictable.\n   - **Authentication Bypass:**  The custom PAM module bypasses the standard Linux user authentication mechanism, rendering the `/etc/shadow` file ineffective.\n   - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The system is vulnerable to command injection through the web interface, allowing remote code execution.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n   - **Full System Control:** Attackers can gain root access to the Enphase Envoy controller via SSH.\n   - **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify system data, including energy production statistics.\n   - **False SREC generation**: Attackers can generate false solar renewable energy certificates by manipulating the data sent to the SREC program.\n   - **Potential Botnet Inclusion**: The compromised devices could become part of botnets.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors:**\n   - **Network Access:** Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities if they can access the device on the local network or remotely if the device is exposed to the Internet.\n   - **Web Interface:** The command injection vulnerability is exploitable via the web interface.\n   - **SSH:** Once the hardcoded credentials are known, the attacker can gain remote shell access via SSH.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n   - **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to access the Enphase Envoy device's network interface.\n    - **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs a moderate level of technical knowledge to understand the device, its software, and how to generate the passwords.\n    - **Serial number of the device:** The serial number of the targeted device is necessary to generate the passwords.\n    - **Ability to access and modify the SPI flash:** In order to be able to gain the initial console access and dump the firmware, the attacker needs to be able to connect to the SPI flash chip and modify it.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n   - The attacker reverse-engineered the installer application to extract the password generation method and the S3 bucket containing the firmware.\n   - The attacker exploited the U-boot bootloader to gain access to the device's storage and retrieve the firmware.\n   - The attacker found the `pam_emu.so` module and reverse engineered it to understand how authentication was being performed.\n\nWhile the content does not discuss CVE-2020-25754 directly it provides significant detail about related vulnerabilities discovered and exploited in Enphase Envoy controllers.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 916 | Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.583 |\n| 2 | 259 | Use of Hard-coded Password | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.434 |\n| 3 | 1391 | Use of Weak Credentials | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.364 |\n| 4 | 1393 | Use of Default Password | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.360 |\n| 5 | 522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.349 |\n| 6 | 836 | Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.575 |\n| 7 | 321 | Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key | Variant | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.346 |\n| 9 | 327 | Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.346 |\n| 10 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.342 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany password storage mechanisms compute a hash and store the hash, instead of storing the original password in plaintext. In this design, authentication involves accepting an incoming password, computing its hash, and comparing it to the stored hash.\n\n\nMany hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. However, this efficiency is a problem for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker's workload for brute-force password cracking. If an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method (such as SQL injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by computing hashes efficiently. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing (such as cloud computing) and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware. In such a scenario, an efficient hash algorithm helps the attacker.\n\n\nThere are several properties of a hash scheme that are relevant to its strength against an offline, massively-parallel attack:\n\n\n  - The amount of CPU time required to compute the hash (\"stretching\")\n\n  - The amount of memory required to compute the hash (\"memory-hard\" operations)\n\n  - Including a random value, along with the password, as input to the hash computation (\"salting\")\n\n  - Given a hash, there is no known way of determining an input (e.g., a password) that produces this hash value, other than by guessing possible inputs (\"one-way\" hashing)\n\n  - Relative to the number of all possible hashes that can be generated by the scheme, there is a low likelihood of producing the same hash for multiple different inputs (\"collision resistance\")\n\nNote that the security requirements for the product may vary depending on the environment and the value of the passwords. Different schemes might not provide all of these properties, yet may still provide sufficient security for the environment. Conversely, a solution might be very strong in preserving one property, which still being very weak for an attack against another property, or it might not be able to significantly reduce the efficiency of a massively-parallel attack.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-328\nChildOf -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2008-1526:** Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.\n- **CVE-2006-1058:** Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.\n- **CVE-2008-4905:** Blogging software uses a hard-coded salt when calculating a password hash.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nPeerOf -> CWE-321\nPeerOf -> CWE-257\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry could be split into multiple variants: an inbound variant (as seen in the second demonstrative example) and an outbound variant (as seen in the first demonstrative example). These variants are likely to have different consequences, detectability, etc. More importantly, from a vulnerability theory perspective, they could be characterized as different behaviors.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29964:** Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access\n- **CVE-2021-37555:** Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]\n- **CVE-2021-35033:** Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nBy design, authentication protocols try to ensure that attackers must perform brute force attacks if they do not know the credentials such as a key or password. However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.\n\n\nCredentials may be weak for different reasons, such as:\n\n\n  - Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)\n\n  - Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)\n\n  - Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be guessed with reasonable efficiency)\n\nEven if a new, unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **[REF-1374]:** Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)\n- **CVE-2022-30270:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses default credentials for some SSH accounts\n- **CVE-2022-29965:** Distributed Control System (DCS) uses a deterministic algorithm to generate utility passwords\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1393: Use of Default Password\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses default passwords for potentially critical functionality.\n\n### Extended Description\nIt is common practice for products to be designed to use default passwords for authentication. The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise. However, if admins do not change the defaults, then it makes it easier for attackers to quickly bypass authentication across multiple organizations. There are many lists of default passwords and default-password scanning tools that are easily available from the World Wide Web.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1392\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30270:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses default credentials for some SSH accounts\n- **CVE-2022-2336:** OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) industrial automation product has a default password\n- **CVE-2021-38759:** microcontroller board has default password\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30018:** A messaging platform serializes all elements of User/Group objects, making private information available to adversaries\n- **CVE-2022-29959:** Initialization file contains credentials that can be decoded using a \"simple string transformation\"\n- **CVE-2022-35411:** Python-based RPC framework enables pickle functionality by default, allowing clients to unpickle untrusted data.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-836: Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product records password hashes in a data store, receives a hash of a password from a client, and compares the supplied hash to the hash obtained from the data store.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSome authentication mechanisms rely on the client to generate the hash for a password, possibly to reduce load on the server or avoid sending the password across the network. However, when the client is used to generate the hash, an attacker can bypass the authentication by obtaining a copy of the hash, e.g. by using SQL injection to compromise a database of authentication credentials, or by exploiting an information exposure. The attacker could then use a modified client to replay the stolen hash without having knowledge of the original password.\n\n\nAs a result, the server-side comparison against a client-side hash does not provide any more security than the use of passwords without hashing.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\nPeerOf -> CWE-602\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2009-1283:** Product performs authentication with user-supplied password hashes that can be obtained from a separate SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2009-1282).\n- **CVE-2005-3435:** Product allows attackers to bypass authentication by obtaining the password hash for another user and specifying the hash in the pwd argument.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation\n- **CVE-2022-30271:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used by default.\n- **CVE-2020-10884:** WiFi router service has a hard-coded encryption key, allowing root access\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany communication channels can be \"sniffed\" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.\n\n\nApplicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.\n\n\nWhen full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to \"sniff\" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-311\nChildOf -> CWE-311\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29519:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends sensitive information in plaintext, including passwords and session tokens.\n- **CVE-2022-30312:** Building Controller uses a protocol that transmits authentication credentials in plaintext.\n- **CVE-2022-31204:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends password in plaintext.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\n\n\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \"unsafe\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\n\n\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\nPeerOf -> CWE-311\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication.
