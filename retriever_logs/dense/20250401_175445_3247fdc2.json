It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product generates a query intended to access or manipulate data in a data store such as a database, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended logic of the query.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nDepending on the capabilities of the query language, an attacker could inject additional logic into the query to:\n\n\n  - Modify the intended selection criteria, thus changing which data entities (e.g., records) are returned, modified, or otherwise manipulated\n\n  - Append additional commands to the query\n\n  - Return more entities than intended\n\n  - Return fewer entities than intended\n\n  - Cause entities to be sorted in an unexpected way\n\nThe ability to execute additional commands or change which entities are returned has obvious risks. But when the product logic depends on the order or number of entities, this can also lead to vulnerabilities. For example, if the query expects to return only one entity that specifies an administrative user, but an attacker can change which entities are returned, this could cause the logic to return information for a regular user and incorrectly assume that the user has administrative privileges.\n\nWhile this weakness is most commonly associated with SQL injection, there are many other query languages that are also subject to injection attacks, including HTSQL, LDAP, DQL, XQuery, Xpath, and \"NoSQL\" languages.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** It could be argued that data query languages are effectively a command language - albeit with a limited set of commands - and thus any query-language injection issue could be treated as a child of CWE-74. However, CWE-943 is intended to better organize query-oriented issues to separate them from fully-functioning programming languages, and also to provide a more precise identifier for the many query languages that do not have their own CWE identifier.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2014-2503:** Injection using Documentum Query Language (DQL)\n- **CVE-2014-2508:** Injection using Documentum Query Language (DQL)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-277: Insecure Inherited Permissions\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA product defines a set of insecure permissions that are inherited by objects that are created by the program.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-732\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The use of weak, reused, and common passwords is rampant on the internet. Without the added protection of multiple authentication schemes, a single mistake can result in the compromise of an account. For this reason, if multiple schemes are possible and also easy to use, they should be implemented and required.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\nChildOf -> CWE-654\nPeerOf -> CWE-309\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

If write access is not properly restricted, then attackers can modify and possibly delete the data, causing incorrect results and possibly a denial of service.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** There is an overlapping relationship between insecure storage of sensitive information (CWE-922) and missing encryption of sensitive information (CWE-311). Encryption is often used to prevent an attacker from reading the sensitive data. However, encryption does not prevent the attacker from erasing or overwriting the data. While data tampering would be visible upon inspection, the integrity and availability of the data is compromised prior to the audit.\n\n**[Maintenance]** This is a high-level entry that includes children from various parts of the CWE research view (CWE-1000). Currently, most of the information is in these child entries. This entry will be made more comprehensive in later CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison\n**Abstraction:** Pillar\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product compares two entities in a security-relevant context, but the comparison is incorrect, which may lead to resultant weaknesses.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis Pillar covers several possibilities:\n\n\n  - the comparison checks one factor incorrectly;\n\n  - the comparison should consider multiple factors, but it does not check at least one of those factors at all;\n\n  - the comparison checks the wrong factor.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nNone\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, sometimes this weakness is forced to be used due to the lack of in-depth weakness research. See Research Gaps.\n**Comments:** Where feasible, consider children or descendants of this entry instead.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nWeaknesses related to this Pillar appear to be under-studied, especially with respect to classification schemes. Input from academic and other communities could help identify and resolve gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** This entry likely has some relationships with case sensitivity (CWE-178), but case sensitivity is a factor in other types of weaknesses besides comparison. Also, in cryptography, certain attacks are possible when certain comparison operations do not take place in constant time, causing a timing-related information leak (CWE-208).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)\n- **CVE-2020-15811:** Chain: Proxy uses a substring search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header (CWE-697), allowing request splitting (CWE-113) and cache poisoning\n- **CVE-2016-10003:** Proxy performs incorrect comparison of request headers, leading to infoleak\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-691\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-9805:** Chain: Creation of the packet client occurs before initialization is complete (CWE-696) resulting in a read from uninitialized memory (CWE-908), causing memory corruption.\n- **CVE-2007-5191:** file-system management programs call the setuid and setgid functions in the wrong order and do not check the return values, allowing attackers to gain unintended privileges\n- **CVE-2007-1588:** C++ web server program calls Process::setuid before calling Process::setgid, preventing it from dropping privileges, potentially allowing CGI programs to be called with higher privileges than intended\n\n",

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product stores sensitive information without properly limiting read or write access by unauthorized actors.\n\n### Extended Description\nIf read access is not properly restricted, then attackers can steal the sensitive information. If write access is not properly restricted, then attackers can modify and possibly delete the data, causing incorrect results and possibly a denial of service.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** There is an overlapping relationship between insecure storage of sensitive information (CWE-922) and missing encryption of sensitive information (CWE-311). Encryption is often used to prevent an attacker from reading the sensitive data. However, encryption does not prevent the attacker from erasing or overwriting the data. While data tampering would be visible upon inspection, the integrity and availability of the data is compromised prior to the audit.\n\n**[Maintenance]** This is a high-level entry that includes children from various parts of the CWE research view (CWE-1000). Currently, most of the information is in these child entries. This entry will be made more comprehensive in later CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison\n**Abstraction:** Pillar\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product compares two entities in a security-relevant context, but the comparison is incorrect, which may lead to resultant weaknesses.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis Pillar covers several possibilities:\n\n\n  - the comparison checks one factor incorrectly;\n\n  - the comparison should consider multiple factors, but it does not check at least one of those factors at all;\n\n  - the comparison checks the wrong factor.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nNone\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, sometimes this weakness is forced to be used due to the lack of in-depth weakness research. See Research Gaps.\n**Comments:** Where feasible, consider children or descendants of this entry instead.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nWeaknesses related to this Pillar appear to be under-studied, especially with respect to classification schemes. Input from academic and other communities could help identify and resolve gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE.\n\n\n**[Maintenance]** This entry likely has some relationships with case sensitivity (CWE-178), but case sensitivity is a factor in other types of weaknesses besides comparison. Also, in cryptography, certain attacks are possible when certain comparison operations do not take place in constant time, causing a timing-related information leak (CWE-208).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)\n- **CVE-2020-15811:** Chain: Proxy uses a substring search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header (CWE-697), allowing request splitting (CWE-113) and cache poisoning\n- **CVE-2016-10003:** Proxy performs incorrect comparison of request headers, leading to infoleak\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-691\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-9805:** Chain: Creation of the packet client occurs before initialization is complete (CWE-696) resulting in a read from uninitialized memory (CWE-908), causing memory corruption.\n- **CVE-2007-5191:** file-system management programs call the setuid and setgid functions in the wrong order and do not check the return values, allowing attackers to gain unintended privileges\n- **CVE-2007-1588:** C++ web server program calls Process::setuid before calling Process::setgid, preventing it from dropping privileges, potentially allowing CGI programs to be called with higher privileges than intended\n\n"
