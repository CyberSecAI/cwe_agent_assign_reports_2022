  "query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    NVIDIA vGPU driver contains a vulnerability in the Virtual GPU Manager (vGPU plugin), where there is the potential to **write to a shared memory location** and **manipulate the data after the data has been validated**, which may lead to denial of service and escalation of privileges and information disclosure but attacker doesnt have control over what information is obtained. This affects vGPU version 12.x (prior to 12.2), version 11.x (prior to 11.4) and version 8.x (prior to 8.7).\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## WEAKNESS: 'write to a shared memory location'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.
