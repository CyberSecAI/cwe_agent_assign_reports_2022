It uses this header instead of the actual `REMOTE_ADDR` to check if a user is accessing the application from a \"local\" network.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Authentication Bypass:** By manipulating the `X-Forwarded-For` header and inserting a local/loopback IP address (e.g., 127.0.0.1 or any IP matching the configured local network), an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism. The application's logic incorrectly assumes that if the IP in `X-Forwarded-For` is local, the request is from a trusted source, and thus bypasses login requirements.\n*   **IP Address Spoofing:** The vulnerability stems from the application's reliance on a user-controlled header (`X-Forwarded-For`) for security decisions.\n*   **Insecure IP Address Verification:** The `isIpLocal()` function does not properly validate if the request originates from a local network.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Complete Takeover:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the HomeAutomation system, potentially granting full control of connected smart devices.\n*   **Remote Control:** An attacker can control devices (switches, dimmers, etc.), access sensor data, and modify schedules.\n*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can view system configurations, user data, and sensitive information related to connected devices.\n*   **Integrity Violation:** Attackers can modify configurations, schedules, or device status, leading to denial of service or unexpected behavior of the smart home.\n*   **Availability Disruption:** Attackers can cause device malfunctions or disrupt scheduling, rendering the home automation system unavailable.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network-Based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.\n*   **HTTP Header Manipulation:** Attackers must craft malicious HTTP requests that include a spoofed IP address within the `X-Forwarded-For` header.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable web interface over the network.\n*   **HTTP Request Crafting:** The attacker must be capable of generating and sending custom HTTP requests.\n*   **Understanding of `X-Forwarded-For` header:** The attacker must know how to manipulate the `X-Forwarded-For` header to insert a local IP address.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 290 | Authentication Bypass by Spoofing | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.093 |\n| 2 | 295 | Improper Certificate Validation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.069 |\n| 3 | 348 | Use of Less Trusted Source | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.062 |\n| 4 | 291 | Reliance on IP Address for Authentication | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.062 |\n| 5 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.060 |\n| 6 | 305 | Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.549 |\n| 7 | 294 | Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.060 |\n| 9 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.057 |\n| 10 | 93 | Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.056 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThis attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from insufficient verification.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30319:** S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which can be bypassed by a forged IP address.\n- **CVE-2009-1048:** VOIP product allows authentication bypass using 127.0.0.1 in the Host header.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client. The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nPeerOf -> CWE-322\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).\n- **CVE-2021-22909:** Chain: router's firmware update procedure uses curl with \"-k\" (insecure) option that disables certificate validation (CWE-295), allowing adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) compromise with a malicious firmware image (CWE-494).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-348: Use of Less Trusted Source\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product has two different sources of the same data or information, but it uses the source that has less support for verification, is less trusted, or is less resistant to attack.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-0860:** Product uses IP address provided by a client, instead of obtaining it from the packet headers, allowing easier spoofing.\n- **CVE-2004-1950:** Web product uses the IP address in the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header instead of a server variable that uses the connecting IP address, allowing filter bypass.\n- **CVE-2001-0908:** Product logs IP address specified by the client instead of obtaining it from the packet headers, allowing information hiding.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-291: Reliance on IP Address for Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses an IP address for authentication.\n\n### Extended Description\nIP addresses can be easily spoofed. Attackers can forge the source IP address of the packets they send, but response packets will return to the forged IP address. To see the response packets, the attacker has to sniff the traffic between the victim machine and the forged IP address. In order to accomplish the required sniffing, attackers typically attempt to locate themselves on the same subnet as the victim machine. Attackers may be able to circumvent this requirement by using source routing, but source routing is disabled across much of the Internet today. In summary, IP address verification can be a useful part of an authentication scheme, but it should not be the single factor required for authentication.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-290\nChildOf -> CWE-923\nChildOf -> CWE-471\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
