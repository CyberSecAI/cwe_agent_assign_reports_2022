These processors use sophisticated decoding and caching of the instruction stream for performance improvements.\n- When self-modifying code updates occur, the changes might not take effect immediately due to caching.\n- Some CPUs may speculatively decode and execute the stale instruction stream leading to type confusion in registers, and potentially data leaks\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Speculative Code Store Bypass (SCSB):** The core vulnerability is the speculative execution of stale instructions after a code modification. This can lead to type confusion and information disclosure.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- An attacker could potentially infer the contents of arbitrary host memory, which may include memory assigned to other guests in a virtualized environment. This could lead to information leaks of sensitive data.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack vector is through the execution of self-modifying code.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the affected system and have the ability to modify code that would be executed speculatively. This can be achieved by running code in a virtual machine.\n- Local access is required.\n- No special user privileges required.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability affects systems running all versions of Xen, but the vulnerability depends on the underlying CPU microarchitecture.\n- Xen on ARM is believed not to be vulnerable due to the lack of runtime self-modifying code. However, Xen on x86, which does have runtime self-modifying code as part of emulation, is believed to be potentially vulnerable.\n- Mitigation is possible by enabling Spectre v2 mitigations like retpoline or lfence.\n- The vulnerability is also referred to as XSA-375 in the Xen Security Advisory.\n- The vulnerability is associated with CVE-2021-26313 as well on AMD systems.\n- Intel recommends process isolation, placing serializing operations or LFENCE operations between code generation and execution as mitigations.\n\n**Mitigations:**\n- Use `spec-ctrl=bti-thunk=retpoline` or `spec-ctrl=bti-thunk=lfence` to enable RETPOLINE or LFENCE mitigations if Spectre v2 support is compiled in.\n- Ensure the SPECULATIVE_HARDEN_BRANCH hypervisor config option is enabled (4.13 and newer versions).\n\nThe provided information includes details beyond the basic CVE description, including specific affected systems, mitigation strategies, and related advisories.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 204 | Observable Response Discrepancy | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.233 |\n| 2 | 205 | Observable Behavioral Discrepancy | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.218 |\n| 3 | 208 | Observable Timing Discrepancy | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.195 |\n| 4 | 1256 | Improper Restriction of Software Interfaces to Hardware Features | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.189 |\n| 5 | 203 | Observable Discrepancy | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.163 |\n| 6 | 1421 | Exposure of Sensitive Information in Shared Microarchitectural Structures during Transient Execution | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.619 |\n| 7 | 385 | Covert Timing Channel | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 691 | Insufficient Control Flow Management | Pillar | Discouraged | sparse | 0.156 |\n| 9 | 453 | Insecure Default Variable Initialization | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.141 |\n| 10 | 693 | Protection Mechanism Failure | Pillar | Discouraged | sparse | 0.131 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis issue frequently occurs during authentication, where a difference in failed-login messages could allow an attacker to determine if the username is valid or not.

The CWE team is developing an alternative.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies\n- **CVE-2019-10482:** Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels\n- **CVE-2014-0984:** Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1256: Improper Restriction of Software Interfaces to Hardware Features\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product provides software-controllable\n\t\t\tdevice functionality for capabilities such as power and\n\t\t\tclock management, but it does not properly limit\n\t\t\tfunctionality that can lead to modification of\n\t\t\thardware memory or register bits, or the ability to\n\t\t\tobserve physical side channels.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIt is frequently assumed that physical attacks such as fault injection and side-channel analysis require an attacker to have physical access to the target device. This assumption may be false if the device has improperly secured power management features, or similar features. For mobile devices, minimizing power consumption is critical, but these devices run a wide variety of applications with different performance requirements. Software-controllable mechanisms to dynamically scale device voltage and frequency and monitor power consumption are common features in today's chipsets, but they also enable attackers to mount fault injection and side-channel attacks without having physical access to the device.\n\n\nFault injection attacks involve strategic manipulation of bits in a device to achieve a desired effect such as skipping an authentication step, elevating privileges, or altering the output of a cryptographic operation. Manipulation of the device clock and voltage supply is a well-known technique to inject faults and is cheap to implement with physical device access. Poorly protected power management features allow these attacks to be performed from software. Other features, such as the ability to write repeatedly to DRAM at a rapid rate from unprivileged software, can result in bit flips in other memory locations (Rowhammer, [REF-1083]).\n\n\nSide channel analysis requires gathering measurement traces of physical quantities such as power consumption. Modern processors often include power metering capabilities in the hardware itself (e.g., Intel RAPL) which if not adequately protected enable attackers to gather measurements necessary for performing side-channel attacks from software.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-11157:** Plundervolt: Improper conditions check in voltage settings for some Intel(R) Processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege and/or information disclosure via local access [REF-1081].\n- **CVE-2020-8694:** PLATYPUS Attack: Insufficient access control in the Linux kernel driver for some Intel processors allows information disclosure.\n- **CVE-2020-8695:** Observable discrepancy in the RAPL interface for some Intel processors allows information disclosure.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n### Extended Description\nDiscrepancies can take many forms, and variations may be detectable in timing, control flow, communications such as replies or requests, or general behavior. These discrepancies can reveal information about the product's operation or internal state to an unauthorized actor. In some cases, discrepancies can be used by attackers to form a side channel.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSide Channel Attack: Observable Discrepancies are at the root of side channel attacks.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nChildOf -> CWE-200\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-8695:** Observable discrepancy in the RAPL interface for some Intel processors allows information disclosure.\n- **CVE-2019-14353:** Crypto hardware wallet's power consumption relates to total number of pixels illuminated, creating a side channel in the USB connection that allows attackers to determine secrets displayed such as PIN numbers and passwords\n- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1421: Exposure of Sensitive Information in Shared Microarchitectural Structures during Transient Execution\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\n\n\t\t\tA processor event may allow transient operations to access\n\t\t\tarchitecturally restricted data (for example, in another address\n\t\t\tspace) in a shared microarchitectural structure (for example, a CPU\n\t\t\tcache), potentially exposing the data over a covert channel.\n\t\t  \n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany commodity processors have Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) features that protect software components from one another. These features can include memory segmentation, virtual memory, privilege rings, trusted execution environments, and virtual machines, among others. For example, virtual memory provides each process with its own address space, which prevents processes from accessing each other's private data. Many of these features can be used to form hardware-enforced security boundaries between software components.\n\n\nMany commodity processors also share microarchitectural resources that cache (temporarily store) data, which may be confidential. These resources may be shared across processor contexts, including across SMT threads, privilege rings, or others.\n\n\nWhen transient operations allow access to ISA-protected data in a shared microarchitectural resource, this might violate users' expectations of the ISA feature that is bypassed. For example, if transient operations can access a victim's private data in a shared microarchitectural resource, then the operations' microarchitectural side effects may correspond to the accessed data. If an attacker can trigger these transient operations and observe their side effects through a covert channel [REF-1400], then the attacker may be able to infer the victim's private data. Private data could include sensitive program data, OS/VMM data, page table data (such as memory addresses), system configuration data (see Demonstrative Example 3), or any other data that the attacker does not have the required privileges to access.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1420\nChildOf -> CWE-1420\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities\n**Comments:** If a weakness can potentially be exploited to infer data that is accessible inside or outside the current processor context, then the weakness could map to CWE-1421 and to another CWE such as CWE-1420.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2017-5715:** A fault may allow transient user-mode operations to access kernel data cached in the L1D, potentially exposing the data over a covert channel.\n- **CVE-2018-3615:** A fault may allow transient non-enclave operations to access SGX enclave data cached in the L1D, potentially exposing the data over a covert channel.\n- **CVE-2019-1135:** A TSX Asynchronous Abort may allow transient operations to access architecturally restricted data, potentially exposing the data over a covert channel.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-385: Covert Timing Channel\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nCovert timing channels convey information by modulating some aspect of system behavior over time, so that the program receiving the information can observe system behavior and infer protected information.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIn some instances, knowing when data is transmitted between parties can provide a malicious user with privileged information. Also, externally monitoring the timing of operations can potentially reveal sensitive data. For example, a cryptographic operation can expose its internal state if the time it takes to perform the operation varies, based on the state.\n\n\nCovert channels are frequently classified as either storage or timing channels. Some examples of covert timing channels are the system's paging rate, the time a certain transaction requires to execute, and the time it takes to gain access to a shared bus.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-514\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.9, members of the CWE Hardware SIG are working to improve CWE's coverage of transient execution weaknesses, which include issues related to Spectre, Meltdown, and other attacks that create or exploit covert channels. As a result of that work, this entry might change in CWE 4.10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\n**Abstraction:** Pillar\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nNone\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.\n**Comments:** Where feasible, consider children or descendants of this entry instead.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-9805:** Chain: Creation of the packet client occurs before initialization is complete (CWE-696) resulting in a read from uninitialized memory (CWE-908), causing memory corruption.\n- **CVE-2014-1266:** chain: incorrect \"goto\" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple \"goto fail\" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).\n- **CVE-2011-1027:** Chain: off-by-one error (CWE-193) leads to infinite loop (CWE-835) using invalid hex-encoded characters.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-453: Insecure Default Variable Initialization\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product, by default, initializes an internal variable with an insecure or less secure value than is possible.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1188\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This overlaps other categories, probably should be split into separate items.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-36349:** insecure default variable initialization in BIOS firmware for a hardware board allows DoS\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\n**Abstraction:** Pillar\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness covers three distinct situations. A \"missing\" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An \"insufficient\" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an \"ignored\" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nNone\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants of this entry instead.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** The concept of protection mechanisms is well established, but protection mechanism failures have not been studied comprehensively. It is suspected that protection mechanisms can have significantly different types of weaknesses than the weaknesses that they are intended to prevent.\n\n\n\n",

The CWE team is developing an alternative.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies\n- **CVE-2019-10482:** Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels\n- **CVE-2014-0984:** Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1256: Improper Restriction of Software Interfaces to Hardware Features\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product provides software-controllable\n\t\t\tdevice functionality for capabilities such as power and\n\t\t\tclock management, but it does not properly limit\n\t\t\tfunctionality that can lead to modification of\n\t\t\thardware memory or register bits, or the ability to\n\t\t\tobserve physical side channels.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIt is frequently assumed that physical attacks such as fault injection and side-channel analysis require an attacker to have physical access to the target device. This assumption may be false if the device has improperly secured power management features, or similar features. For mobile devices, minimizing power consumption is critical, but these devices run a wide variety of applications with different performance requirements. Software-controllable mechanisms to dynamically scale device voltage and frequency and monitor power consumption are common features in today's chipsets, but they also enable attackers to mount fault injection and side-channel attacks without having physical access to the device.\n\n\nFault injection attacks involve strategic manipulation of bits in a device to achieve a desired effect such as skipping an authentication step, elevating privileges, or altering the output of a cryptographic operation. Manipulation of the device clock and voltage supply is a well-known technique to inject faults and is cheap to implement with physical device access. Poorly protected power management features allow these attacks to be performed from software. Other features, such as the ability to write repeatedly to DRAM at a rapid rate from unprivileged software, can result in bit flips in other memory locations (Rowhammer, [REF-1083]).\n\n\nSide channel analysis requires gathering measurement traces of physical quantities such as power consumption. Modern processors often include power metering capabilities in the hardware itself (e.g., Intel RAPL) which if not adequately protected enable attackers to gather measurements necessary for performing side-channel attacks from software.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-11157:** Plundervolt: Improper conditions check in voltage settings for some Intel(R) Processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege and/or information disclosure via local access [REF-1081].\n- **CVE-2020-8694:** PLATYPUS Attack: Insufficient access control in the Linux kernel driver for some Intel processors allows information disclosure.\n- **CVE-2020-8695:** Observable discrepancy in the RAPL interface for some Intel processors allows information disclosure.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n### Extended Description\nDiscrepancies can take many forms, and variations may be detectable in timing, control flow, communications such as replies or requests, or general behavior. These discrepancies can reveal information about the product's operation or internal state to an unauthorized actor. In some cases, discrepancies can be used by attackers to form a side channel.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSide Channel Attack: Observable Discrepancies are at the root of side channel attacks.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nChildOf -> CWE-200\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-8695:** Observable discrepancy in the RAPL interface for some Intel processors allows information disclosure.\n- **CVE-2019-14353:** Crypto hardware wallet's power consumption relates to total number of pixels illuminated, creating a side channel in the USB connection that allows attackers to determine secrets displayed such as PIN numbers and passwords\n- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1421: Exposure of Sensitive Information in Shared Microarchitectural Structures during Transient Execution\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\n\n\t\t\tA processor event may allow transient operations to access\n\t\t\tarchitecturally restricted data (for example, in another address\n\t\t\tspace) in a shared microarchitectural structure (for example, a CPU\n\t\t\tcache), potentially exposing the data over a covert channel.\n\t\t  \n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany commodity processors have Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) features that protect software components from one another. These features can include memory segmentation, virtual memory, privilege rings, trusted execution environments, and virtual machines, among others. For example, virtual memory provides each process with its own address space, which prevents processes from accessing each other's private data. Many of these features can be used to form hardware-enforced security boundaries between software components.\n\n\nMany commodity processors also share microarchitectural resources that cache (temporarily store) data, which may be confidential. These resources may be shared across processor contexts, including across SMT threads, privilege rings, or others.\n\n\nWhen transient operations allow access to ISA-protected data in a shared microarchitectural resource, this might violate users' expectations of the ISA feature that is bypassed. For example, if transient operations can access a victim's private data in a shared microarchitectural resource, then the operations' microarchitectural side effects may correspond to the accessed data. If an attacker can trigger these transient operations and observe their side effects through a covert channel [REF-1400], then the attacker may be able to infer the victim's private data. Private data could include sensitive program data, OS/VMM data, page table data (such as memory addresses), system configuration data (see Demonstrative Example 3), or any other data that the attacker does not have the required privileges to access.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1420\nChildOf -> CWE-1420\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities\n**Comments:** If a weakness can potentially be exploited to infer data that is accessible inside or outside the current processor context, then the weakness could map to CWE-1421 and to another CWE such as CWE-1420.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2017-5715:** A fault may allow transient user-mode operations to access kernel data cached in the L1D, potentially exposing the data over a covert channel.\n- **CVE-2018-3615:** A fault may allow transient non-enclave operations to access SGX enclave data cached in the L1D, potentially exposing the data over a covert channel.\n- **CVE-2019-1135:** A TSX Asynchronous Abort may allow transient operations to access architecturally restricted data, potentially exposing the data over a covert channel.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-385: Covert Timing Channel\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nCovert timing channels convey information by modulating some aspect of system behavior over time, so that the program receiving the information can observe system behavior and infer protected information.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIn some instances, knowing when data is transmitted between parties can provide a malicious user with privileged information. Also, externally monitoring the timing of operations can potentially reveal sensitive data. For example, a cryptographic operation can expose its internal state if the time it takes to perform the operation varies, based on the state.\n\n\nCovert channels are frequently classified as either storage or timing channels. Some examples of covert timing channels are the system's paging rate, the time a certain transaction requires to execute, and the time it takes to gain access to a shared bus.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-514\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.9, members of the CWE Hardware SIG are working to improve CWE's coverage of transient execution weaknesses, which include issues related to Spectre, Meltdown, and other attacks that create or exploit covert channels. As a result of that work, this entry might change in CWE 4.10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\n**Abstraction:** Pillar\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nNone\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.\n**Comments:** Where feasible, consider children or descendants of this entry instead.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-9805:** Chain: Creation of the packet client occurs before initialization is complete (CWE-696) resulting in a read from uninitialized memory (CWE-908), causing memory corruption.\n- **CVE-2014-1266:** chain: incorrect \"goto\" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple \"goto fail\" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).\n- **CVE-2011-1027:** Chain: off-by-one error (CWE-193) leads to infinite loop (CWE-835) using invalid hex-encoded characters.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-453: Insecure Default Variable Initialization\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product, by default, initializes an internal variable with an insecure or less secure value than is possible.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1188\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This overlaps other categories, probably should be split into separate items.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-36349:** insecure default variable initialization in BIOS firmware for a hardware board allows DoS\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\n**Abstraction:** Pillar\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness covers three distinct situations. A \"missing\" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An \"insufficient\" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an \"ignored\" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nNone\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants of this entry instead.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** The concept of protection mechanisms is well established, but protection mechanism failures have not been studied comprehensively. It is suspected that protection mechanisms can have significantly different types of weaknesses than the weaknesses that they are intended to prevent.\n\n\n\n"
