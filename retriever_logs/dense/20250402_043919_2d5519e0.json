This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nBuffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean \"write past the end of a buffer,\" whereas others use the same term to mean \"any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer.\" Others could mean \"any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write.\" Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.\nbuffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term \"buffer overrun,\" but most people use \"buffer overflow.\" See the alternate term for \"buffer overflow\" for context.\nmemory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the \"memory safety\" term.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-118\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nIt is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1173: Improper Use of Validation Framework\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not use, or incorrectly uses, an input validation framework that is provided by the source language or an independent library.\n\n### Extended Description\nMany modern coding languages provide developers with input validation frameworks to make the task of input validation easier and less error-prone. These frameworks will automatically check all input against specified criteria and direct execution to error handlers when invalid input is received. The improper use (i.e., an incorrect implementation or missing altogether) of these frameworks is not directly exploitable, but can lead to an exploitable condition if proper input validation is not performed later in the product. Not using provided input validation frameworks can also hurt the maintainability of code as future developers may not recognize the downstream input validation being used in the place of the validation framework.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-1841:** User's umask is used when creating temp files.\n- **CVE-2002-1786:** Insecure umask for core dumps [is the umask preserved or assigned?].\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-354: Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not validate or incorrectly validates the integrity check values or \"checksums\" of a message. This may prevent it from detecting if the data has been modified or corrupted in transmission.\n\n### Extended Description\nImproper validation of checksums before use results in an unnecessary risk that can easily be mitigated. The protocol specification describes the algorithm used for calculating the checksum. It is then a simple matter of implementing the calculation and verifying that the calculated checksum and the received checksum match. Improper verification of the calculated checksum and the received checksum can lead to far greater consequences.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-754\nPeerOf -> CWE-353\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nout-of-bounds array index\nindex-out-of-range\narray index underflow\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1285\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-823\nCanPrecede -> CWE-789\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness can precede uncontrolled memory allocation (CWE-789) in languages that automatically expand an array when an index is used that is larger than the size of the array, such as JavaScript.\n\n**[Theoretical]** An improperly validated array index might lead directly to the always-incorrect behavior of \"access of array using out-of-bounds index.\"\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-0369:** large ID in packet used as array index\n- **CVE-2001-1009:** negative array index as argument to POP LIST command\n- **CVE-2003-0721:** Integer signedness error leads to negative array index\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\n**Abstraction:** Pillar\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness covers three distinct situations. A \"missing\" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An \"insufficient\" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an \"ignored\" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nNone\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants of this entry instead.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** The concept of protection mechanisms is well established, but protection mechanism failures have not been studied comprehensively. It is suspected that protection mechanisms can have significantly different types of weaknesses than the weaknesses that they are intended to prevent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\n**Abstraction:** Pillar\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nNone\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.\n**Comments:** Where feasible, consider children or descendants of this entry instead.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-9805:** Chain: Creation of the packet client occurs before initialization is complete (CWE-696) resulting in a read from uninitialized memory (CWE-908), causing memory corruption.\n- **CVE-2014-1266:** chain: incorrect \"goto\" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple \"goto fail\" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).\n- **CVE-2011-1027:** Chain: off-by-one error (CWE-193) leads to infinite loop (CWE-835) using invalid hex-encoded characters.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nWhen an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nauthentification: An alternate term is \"authentification\", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.\nAuthN: \"AuthN\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authentication\" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from \"AuthZ,\" which is an abbreviation of \"authorization.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\nAuthC: \"AuthC\" is used as an abbreviation of \"authentication,\" but it appears to used less frequently than \"AuthN.\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n\n",

Improper verification of the calculated checksum and the received checksum can lead to far greater consequences.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-754\nPeerOf -> CWE-353\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nout-of-bounds array index\nindex-out-of-range\narray index underflow\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1285\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\nCanPrecede -> CWE-823\nCanPrecede -> CWE-789\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness can precede uncontrolled memory allocation (CWE-789) in languages that automatically expand an array when an index is used that is larger than the size of the array, such as JavaScript.\n\n**[Theoretical]** An improperly validated array index might lead directly to the always-incorrect behavior of \"access of array using out-of-bounds index.\"\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-0369:** large ID in packet used as array index\n- **CVE-2001-1009:** negative array index as argument to POP LIST command\n- **CVE-2003-0721:** Integer signedness error leads to negative array index\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\n**Abstraction:** Pillar\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness covers three distinct situations. A \"missing\" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An \"insufficient\" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an \"ignored\" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nNone\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants of this entry instead.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** The concept of protection mechanisms is well established, but protection mechanism failures have not been studied comprehensively. It is suspected that protection mechanisms can have significantly different types of weaknesses than the weaknesses that they are intended to prevent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\n**Abstraction:** Pillar\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nNone\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.\n**Comments:** Where feasible, consider children or descendants of this entry instead.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-9805:** Chain: Creation of the packet client occurs before initialization is complete (CWE-696) resulting in a read from uninitialized memory (CWE-908), causing memory corruption.\n- **CVE-2014-1266:** chain: incorrect \"goto\" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple \"goto fail\" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).\n- **CVE-2011-1027:** Chain: off-by-one error (CWE-193) leads to infinite loop (CWE-835) using invalid hex-encoded characters.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nWhen an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nauthentification: An alternate term is \"authentification\", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.\nAuthN: \"AuthN\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authentication\" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from \"AuthZ,\" which is an abbreviation of \"authorization.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\nAuthC: \"AuthC\" is used as an abbreviation of \"authentication,\" but it appears to used less frequently than \"AuthN.\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n\n"
