This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSession Riding\nCross Site Reference Forgery\nXSRF\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nRequires -> CWE-346\nRequires -> CWE-441\nRequires -> CWE-642\nRequires -> CWE-613\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine if other weaknesses allow CSRF attacks to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable CSRF tokens might allow bypass of CSRF protection mechanisms; if this occurs, they might be better characterized as randomness/predictability weaknesses.\n**Reasons:**\n- Other\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThere can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.\n\n\n**[Theoretical]** \n\nThe CSRF topology is multi-channel:\n\n\n  - Attacker (as outsider) to intermediary (as user). The interaction point is either an external or internal channel.\n\n  - Intermediary (as user) to server (as victim). The activation point is an internal channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2004-1703:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag\n- **CVE-2004-1995:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag\n- **CVE-2004-1967:** Arbitrary code execution by specifying the code in a crafted img tag or URL\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-842: Placement of User into Incorrect Group\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product or the administrator places a user into an incorrect group.\n\n### Extended Description\nIf the incorrect group has more access or privileges than the intended group, the user might be able to bypass intended security policy to access unexpected resources or perform unexpected actions. The access-control system might not be able to detect malicious usage of this group membership.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-286\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1193:** Operating system assigns user to privileged wheel group, allowing the user to gain root privileges.\n- **CVE-2010-3716:** Chain: drafted web request allows the creation of users with arbitrary group membership.\n- **CVE-2008-5397:** Chain: improper processing of configuration options causes users to contain unintended group memberships.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly protect an assumed-immutable element from being modified by an attacker.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis occurs when a particular input is critical enough to the functioning of the application that it should not be modifiable at all, but it is. Certain resources are often assumed to be immutable when they are not, such as hidden form fields in web applications, cookies, and reverse DNS lookups.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** MAID issues can be primary to many other weaknesses, and they are a major factor in languages that provide easy access to internal program constructs, such as PHP's register_globals and similar features. However, MAID issues can also be resultant from weaknesses that modify internal state; for example, a program might validate some data and store it in memory, but a buffer overflow could overwrite that validated data, leading to a change in program logic.\n\n**[Theoretical]** There are many examples where the MUTABILITY property is a major factor in a vulnerability.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-1757:** Relies on $PHP_SELF variable for authentication.\n- **CVE-2005-1905:** Gain privileges by modifying assumed-immutable code addresses that are accessed by a driver.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n### Extended Description\nWeb applications susceptible to direct request attacks often make the false assumption that such resources can only be reached through a given navigation path and so only apply authorization at certain points in the path.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nforced browsing: The \"forced browsing\" term could be misinterpreted to include weaknesses such as CSRF or XSS, so its use is discouraged.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-862\nChildOf -> CWE-862\nChildOf -> CWE-288\nChildOf -> CWE-424\nCanPrecede -> CWE-471\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Overlaps Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID), authorization errors, container errors; often primary to other weaknesses such as XSS and SQL injection.\n\n**[Theoretical]** \"Forced browsing\" is a step-based manipulation involving the omission of one or more steps, whose order is assumed to be immutable. The application does not verify that the first step was performed successfully before the second step. The consequence is typically \"authentication bypass\" or \"path disclosure,\" although it can be primary to all kinds of weaknesses, especially in languages such as PHP, which allow external modification of assumed-immutable variables.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29238:** Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.\n- **CVE-2022-23607:** Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that \"supercookies\" could be sent to any domain on redirect.\n- **CVE-2004-2144:** Bypass authentication via direct request.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\nWhen access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAssumed-Immutable Parameter Tampering\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-471\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is a primary weakness for many other weaknesses and functional consequences, including XSS, SQL injection, path disclosure, and file inclusion.\n\n**[Theoretical]** This is a technology-specific MAID problem.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-0108:** Forum product allows spoofed messages of other users via hidden form fields for name and e-mail address.\n- **CVE-2000-0253:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n- **CVE-2000-0254:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction:** Compound\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a web server is designed to receive a request from a client without any mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it might be possible for an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSession Riding\nCross Site Reference Forgery\nXSRF\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nRequires -> CWE-346\nRequires -> CWE-441\nRequires -> CWE-642\nRequires -> CWE-613\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine if other weaknesses allow CSRF attacks to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable CSRF tokens might allow bypass of CSRF protection mechanisms; if this occurs, they might be better characterized as randomness/predictability weaknesses.\n**Reasons:**\n- Other\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThere can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.\n\n\n**[Theoretical]** \n\nThe CSRF topology is multi-channel:\n\n\n  - Attacker (as outsider) to intermediary (as user). The interaction point is either an external or internal channel.\n\n  - Intermediary (as user) to server (as victim). The activation point is an internal channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2004-1703:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag\n- **CVE-2004-1995:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag\n- **CVE-2004-1967:** Arbitrary code execution by specifying the code in a crafted img tag or URL\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-842: Placement of User into Incorrect Group\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product or the administrator places a user into an incorrect group.\n\n### Extended Description\nIf the incorrect group has more access or privileges than the intended group, the user might be able to bypass intended security policy to access unexpected resources or perform unexpected actions. The access-control system might not be able to detect malicious usage of this group membership.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-286\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1193:** Operating system assigns user to privileged wheel group, allowing the user to gain root privileges.\n- **CVE-2010-3716:** Chain: drafted web request allows the creation of users with arbitrary group membership.\n- **CVE-2008-5397:** Chain: improper processing of configuration options causes users to contain unintended group memberships.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly protect an assumed-immutable element from being modified by an attacker.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis occurs when a particular input is critical enough to the functioning of the application that it should not be modifiable at all, but it is. Certain resources are often assumed to be immutable when they are not, such as hidden form fields in web applications, cookies, and reverse DNS lookups.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-664\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** MAID issues can be primary to many other weaknesses, and they are a major factor in languages that provide easy access to internal program constructs, such as PHP's register_globals and similar features. However, MAID issues can also be resultant from weaknesses that modify internal state; for example, a program might validate some data and store it in memory, but a buffer overflow could overwrite that validated data, leading to a change in program logic.\n\n**[Theoretical]** There are many examples where the MUTABILITY property is a major factor in a vulnerability.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-1757:** Relies on $PHP_SELF variable for authentication.\n- **CVE-2005-1905:** Gain privileges by modifying assumed-immutable code addresses that are accessed by a driver.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n### Extended Description\nWeb applications susceptible to direct request attacks often make the false assumption that such resources can only be reached through a given navigation path and so only apply authorization at certain points in the path.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nforced browsing: The \"forced browsing\" term could be misinterpreted to include weaknesses such as CSRF or XSS, so its use is discouraged.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-862\nChildOf -> CWE-862\nChildOf -> CWE-288\nChildOf -> CWE-424\nCanPrecede -> CWE-471\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Overlaps Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID), authorization errors, container errors; often primary to other weaknesses such as XSS and SQL injection.\n\n**[Theoretical]** \"Forced browsing\" is a step-based manipulation involving the omission of one or more steps, whose order is assumed to be immutable. The application does not verify that the first step was performed successfully before the second step. The consequence is typically \"authentication bypass\" or \"path disclosure,\" although it can be primary to all kinds of weaknesses, especially in languages such as PHP, which allow external modification of assumed-immutable variables.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29238:** Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.\n- **CVE-2022-23607:** Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that \"supercookies\" could be sent to any domain on redirect.\n- **CVE-2004-2144:** Bypass authentication via direct request.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\nWhen access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information\n- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.\n- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
