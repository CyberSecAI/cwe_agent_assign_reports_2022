This issue affects Apache Kylin 2 version 2.6.6 and prior versions Apache Kylin 3 version 3.1.2 and prior versions Apache Kylin 4 version 4.0.0 and prior versions.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **weakness:** **Cross-origin requests with credentials are allowed from any origin**\n- **product:** Apache Kylin\n- **version:** 2.6.6 and prior versions, 3.1.2 and prior versions, 4.0.0 and prior versions\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-45457:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from an overly broad Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration in Apache Kylin. Specifically, the server reflects the `Origin` header in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header, allowing any origin to make cross-origin requests.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Insecure CORS Configuration:** The server dynamically reflects the `Origin` header value in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response, effectively allowing any website to make cross-origin requests to the Kylin API. This bypasses the intended security of the CORS policy.\n*   **Credentials Allowed Cross-Origin:** The server also sends the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` header, which means that cookies, authorization headers, and TLS client certificates can be included in cross-origin requests. This combined with the overly permissive `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` opens up a significant security hole.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Data Exposure/Manipulation:** An attacker can potentially make cross-origin requests from a malicious website to a vulnerable Kylin instance. If the user has an active Kylin session, the attacker can potentially perform any actions the user is authorized to do. This could include accessing sensitive data, modifying configurations, or even performing administrative tasks on the Kylin platform.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Cross-Site Request:** The attacker would need to trick a user into visiting a malicious webpage or injecting a malicious script into a trusted webpage. This malicious webpage would then make requests to the vulnerable Kylin instance using the logged in users session.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs a user with an active Kylin session to visit a malicious website or have the attacker inject malicious content into a website the victim visits.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Kylin instance.\n*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker also needs knowledge of the Kylin API to construct the requests to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n**Affected Versions:**\n\n*   Apache Kylin 2.x versions up to and including 2.6.6\n*   Apache Kylin 3.x versions up to and including 3.1.2\n*   Apache Kylin 4.x versions up to and including 4.0.0\n\n**Mitigation:**\n\n*   Upgrade to Apache Kylin 3.1.3 (for 2.x and 3.x users) or apply patch <https://github.com/apache/kylin/pull/1782>\n*   Upgrade to Apache Kylin 4.0.1 (for 4.x users) or apply patch <https://github.com/apache/kylin/pull/1781>\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 942 | Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.512 |\n| 2 | 321 | Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.340 |\n| 3 | 923 | Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.339 |\n| 4 | 918 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.317 |\n| 5 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.313 |\n| 6 | 1385 | Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.442 |\n| 7 | 226 | Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 116 | Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.304 |\n| 9 | 346 | Origin Validation Error | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.303 |\n| 10 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.285 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a cross-domain policy file that includes domains that should not be trusted.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA cross-domain policy file (\"crossdomain.xml\" in Flash and \"clientaccesspolicy.xml\" in Silverlight) defines a list of domains from which a server is allowed to make cross-domain requests. When making a cross-domain request, the Flash or Silverlight client will first look for the policy file on the target server. If it is found, and the domain hosting the application is explicitly allowed to make requests, the request is made.\n\n\nTherefore, if a cross-domain policy file includes domains that should not be trusted, such as when using wildcards, then the application could be attacked by these untrusted domains.\n\n\nAn overly permissive policy file allows many of the same attacks seen in Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79). Once the user has executed a malicious Flash or Silverlight application, they are vulnerable to a variety of attacks. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site.\n\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-863\nChildOf -> CWE-923\nChildOf -> CWE-183\nCanPrecede -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2012-2292:** Product has a Silverlight cross-domain policy that does not restrict access to another application, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy.\n- **CVE-2014-2049:** The default Flash Cross Domain policies in a product allows remote attackers to access user files.\n- **CVE-2007-6243:** Chain: Adobe Flash Player does not sufficiently restrict the interpretation and usage of cross-domain policy files, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-domain and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation\n- **CVE-2022-30271:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used by default.\n- **CVE-2020-10884:** WiFi router service has a hard-coded encryption key, allowing root access\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAttackers might be able to spoof the intended endpoint from a different system or process, thus gaining the same level of access as the intended endpoint.\n\n\nWhile this issue frequently involves authentication between network-based clients and servers, other types of communication channels and endpoints can have this weakness.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30319:** S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which can be bypassed by a forged IP address.\n- **CVE-2022-22547:** A troubleshooting tool exposes a web server on a random port between 9000-65535 that could be used for information gathering\n- **CVE-2022-4390:** A WAN interface on a router has firewall restrictions enabled for IPv4, but it does not for IPv6, which is enabled by default\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nXSPA: Cross Site Port Attack\nSSRF: Server-Side Request Forgery\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-441\nChildOf -> CWE-610\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** CWE-918 (SSRF) and CWE-611 (XXE) are closely related, because they both involve web-related technologies and can launch outbound requests to unexpected destinations. However, XXE can be performed client-side, or in other contexts in which the software is not acting directly as a server, so the \"Server\" portion of the SSRF acronym does not necessarily apply.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-32786:** Chain: LLM integration framework has prompt injection (CWE-1427) that allows an attacker to force the service to retrieve data from an arbitrary URL, essentially providing SSRF (CWE-918) and potentially injecting content into downstream tasks.\n- **CVE-2021-26855:** Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in mail server, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-21973:** Server Side Request Forgery in cloud platform, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-209\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-202\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1385: Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a WebSocket, but it does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWebSockets provide a bi-directional low latency communication (near real-time) between a client and a server. WebSockets are different than HTTP in that the connections are long-lived, as the channel will remain open until the client or the server is ready to send the message, whereas in HTTP, once the response occurs (which typically happens immediately), the transaction completes. \n\n\nA WebSocket can leverage the existing HTTP protocol over ports 80 and 443, but it is not limited to HTTP. WebSockets can make cross-origin requests that are not restricted by browser-based protection mechanisms such as the Same Origin Policy (SOP) or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). Without explicit origin validation, this makes CSRF attacks more powerful.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nCross-Site WebSocket hijacking (CSWSH): this term is used for attacks that exploit this weakness\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-346\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-25095:** web console for SIEM product does not check Origin header, allowing Cross Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWH)\n- **CVE-2018-6651:** Chain: gaming client attempts to validate the Origin header, but only uses a substring, allowing Cross-Site WebSocket hijacking by forcing requests from an origin whose hostname is a substring of the valid origin.\n- **CVE-2018-14730:** WebSocket server does not check the origin of requests, allowing attackers to steal developer's code using a ws://127.0.0.1:3123/ connection.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen resources are released, they can be made available for reuse. For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.\n\n\nEven when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.\n\n\nThis weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-459\nChildOf -> CWE-212\nCanPrecede -> CWE-201\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).\n\n**[Maintenance]** This entry needs modification to clarify the differences with CWE-212. The description also combines two problems that are distinct from the CWE research perspective: the inadvertent transfer of information to another sphere, and improper initialization/shutdown. Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.\n\n**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release\n- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.\n- **CVE-2003-0291:** router does not clear information from DHCP packets that have been previously used\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nImproper encoding or escaping can allow attackers to change the commands that are sent to another component, inserting malicious commands instead.\n\n\nMost products follow a certain protocol that uses structured messages for communication between components, such as queries or commands. These structured messages can contain raw data interspersed with metadata or control information. For example, \"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\" is a structured message containing a command (\"GET\") with a single argument (\"/index.html\") and metadata about which protocol version is being used (\"HTTP/1.1\").\n\n\nIf an application uses attacker-supplied inputs to construct a structured message without properly encoding or escaping, then the attacker could insert special characters that will cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the component that receives the output will perform the wrong operations, or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOutput Sanitization\nOutput Validation\nOutput Encoding\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\nCanPrecede -> CWE-74\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness is primary to all weaknesses related to injection (CWE-74) since the inherent nature of injection involves the violation of structured messages.\n\n**[Relationship]** \n\nCWE-116 and CWE-20 have a close association because, depending on the nature of the structured message, proper input validation can indirectly prevent special characters from changing the meaning of a structured message. For example, by validating that a numeric ID field should only contain the 0-9 characters, the programmer effectively prevents injection attacks.\n\n\nHowever, input validation is not always sufficient, especially when less stringent data types must be supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection scenario in which a last name is inserted into a query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\n\n\n**[Terminology]** The usage of the \"encoding\" and \"escaping\" terms varies widely. For example, in some programming languages, the terms are used interchangeably, while other languages provide APIs that use both terms for different tasks. This overlapping usage extends to the Web, such as the \"escape\" JavaScript function whose purpose is stated to be encoding. The concepts of encoding and escaping predate the Web by decades. Given such a context, it is difficult for CWE to adopt a consistent vocabulary that will not be misinterpreted by some constituency.\n\n**[Theoretical]** This is a data/directive boundary error in which data boundaries are not sufficiently enforced before it is sent to a different control sphere.\n\n**[Research Gap]** While many published vulnerabilities are related to insufficient output encoding, there is such an emphasis on input validation as a protection mechanism that the underlying causes are rarely described. Within CVE, the focus is primarily on well-understood issues like cross-site scripting and SQL injection. It is likely that this weakness frequently occurs in custom protocols that support multiple encodings, which are not necessarily detectable with automated techniques.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-41232:** Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)\n- **CVE-2008-4636:** OS command injection in backup software using shell metacharacters in a filename; correct behavior would require that this filename could not be changed.\n- **CVE-2008-0769:** Web application does not set the charset when sending a page to a browser, allowing for XSS exploitation when a browser chooses an unexpected encoding.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry has some significant overlap with other CWE entries and may need some clarification. See terminology notes.\n\n**[Terminology]** The \"Origin Validation Error\" term was originally used in a 1995 thesis [REF-324]. Although not formally defined, an issue is considered to be an origin validation error if either (1) \"an object [accepts] input from an unauthorized subject,\" or (2) \"the system [fails] to properly or completely authenticate a subject.\" A later section says that an origin validation error can occur when the system (1) \"does not properly authenticate a user or process\" or (2) \"does not properly authenticate the shared data or libraries.\" The only example provided in the thesis (covered by OSVDB:57615) involves a setuid program running command-line arguments without dropping privileges. So, this definition (and its examples in the thesis) effectively cover other weaknesses such as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), and CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges). There appears to be little usage of this term today, except in the SecurityFocus vulnerability database, where the term is used for a variety of issues, including web-browser problems that allow violation of the Same Origin Policy and improper validation of the source of an incoming message.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-1218:** DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning\n- **CVE-2005-0877:** DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning\n- **CVE-2001-1452:** DNS server caches glue records received from non-delegated name servers\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n",
