The hierarchical relationships were examined to move from the high-level CWE-284 (Pillar) to more specific Base or Variant level CWEs. The analysis considered alternative classifications offered by peer relationships but focused on direct parent-child relationships to maintain accuracy. Abstraction levels were critical in refining the selection to avoid overly broad classifications.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe749[\"CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe290[\"CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    \n    cwe749 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe290 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe269 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe749,cwe285,cwe287,cwe290,cwe269 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with \"**improper access control**\", leading to a session takeover.\n  - The root cause is the **improper access control**.\n  - The impact is the session takeover.\n  - The attacker gains unauthorized access due to the **improper access control**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitial analysis focused on the \"**improper access control**\" root cause. The evidence comes directly from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section, which highlights \"**improper access control**\" as the root cause.\n\nThe graph relationships guided the decision to consider more specific CWEs related to access control, authorization, and authentication. While the retriever results suggested several candidates, the final selection was based on a balance of specificity and accuracy in representing the weakness described.\n\nCWE-284 is too high-level. More specific CWEs such as CWE-862, CWE-863, CWE-732, CWE-306, CWE-1390, and CWE-923 should be considered. However, there is not enough information to definitively choose a better CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**:

vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product

incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed as the result of a separate weakness that is primary to the authentication error.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**:
