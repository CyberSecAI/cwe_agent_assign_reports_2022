CWE-425 is a child of CWE-862, pointing to a scenario where authorization is missing for direct requests. This hierarchical structure helps to pinpoint the most accurate classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe98[\"CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe425 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe98\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check, which leads to the impact of unauthorized access, specifically through direct requests to restricted resources.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed towards **Improper Authorization**. However, after analyzing the details and specifically the provided \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", it became clear that the root cause is a **missing authorization** check for redirect URLs. This allows for open redirect and potential XSS attacks.\n\nThe evidence supporting this is:\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**:\n    *   **rootcause:** **Improper Authorization**\n    *   **weakness:** **Improper Authorization**\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** The application did not properly sanitize or validate the `redirect` parameter during login, allowing attackers to redirect users to malicious websites after successful login.\n\nThe hierarchical relationships in the CWE structure, especially the parent-child relationship, helped refine the selection from the more general \"Improper Authorization\" (CWE-285) to the more specific \"Missing Authorization\" (CWE-862). The \"Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\" (CWE-425) CWE further clarifies the context, as the vulnerability allows attackers to directly request and access resources without proper authorization.\n\nBased on the evidence, the selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-862 accurately represents the **missing authorization** check, while CWE-425 explains the attack vector.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
