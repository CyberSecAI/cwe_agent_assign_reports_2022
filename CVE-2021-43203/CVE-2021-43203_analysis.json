CWE-358 represents a specific instance where a standardized security check is incorrectly implemented. CWE-304 (Missing Critical Step in Authentication) represents a related authentication failure, which could be a cause of the improper implementation of security checks. CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a more general class of authentication failure, and while related, it's less specific than CWE-358 or CWE-304.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe358[\"CWE-358: Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard\"]\n    cwe304[\"CWE-304: Missing Critical Step in Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe573[\"CWE-573: Missingly Implemented Security Control\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n\n    cwe358 -->|CHILDOF| cwe573\n    cwe358 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe304 -->|CHILDOF| cwe573\n    cwe304 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe358\n    cwe287 -->|PARENT OF| cwe304\n    cwe287 -->|PARENT OF| cwe358\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe358 primary\n    class cwe304,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper nonce verification** during OAuth2. This leads to a **missing or flawed security check** in the authentication process. The potential impact is an **authentication bypass or unauthorized access**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **improper implementation** of nonce verification during OAuth2 authentication. The description explicitly states \"**nonce verification during the OAuth2 authentication process is implemented improperly**.\" This maps directly to CWE-358 (Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard) since nonce verification is a standard security practice in OAuth2. CWE-358 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred.\n\nCWE-304 (Missing Critical Step in Authentication) is considered as a secondary CWE because the **improper implementation** suggests a **missing or flawed step** in the authentication process.\n\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a more general classification. While the vulnerability results in improper authentication, the root cause is more accurately described by the improper implementation of a security check (CWE-358).\n\nI am overriding the recommendation to consider children of CWE-287 because the evidence points to a more specific root cause: the **improperly implemented security check** (CWE-358).\n\nThe retriever results support the selection of CWE-358, CWE-287 and CWE-304.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
