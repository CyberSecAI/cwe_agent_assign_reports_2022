The **improper input sanitization** allows attackers to inject template expressions. |\n| CWE-200 | Information Exposure | 0.7 | Class | Allowed | Secondary CWE.  The **improper input sanitization** results in access to sensitive information. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-1336, which directly addresses the **improper neutralization** of special elements in a template engine. This maps directly to the vulnerability description's mention of **improper input sanitization** and the CVE's explanation of format string injection. The relationship to CWE-200 is that the exploitation of the template injection leads to **information exposure**, making it a secondary impact.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n\n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe1336 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1336 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe94 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper input sanitization** (CWE-1336), leading to the ability to inject malicious code into the template. This results in the execution of unintended code, allowing the attacker to access sensitive information (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis and the provided evidence strongly support the selection of CWE-1336 as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description mentions **improper input sanitization**, and the CVE reference summary describes format string injection. This directly aligns with the CWE-1336 description of **improper neutralization** of special elements in a template engine.\nThe relationship graph emphasizes that CWE-1336 is a specific type of code injection. This makes the selection of CWE-1336 at the optimal level of specificity. The evidence to support this is as follows:\n- \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: **rootcause:** **improper input sanitization**\"\n- \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary: The vulnerability stems from the way the `warnsystem` module formats embed descriptions. Specifically, it uses Python's string formatting (`.format()`) on user-provided input (the warn description template), without proper sanitization. This allows for the injection of malicious code within the format string, leading to remote code execution.\"\n- \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary: Attackers can use the vulnerability to access sensitive information by setting up specific templates. The code is able to access and format attributes of discord objects (like members, roles), making potentially sensitive information available to the attacker.\"\n\nThe retriever results listed several other CWEs, including CWE-201, CWE-863, CWE-184, and CWE-116.\n- CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) was considered as a secondary weakness, but it is an impact of the primary weakness.\n- CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was not selected because the vulnerability does not stem from authorization issues, but rather from **improper input sanitization**.\n- CWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs) was not selected because the vulnerability is not due to an incomplete list of disallowed inputs, but rather from the lack of sanitization of user-provided input.\n- CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) was not selected because the issue is not related to encoding or escaping of output, but rather to the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in a template engine.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
