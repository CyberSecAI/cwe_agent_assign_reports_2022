The vulnerability clearly states that user credentials are stored in plain text. CWE-312 is a child of CWE-311 **Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data**. CWE-522 **Insufficiently Protected Credentials** is a class level CWE and a parent of CWE-256 **Plaintext Storage of a Password**. CWE-256 is more specific than CWE-522 but less specific than CWE-312. The graph helped visualize the relationships and confirm that selecting the most specific CWE was the right decision.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    \n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe256 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  Root Cause: **Improper storage of sensitive information** leading to **cleartext storage of credentials** (CWE-312).\n2.  Impact: A local user can read user credentials in plain text, leading to potential unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards CWE-312 **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly states that user credentials are stored in plain clear text. The retriever results also listed CWE-312 as a top candidate with a high score.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"IBM Tivoli Key Lifecycle Manager ... stores user credentials in plain clear text which can be read by a local user.\"\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary is: \"Password stored in cleartext\" and \"Sensitive information (passwords) are stored in clear text rather than being properly encrypted or hashed.\"\n\nCWE-522 **Insufficiently Protected Credentials** was considered as an alternative but is a class level CWE. While the credentials are insufficiently protected, the root cause is the **cleartext storage**, making CWE-312 a more precise fit.\n\nCWE-256 **Plaintext Storage of a Password** was also considered. This CWE is very similar to CWE-312. The difference is that CWE-256 explicitly refers to passwords whereas CWE-312 refers to sensitive information in general. Since the description refers to user credentials (passwords), CWE-256 could be considered. However, since CWE-312 was a higher retriever score and a more general description of the vulnerability, I chose to use CWE-312 as the primary weakness.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **storage of sensitive information in cleartext** without proper encryption or hashing.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
