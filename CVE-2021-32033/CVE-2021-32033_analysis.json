CWE-337 describes a specific scenario where a PRNG is initialized with a predictable seed like process ID or system time. The vulnerability involves setting the device's time independently of the seed value, allowing prediction of TOTP passwords. Since the time value is predictable, this fits the description of CWE-337. CWE-335, being a more general case of incorrect seed usage, is a secondary consideration. CWE-330 is a higher-level Class and is less specific than CWE-337 and CWE-335.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe337[\"CWE-337: Predictable Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\"]\n    cwe335[\"CWE-335: Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\"]\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n\n    cwe337 -->|CHILDOF| cwe335\n    cwe335 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe337 primary\n    class cwe335,cwe330 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.

The **time value used by the device can be set independently from the used seed value** for generating time-based one-time passwords, without authentication.\"\n\nCWE-337 is the most appropriate because it directly addresses the use of a predictable seed (time) in a PRNG.
