The secondary CWE is CWE-667, also a Class, which describes improper locking. CWE-667 is a child of CWE-662, which deals with improper synchronization. CWE-362 can precede CWE-416 (Use After Free) and CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference), indicating potential follow-on vulnerabilities.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe662[\"CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n\n    cwe362 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    cwe362 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe476\n    cwe667 -->|CHILDOF| cwe662\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe667 secondary\n    class cwe662,cwe416,cwe476 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing lock** (identified in the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases), which leads to a **race condition**. This **race condition** allows a local user to modify the frozen mapped address space.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a **race condition** (CWE-362) due to a **missing lock** (CWE-667) in the Linux kernel's ebpf verifier. The vulnerability allows a local user with special privileges to modify the frozen mapped address space.\n\nThe evidence from the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases confirms the **rootcause** as \"**missing lock**\" and the \"**weakness**\" as \"**race condition**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further supports this by detailing the Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) **race condition** between `bpf_map_update_elem` and `bpf_map_freeze`. The fix involves expanding the use of `map->writecnt` and using atomic operations to prevent **race conditions**, confirming the accuracy of the CWE mapping.\n\nBased on the evidence and the Retriever Results, CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) is the most appropriate primary CWE because it directly describes the core weakness. CWE-667 (Improper Locking) is selected as a secondary CWE since the missing lock is the direct cause of the race condition. While the retriever results contained more specific CWEs like CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition), the description better aligns with a general race condition rather than specifically a TOCTOU.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Justification:** The description aligns directly with the **missing lock** (**rootcause**) described in the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases. The **missing lock** is the reason why the race condition can occur. Since this is a class, it is a secondary candidate. Confidence: 0.7\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Justification:** This CWE accurately captures the **weakness** described as a \"**race condition**\" in the Vulnerability Description and the root cause as a missing lock which leads to a timing window where the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently. Confidence: 0.9\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Justification:** While the CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentions a TOCTOU race condition, the core issue is the general race condition due to the missing lock. Therefore, CWE-362 is a better fit. Confidence: 0.6\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Justification:** There is no mention of double freeing within the description. Confidence: 0.1\n\n## CWE-833: Deadlock\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Justification:** The vulnerability description does not mention a deadlock scenario. The core issue is a **race condition** due to a **missing lock**, not a deadlock. Confidence: 0.1",
