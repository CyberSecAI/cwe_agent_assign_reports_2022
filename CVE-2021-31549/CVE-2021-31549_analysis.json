While CWE-200 broadly covers the exposure of sensitive information, CWE-359 is more specific to the exposure of private personal information, which aligns better with the vulnerability description. CWE-862 is a class-level CWE that broadly describes missing authorization, while more specific base-level CWEs could potentially be considered in the future.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe359 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses starts with the **missing authorization** check on the `SpecialAbuseFilter/examine` form, which leads to the **exposure of suppressed MediaWiki usernames** to unprivileged users.\n  - **Root Cause:** Missing authorization check\n  - **Weakness:** Exposure of sensitive information\n  - **Impact:** Privacy violation\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, I considered CWE-200, Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, but the description specifically mentions the disclosure of suppressed MediaWiki usernames, which falls under private personal information. Therefore, CWE-359, Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor, is a more specific and accurate classification. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"The core weakness is an information leak where suppressed usernames and associated edits could be viewed by unauthorized users via the `Special:AbuseFilter/examine` and `/test` pages\" and \"The system failed to enforce proper visibility checks based on user roles, specifically failing to prevent users without oversight from seeing suppressed content.\" This provides strong evidence for both CWE-359 and CWE-862.\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-359 with a high score, further supporting the choice of this CWE. The description of CWE-359 states: \"The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.\" This aligns directly with the vulnerability, where unprivileged users are accessing suppressed usernames.\n\nCWE-862 was also considered, as the root cause involved **missing authorization** checks on the `SpecialAbuseFilter/examine` form, which allowed unprivileged users to view suppressed usernames. However, the direct impact is the exposure of private information, making CWE-359 the primary weakness. CWE-862 could be seen as a contributing factor but is secondary to the exposure itself.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence and the relationship analysis of the CWEs. CWE-359 is the most specific and accurate classification for this vulnerability, representing the direct exposure of private personal information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context

actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping

CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen trying to keep information confidential, an attacker can often infer some of the information by using statistics.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**:

resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an

being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of

the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe",
