CWE-131, Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size, is included as a contributing factor. CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer. The relationship analysis reveals that an incorrect buffer size calculation (CWE-131) can lead to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe131 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe131 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a crafted file, leading to the execution of `gf_hevc_read_pps_bs_internal` function. The **incorrect calculation of buffer size** (CWE-131) results in a **heap overflow** (CWE-787) during a loop that writes to `pps->column_width`.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary. The key phrases \"heap overflow\" and the description of the loop in `gf_hevc_read_pps_bs_internal` function writing to `pps->column_width` without proper bounds checking strongly suggest CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"In the function gf_hevc_read_pps_bs_internal function in media_tools/av_parsers.c in GPAC 1.0.1 there is a loop, which with crafted file, pps->num_tile_columns may be larger than sizeof(pps->column_width), which results in a **heap overflow** in the loop.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary states:\n- \"The code reads `pps->num_tile_columns` from the bitstream.\"\n- \"It then uses this value in a loop that writes to `pps->column_width`, without proper bounds checking.\"\n- \"If a crafted bitstream provides a value for `pps->num_tile_columns` that is larger than the allocated size of `pps->column_width`, a heap overflow occurs.\"\n\nThe retriever results also suggest CWE-787, though with a lower score. The higher-scoring CWEs like CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) and CWE-191 (Integer Underflow) are less directly relevant, although an integer overflow/underflow could potentially contribute to the incorrect calculation of the buffer size. Given the explicit mention of a heap overflow due to writing beyond the allocated buffer, CWE-787 is the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nCWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) is included as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability involves `pps->num_tile_columns` being larger than `sizeof(pps->column_width)`, implying an incorrect calculation or validation of the buffer size.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, representing the root cause (out-of-bounds write) and a contributing factor (incorrect buffer size calculation).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
