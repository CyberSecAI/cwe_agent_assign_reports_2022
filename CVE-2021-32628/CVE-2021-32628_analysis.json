CWE-789, **Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value** is a child of CWE-770 **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**, which could be triggered by an integer overflow when calculating the size of the memory allocation. The Mermaid diagram illustrates these relationships.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe682[\"CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe190 -->|CHILDOF| cwe682\n    cwe190 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe789\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe789,cwe770,cwe682,cwe20,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) when calculating the size of the ziplist. This can lead to allocating an excessive amount of memory (CWE-789), potentially causing a denial of service or heap corruption, eventually leading to remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-190 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of \"**integer overflow**\" in the vulnerability description and the CVE summary. The \"Retriever Results\" also listed CWE-190 as the top candidate. The description clearly states: \"An **integer overflow** bug in the ziplist data structure used by all versions of Redis can be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution.\" This aligns perfectly with the CWE-190 description. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" further reinforces this by stating: \"Integer overflow in ziplist data structure.\"\n\nCWE-789 was considered as a secondary weakness because the integer overflow can directly result in allocating memory with an excessive size value. The description mentions that the vulnerability involves modifying configuration parameters to a very large value and crafting commands to create very large ziplists. The relationships between these CWEs, particularly the CANPRECEDE relationship between CWE-190 and CWE-789, support this assessment.\n\nThe selection of CWE-190 and CWE-789 is at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-190 is a base-level CWE that accurately describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability. CWE-789 is a variant that describes the allocation of memory with an excessive size value, which is a direct consequence of the **integer overflow**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**CWE-226 was not selected** as the vulnerability does not involve sensitive information being left in the resource but rather the memory allocation being excessive.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**CWE-789 was selected** as a secondary weakness because the integer overflow can directly result in allocating memory with an excessive size value.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**CWE-1289 was not selected** as the vulnerability description mentions that the configuration parameters can be set to a large value and specially crafted commands can be run.
