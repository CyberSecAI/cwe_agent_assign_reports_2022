It is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), which is a more general Class level CWE. The secondary CWE, CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information), is related as the password in the configuration file is stored in cleartext. The relationships influenced the selection by ensuring that the most specific, relevant CWE was chosen (CWE-260), while also acknowledging the broader context of **unencrypted storage** (CWE-312).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe260[\"CWE-260: Password in Configuration File\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe260 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe260 primary\n    class cwe312,cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause**, which is the **unencrypted storage** of passwords in a configuration file. This leads to the **impact** of unauthorized users with access to the file system being able to view the passwords.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-260 (Password in Configuration File)\n  - **Weakness:** CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information)\n  - **Impact:** Unauthorized Access to Passwords\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\". The **weakness** of \"**unencrypted storage**\" and the **impact** of being able to \"view passwords\" directly correlate with CWE-260 and CWE-312 descriptions.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states that the \"Jabber (XMPP) notifier and control Plugin stores passwords unencrypted in the global configuration file `hudson.plugins.jabber.im.transport.JabberPublisher.xml` on the Jenkins controller.\" This confirms the **root cause** as storing passwords in a configuration file and the fact they are **unencrypted** is the **weakness**.\n\nThe graph relationships helped refine the selection by showing that CWE-260 is a child of CWE-522, indicating that CWE-260 is more specific.\n\nCWE-260 is at the optimal level of specificity because it precisely describes the vulnerability: a password stored in a configuration file. CWE-312 further specifies that the password is in cleartext, solidifying the assessment that unauthorized users with file system access can view the passwords.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
