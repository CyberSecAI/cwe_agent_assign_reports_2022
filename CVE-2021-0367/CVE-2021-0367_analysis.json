CWE-787, **Out-of-bounds Write**, is a potential consequence of a **race condition**, where data is written to an incorrect memory location due to unsynchronized access. The relationship is that CWE-362 can precede CWE-787. Both CWE-362 and CWE-787 are child of CWE-119.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe362 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe362 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (CWE-362), leading to **memory corruption** which is represented as an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787). This ultimately leads to a local escalation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-362 as the primary cause, stemming from the explicit mention of a **race condition** in the vulnerability description. This is further supported by the Retriever results, where CWE-362 is the top combined result. The vulnerability description also mentions **memory corruption**, which is often a consequence of **race conditions**, leading to out-of-bounds writes (CWE-787).\n\nThe evidence for CWE-362 is strong due to the direct mention of a **race condition**: \"In vpu, there is a possible **memory corruption** due to a **race condition**.\"\n\nThe relationship between CWE-362 and CWE-787 is that the former can lead to the latter. The mapping guidance for CWE-362 suggests examining its children for a better fit, but none of the children directly address the **race condition** itself. Therefore, CWE-362 is the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nCWE-787 is included as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability description indicates **memory corruption** which could be a result of **out-of-bounds write**. The confidence in this mapping is lower as it is a consequence of the **race condition** rather than the root cause itself.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent both the root cause (**race condition**) and a potential consequence (**memory corruption**/**out-of-bounds write**) of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
