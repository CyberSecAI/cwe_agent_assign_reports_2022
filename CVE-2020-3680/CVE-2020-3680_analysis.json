While CWE-362 is a Class-level CWE, making it generally better to find a child CWE that is either Base or Variant, in this case, no child CWEs are a precise match for the provided vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe1298[\"CWE-1298: Hardware Logic Contains Race Conditions\"]\n    \n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe1298 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe367,cwe1298 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** in the fastrpc memory mapping API, potentially leading to memory corruption or other undefined behaviors due to **improper synchronization** when multiple threads or processes access shared resources concurrently.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is a **race condition** in the fastrpc memory mapping API. The vulnerability description clearly states that a **race condition** can occur when using this API.\nThe Retriever Results strongly suggest CWE-362 as the most relevant CWE, given the direct match of the term \"**Race Condition**\".\nThe evidence is strong, with the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning the **race condition**. The confidence score is high (1.0) because the description aligns directly with the definition of CWE-362.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
