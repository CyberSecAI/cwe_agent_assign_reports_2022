It can also be related to CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity) and CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing), indicating potential overlaps or contributing factors.\nCWE-434 is a peer of CWE-430 (Deployment of Wrong Handler) and CWE-351 (Insufficient Type Distinction).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe358[\"CWE-358: Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard\"]\n    cwe573[\"CWE-573: Improperly Implemented Security Checks\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe290[\"CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\"]\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe430[\"CWE-430: Deployment of Wrong Handler\"]\n    cwe351[\"CWE-351: Insufficient Type Distinction\"]\n\n    cwe358 -->|CHILDOF| cwe573\n    cwe358 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe358 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe345\n    cwe358 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe290\n    cwe434 -- PEEROF --> cwe430\n    cwe434 -- PEEROF --> cwe351\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe358 primary\n    class cwe573,cwe693,cwe345,cwe290,cwe434,cwe430,cwe351 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events for this vulnerability involves an **improperly implemented security check** (CWE-358) leading to a bypass of security measures, which allows an attacker to upload boot project related files. This could also be construed as leading to **unrestricted upload of file with dangerous type** (CWE-434).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment based on the provided evidence points to CWE-358 as the primary weakness. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly states that the root cause is an \"**Improperly Implemented Security Check** (CWE-358)\". This is further supported by the description stating that the CODESYS web server \"fails to properly validate security checks for boot project-related files\" allowing crafted requests to bypass these checks.\n\nThe retriever results also lists CWE-358 as the top combined result.\n\nWhile the end result allows uploading files, the root cause is the **improper security check**. Therefore, CWE-358 is the more accurate and specific classification.\n\nThe relationships also show potential chains, such as CWE-358 potentially leading to insufficient verification or authentication bypass.\n\nCWE-434 is considered as a secondary weakness because the attacker is able to upload a boot project related file from the CODESYS Control runtime system because the security check was **improperly implemented**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-358: Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard**\n    *   The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an \"**Improperly Implemented Security Check**\".\n    *   The CWE description aligns perfectly with the vulnerability, as the CODESYS web server fails to properly validate security checks.\n    *   The suggested usage is \"Allowed,\" and the rationale states that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\n*   **CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type**\n    *   The impact of the vulnerability allows an attacker to \"upload boot project related files\".\n    *   While file upload is a consequence, the root cause is the bypassed security check (CWE-358).\n    *   The suggested usage is \"Allowed,\" and it is at the Base level of abstraction.\n\n*   **CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization**\n    *   CWE-863 was considered because authorization checks are a form of security check.\n    *   However, CWE-358 is more specific because it explicitly refers to the **implementation** of the security check, rather than a general failure of authorization.\n    *   The suggested usage is \"Allowed-with-Review,\" indicating that a more specific CWE might be more appropriate.\n\n*   **CWE-285: Improper Authorization**\n    *   CWE-285 was also considered, but the same logic for CWE-863 applies. The **improper implementation** is the key factor, making CWE-358 a better fit.\n    *   The suggested usage is \"Discouraged,\" further suggesting a more specific alternative.\n\n*   **CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path**\n    *   CWE-73 was considered due to the ability to upload files.\n    *   However, the primary issue is not the external control of the file name or path, but the **bypassed security check** that allows the upload to occur in the first place.\n\nI am confident in this assessment because it is directly supported by the vulnerability description and aligns with the provided root cause analysis. The selection of CWE-358 is at the optimal level of specificity, addressing the underlying **improper implementation** of the security check.",
