# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2020-11547

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Discouraged |
| CWE-807 | Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-200, which is a class-level CWE and a child of CWE-668. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-200 is often misused as a general catch-all. Therefore, a more specific CWE should be considered if possible. Several base-level CWEs were considered, including CWE-807, which was ultimately chosen as a secondary CWE candidate.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events starts with the application **relying on untrusted inputs** in a security decision (CWE-807). This leads to the **exposure of sensitive information** to unauthorized actors (CWE-200).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified CWE-200 as a possible candidate because the vulnerability description states that the application allows remote unauthenticated attackers to **obtain information about probes running or the server itself**. However, CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and is often misused. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states that "The application **fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input** within the 'type' parameter of HTTP requests" - this provides more information about the root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision) captures this root cause.

The final selection is based on the provided evidence, relationship analysis, and mapping guidance. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

### Technical Explanation for CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
*   **How the vulnerability's details match the CWE's characteristics:** The vulnerability allows remote unauthenticated attackers to **obtain information about probes running or the server itself** (CPU usage, memory, Windows version, and internal statistics) via an HTTP request. This aligns with CWE-200, as it directly involves the exposure of sensitive information (system statistics, version details) to an unauthorized actor (remote unauthenticated attackers).
*   **The security implications and potential impact:** The security implication is a loss of confidentiality, potentially leading to further attacks based on the disclosed information (e.g., identifying known vulnerabilities in the disclosed Windows version).
*   **Any parent-child relationships or chain patterns that influenced your mapping:** CWE-200 is a child of CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere), but the description of the vulnerability does not fit CWE-668.
*   **Whether the weakness is primary or secondary in the vulnerability:** This is the primary impact of the vulnerability, but not the root cause.
*   **How the official MITRE mapping guidance influenced your decision:** The mapping guidance for CWE-200 states that it is discouraged and is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As a result, CWE-200 is a reasonable high level assessment, but a root cause should also be included.

### Technical Explanation for CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
*   **How the vulnerability's details match the CWE's characteristics:** The application **fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input** within the 'type' parameter of HTTP requests to /public/login.htm or /index.htm. The application uses the 'type' parameter to determine what information to display. The application is **relying on the input** to make a security decision - what information to provide to the user.
*   **The security implications and potential impact:** The security implication is that an attacker can craft a request with a specific 'type' parameter that leads to the disclosure of sensitive information.
*   **Any parent-child relationships or chain patterns that influenced your mapping:** No relationships influenced the mapping.
*   **Whether the weakness is primary or secondary in the vulnerability:** This is the root cause.
*   **How the official MITRE mapping guidance influenced your decision:** The mapping guidance for CWE-807 states that it is allowed because it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

### Other CWEs Considered but Not Used:
*   **CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function:** While the vulnerability involves unauthenticated access, the core issue is not a complete lack of authentication, but rather **improper handling of inputs** that leads to information disclosure.
*   **CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** SSRF is not applicable here because the application is not making requests to other servers based on user input.
*   **CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** Resource consumption is not the primary issue.
*   **CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal:** Path traversal is not involved in this vulnerability.
*   **CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'):** OS Command Injection is not involved in this vulnerability.
*   **CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs:** While the application could be using a list of disallowed inputs, there is no evidence of this.
*   **CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information:** The vulnerability does not involve cleartext transmission.
*   **CWE-287: Improper Authentication:** While the vulnerability involves unauthenticated access, the core issue is not a complete lack of authentication, but rather **improper handling of inputs** that leads to information disclosure.
*   **CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key:** This vulnerability does not involve cryptographic keys.
