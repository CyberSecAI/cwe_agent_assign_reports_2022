The rendering of visually similar domain names (IDN homographs) due to...\n  3.  **IMPACT:** ...domain spoofing.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that **insufficient data validation in URL formatting** (root cause) leads to domain spoofing through IDN homographs. The core issue is the **insufficient visual distinction of homoglyphs** presented to the user.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Insufficient data validation in URL formatting** in Google Chrome prior to 89.0.4389.72 allowed a remote attacker to perform domain spoofing via IDN homographs via a crafted domain name.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating the root cause as \"**Insufficient data validation in URL formatting**\".\n\nCWE-1007 accurately captures the essence of the vulnerability: \"The product displays information or identifiers to a user, but the display mechanism does not make it easy for the user to distinguish between visually similar or identical glyphs (homoglyphs), which may cause the user to misinterpret a glyph and perform an unintended, insecure action.\"\n\nCWE-451 is a more general class of weakness, and while relevant, CWE-1007 provides a more precise description of the homograph issue. CWE-20 is also relevant as **insufficient data validation** is the root cause, but it doesn't emphasize the user interface misrepresentation aspect.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-1007 is a Base-level CWE, providing a detailed description of the vulnerability. CWE-451 is a Class-level CWE, representing a broader category of UI misrepresentation issues. CWE-20 is a Class-level CWE and represents a more general weakness of improper validation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1007: Insufficient Visual Distinction of Homoglyphs Presented to User\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 7477.82\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product displays information or identifiers to a user, but the display mechanism does not make it easy for the user to distinguish between visually similar or identical glyphs (homoglyphs), which may cause the user to misinterpret a glyph and perform an unintended, insecure action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
