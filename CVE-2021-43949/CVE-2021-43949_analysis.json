It is related to both CWE-639 and CWE-863. CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) is a child of CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), which in turn is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). Thus, there is a hierarchical relationship. While CWE-639 is more specific than CWE-284 and CWE-863, it focuses on authorization bypass through user-controlled keys, which may not be the exact mechanism at play here. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a class-level CWE that represents the vulnerability well but may be too general.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    cwe639 -->|ChildOf| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe639,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **broken access control**, leading to the ability to view private objects.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Broken Access Control** in the Custom Fields feature.\n  - **Impact:** Authenticated remote attackers can view private objects.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates a **broken access control** issue in Atlassian Jira Service Management Server and Data Center. The **root cause** lies in the Custom Fields feature, where access restrictions are not properly enforced, allowing authenticated users to view private objects.\n\nThe primary CWE candidate is CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). Although CWE-284 is discouraged because it is too high-level, I am including it as a primary candidate because the description states that there is a \"Broken Access Control vulnerability\".\n\nCWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) is considered because it involves gaining unauthorized access by manipulating keys, which aligns with the potential mechanism of accessing private objects. However, the description does not explicitly mention user-controlled keys.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is considered because it represents a failure in the authorization check. It is more specific than CWE-284 but less specific than CWE-639.\n\nI am including CWE-284 as the primary candidate CWE because the vulnerability description mentions a \"Broken Access Control vulnerability\". I am also including CWE-639 and CWE-863 as secondary candidates because they are more specific and relevant to the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
