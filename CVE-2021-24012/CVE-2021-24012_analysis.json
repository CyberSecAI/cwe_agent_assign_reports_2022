The other related CWEs are parents (CWE-295) or peers (CWE-297). The parent CWE-295 is more general, while the peer CWE-297 is related to hostname validation. Given that the vulnerability is specifically about the chain of trust and not hostname validation, CWE-296 is the best fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe296[\"CWE-296: Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust\"]\n    cwe295[\"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\"]\n    cwe297[\"CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch\"]\n    \n    cwe296 -->|CHILDOF| cwe295\n    cwe296 --|PEEROF| cwe297\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe296 primary\n    class cwe295,cwe297 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper following of certificates chain of trust** (CWE-296), which leads to the ability to connect to SSLVPN with any certificate signed by a trusted CA.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-296 as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description and the retriever results. The vulnerability description key phrase indicates an **improper following of certificates chain of trust**. The CVE reference links content summary mentions the **root cause** of the vulnerability is an **improper verification of the user certificate's chain of trust** in FortiGate SSL-VPN. Specifically, the system **does not correctly follow the chain of trust of the certificate**, leading to the bypass of proper authentication checks.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-296 as the top result.\n\nBased on the evidence, CWE-296 is the most specific and appropriate CWE. It is a base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
