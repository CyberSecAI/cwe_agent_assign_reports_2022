CWE-256 **Plaintext Storage of a Password** is a child of CWE-522 **Insufficiently Protected Credentials**, and is more specific to passwords. CWE-312 is a child of CWE-311 **Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data** and CWE-922 **Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information** indicating a lack of encryption and insecure storage. Since the **root cause** is the storage in cleartext, CWE-312 is the most appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe922[\"CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe922\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe256,cwe522 secondary\n    class cwe311,cwe922 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the **storage of sensitive data in clear-text**. Because of this, an unauthenticated attacker can remotely query user passwords and obtain user privileges.\n\n`Cleartext Storage -> Remote Query -> Privilege Escalation`\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards CWE-312 **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** as the primary weakness, due to the **root cause** being the **storage of sensitive data in clear-text**. The vulnerability description clearly states that the ECOA BAS controller stores sensitive data (backup exports) in clear-text. The retriever results also list CWE-312 as the top combined result.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section, which explicitly mentions \"**rootcause:** **storage of sensitive data in clear-text**\".\n\nCWE-312 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nStoring a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
