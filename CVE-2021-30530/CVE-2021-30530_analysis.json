CWE-125 (**CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read**) is also a child of CWE-119 and a peer of CWE-787. While CWE-119 is a class-level CWE and discouraged, CWE-787 and CWE-125 are more specific and better represent the vulnerability based on the description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe125,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a crafted HTML page leading to an **out-of-bounds memory access** in the WebAudio component, resulting in a potential **out-of-bounds write**. The chain includes the root cause (**out-of-bounds write**) and potential impact (arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, information disclosure, spoofing, or denial of service).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **out-of-bounds memory access** as the core issue. The retriever results highlighted CWE-787 (**CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write**) and CWE-125 (**CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read**) as potential candidates, with CWE-787 being slightly more relevant. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly states \"root_cause\": \"Out of bounds memory access\" and \"weaknesses\": [\"Out of bounds memory access\"].\n\nGiven the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**Out of bounds memory access**\" and the provided \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" specifies \"Out of bounds memory access\" as the root cause and weaknesses, CWE-787 (**CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write**) is selected as the primary CWE due to its direct relevance to writing outside the intended buffer. CWE-125 (**CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read**) is considered as a secondary candidate since out-of-bounds access could also involve reading. CWE-119 (**CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations**) is considered but classified as secondary because it is a more general class and the description allows for a more specific classification.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity (Base) and are directly supported by the provided evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**:

Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe

children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage:
