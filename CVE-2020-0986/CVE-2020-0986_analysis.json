It is related to CWE-119 **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**, as it is a child of this class-level CWE. It also relates to CWE-123 **Write-what-where Condition**, where the attacker has the ability to write an arbitrary value to an arbitrary location, but is a more specific type of **out-of-bounds write**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe123 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe123 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the Windows kernel **failing to properly handle objects in memory**, which leads to an **out-of-bounds write**, and this in turn leads to an elevation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed to CWE-NVD-noinfo because similar CVE descriptions mapped to it; however, the description contains more specific information about the root cause. The vulnerability description indicates that the Windows kernel **fails to properly handle objects in memory**, leading to an elevation of privilege. This suggests a memory corruption issue. Given the available information, the most appropriate CWE is CWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write**, which describes a scenario where the product writes data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer. This is further supported by the fact that CWE-787 is a top CWE match for similar **Vulnerability Descriptions**.\n\nThe confidence in this assessment is moderate (0.7) because the description is quite general, and it lacks detailed technical information about the specific type of memory corruption. However, the description is more specific than \"no information\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
