CWE-321 directly reflects the **hard-coded key** used, while CWE-522 describes the broader issue of credential protection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe522 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe321\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **hard-coded key** (CWE-321), leading to the insecure storage of credentials and the ability for an attacker to retrieve and decrypt them.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the clear evidence provided in the vulnerability description and CVE reference. The description explicitly states the use of a **hard-coded key**, which aligns directly with CWE-321. The impact of retrieving and decrypting credentials supports the secondary classification of CWE-522.\n\nThe decision to prioritize CWE-321 is based on its direct relevance to the root cause, as highlighted in the \"**rootcause: hard-coded key**\" phrase. The graph relationships emphasize the connection between the specific **hard-coded key** and the broader issue of credential protection.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-321 is a Variant that accurately captures the technical detail of using a **hard-coded cryptographic key**, while CWE-522 is a Class that encompasses the broader context of insufficient credential protection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product violates well-established principles for secure design.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
