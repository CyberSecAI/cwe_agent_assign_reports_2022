It has a ChildOf relationship to CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere). CWE-200 is chosen because the vulnerability description mentions that the application **does not sufficiently protect sensitive data**. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a secondary CWE, with a ChildOf relationship to CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), which is a Pillar. This is selected because the vulnerability requires administrator credentials, suggesting an authorization issue is present, though it's secondary to the data protection issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe668,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the application's **failure to adequately protect sensitive data** when handling API requests. An authenticated remote attacker exploits this by sending a crafted HTTP request. The impact is the attacker obtains sensitive information about the users of the application, including security questions and answers.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the core weakness: **insufficient protection of sensitive data**. The retriever results highlighted CWE-200, CWE-285, CWE-20, and others. While CWE-20 might seem relevant due to the crafted HTTP request, the primary issue is not a failure in input validation but a failure to protect sensitive data. CWE-285 and CWE-863 are relevant as the attacker needs admin credentials.\n\nThe final decision prioritizes CWE-200 as the primary weakness because the vulnerability description explicitly states that the application **does not sufficiently protect sensitive data**. CWE-863 is added as a secondary weakness because admin credentials are required. Both CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the provided evidence. While CWE-200 is generally discouraged, the context explicitly points to a problem with data protection, making it appropriate in this case.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
