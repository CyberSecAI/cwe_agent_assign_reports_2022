CWE-319 is a more specific case of CWE-311, focusing on data in transit. The weakness states that the application **uses less secure methods for protecting data in transit between hosts**, which directly aligns with the description of CWE-319: \"The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\"\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    \n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe327 -->|PEEROF| cwe311\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe311,cwe327 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the **use of less secure methods for data protection** which leads to the potential compromise of data in transit.\n  - **Root Cause:**  **Use of less secure methods for protecting data in transit** (CWE-319 or a related weakness).\n  - **Impact:** Compromise of data at rest and in transit.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly suggests that CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is the most appropriate primary CWE for this vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states that IBM QRadar SIEM **uses less secure methods for protecting data in transit between hosts**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" reinforces this by stating that the **root_cause** is the \"use of less secure methods for protecting data in transit between hosts when encrypt host connections is not enabled as well as data at rest,\" and one of the **weaknesses** is the \"Use of less secure methods for data protection\".\n\nThe selection of CWE-319 is further supported by its Base abstraction level, which is preferred for root cause analysis. The mapping guidance for CWE-319 explicitly allows its usage and states that it is at a preferred level of abstraction.\n\nCWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) was considered but deemed less specific than CWE-319. While the vulnerability involves a lack of adequate encryption, the focus is specifically on data being transmitted in cleartext. The mapping guidance for CWE-311 discourages its use and suggests considering children like CWE-319. CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) was considered because it relates to cryptographic weaknesses, but it doesn't directly address the issue of data being transmitted without encryption. The provided information doesn't explicitly state that a broken algorithm is in use, only that the methods used are \"less secure.\"\n\nTherefore, CWE-319 is the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability, based on the available evidence and MITRE's mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
