CWE-177 and CWE-173 are variants that can lead to path traversal. The vulnerability involves accessing protected resources using encoded path traversal sequences, making CWE-22 the core issue. CWE-177 and CWE-173 represent the specific encoding bypass techniques used.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe177[\"CWE-177: Improper Handling of URL Encoding (Hex Encoding)\"]\n    cwe173[\"CWE-173: Improper Handling of Alternate Encoding\"]\n    cwe172[\"CWE-172: Encoding Error\"]\n\n    cwe177 -->|CHILDOF| cwe172\n    cwe173 -->|CHILDOF| cwe172\n    cwe172 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe22\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe177,cwe173 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses begins with the **improper handling of URL encoding** (potentially CWE-177 or CWE-173), leading to a failure to neutralize path traversal sequences, ultimately resulting in **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory** (CWE-22). This allows attackers to bypass intended restrictions and access sensitive files like web.xml.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-22 because the vulnerability's description explicitly mentions accessing protected resources by bypassing directory restrictions. The vulnerability allows requests with URIs that contain `%2e` or `%2e%2e` segments to access protected resources within the `WEB-INF` directory. The **default compliance mode** allows these requests.\n\nThe following is quoted from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary section:\n```\n{\n  \"cve\": \"CVE-2021-28164\",\n  \"description\": \"The default compliance mode allows requests with URIs that contain `%2e` or `%2e%2e` segments to access protected resources within the `WEB-INF` directory. For example a request to `/context/%2e/WEB-INF/web.xml` can retrieve the `web.xml` file. This can reveal sensitive information regarding the implementation of a web application.\",\n  \"affected_versions\": [\n    \"9.4.37.v20210219\",\n    \"9.4.38.v20210224\"\n  ],\n  \"fixed_versions\": [\n    \"9.4.39\"\n  ],\n  \"vulnerability\": {\n    \"root_cause\": \"A more precise implementation of RFC3986 with regards to URI decoding, together with some new compliance modes, allowed `%2e` or `%2e%2e` characters, which were not assumed by common Servlet implementations, to be excluded for URI normalization. This enabled accessing resources within the WEB-INF directory.\",\n    \"weakness\": [\n      \"CWE-200\",\n      \"CWE-551\"\n    ],\n    \"impact\": \"Disclosure of sensitive information regarding the implementation of a web application by accessing protected resources within the `WEB-INF` directory, for example, retrieving the `web.xml` file.\",\n    \"attack_vector\": \"Network\",\n     \"attacker_capabilities\": \"None\",\n     \"cvss_score\":\"5.3\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCWE-177 (Improper Handling of URL Encoding) and CWE-173 (Improper Handling of Alternate Encoding) were also considered because the attack vector involves URL-encoded characters. However, the core issue is the **failure to properly restrict access to the protected directory**, making CWE-22 the most accurate primary classification. CWE-177 and CWE-173 could be considered secondary because they describe how the path traversal is achieved, but the evidence best supports CWE-22 as the primary weakness.\n\nThe abstraction level of CWE-22 (Base) is appropriate as it directly represents the vulnerability. CWE-177 and CWE-173, being more specific variants, are suitable as secondary classifications to provide more context to the attack.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-177: Improper Handling of URL Encoding (Hex Encoding)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly handle when all or part of an input has been URL encoded.\n\n## CWE-173: Improper Handling of Alternate Encoding\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly handle when an input uses an alternate encoding that is valid for the control sphere to which the input is being sent.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
