# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2020-8639

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-434 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The application allows uploading files without proper checks on the file type, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. |
| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The application does not properly restrict pathnames, allowing the attacker to traverse the file system and upload files to arbitrary locations. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type)**, which allows an attacker to upload a file with an executable extension. This is related to **CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'))** because the vulnerability allows the attacker to control the destination path, thereby bypassing restrictions and enabling the upload of malicious files.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **unrestricted file upload** (**CWE-434**), combined with a **path traversal** vulnerability (**CWE-22**).
  - The attacker uploads a malicious file with an executable extension.
  - The lack of path restriction allows the attacker to place the file in a publicly accessible directory.
  - The ability to upload dangerous file types directly leads to arbitrary code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type)** because the application **fails to properly validate the file type** being uploaded, allowing an attacker to upload a malicious file with an executable extension.

The supporting evidence is: "An **unrestricted file upload** vulnerability in keywordsImport.php in TestLink 1.9.20 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by uploading a file with an executable extension."

The secondary weakness is **CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'))** which stems from the `importType` parameter not being properly sanitized, leading to a path traversal vulnerability. The attacker can control the destination path when uploading a file.

The supporting evidence is: "The `importType` parameter in the `keywordsImport.php` file allows an attacker to control the destination path when uploading a file. By manipulating this parameter, an attacker can specify arbitrary directories on the server to upload files, leading to an unrestricted file upload vulnerability."

The CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause and contributing factors to the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-24: Path Traversal: '../filedir'
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize "../" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-25: Path Traversal: '/../filedir'
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize "/../" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as "/abs/path" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

## CWE-29: Path Traversal: '\..\filename'
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.75

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
