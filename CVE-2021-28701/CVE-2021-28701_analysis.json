While it's generally preferred to map to Base or Variant levels, the evidence strongly supports the presence of a race condition due to **missing enforcement that no parallel request can result in the addition of a mapping**. CWE-362 is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate, but none of the children fit the description. CWE-416 (Use After Free) is a related Variant-level CWE that could result from the race condition; the vulnerability description says that the **impact** is \"guests can retain access to freed and reused pages\".\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n\n    cwe416 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe362\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe416 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing enforcement** that leads to a **race condition**. The **race condition** results in guests retaining access to freed pages, potentially leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-362 as the primary weakness due to the clear evidence of a race condition in the vulnerability description. The description explicitly mentions the **missing enforcement** that allows parallel requests to interfere with memory deallocation, leading to a race condition. The impact of this race condition, as described, is that guests can retain access to freed and reused pages, which aligns with the description of a use-after-free vulnerability (CWE-416).\n\nThe relationship graph highlights that CWE-416 can follow CWE-362, indicating that the race condition can lead to a use-after-free scenario.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-362 as the primary CWE is based on the direct evidence of a race condition. CWE-416 is a secondary CWE since it is the end result of the race condition.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or
