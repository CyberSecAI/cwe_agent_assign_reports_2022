This parent-child relationship indicates that CWE-204 is a more specific case of CWE-203. CWE-1390 is related as a weakness that could potentially lead to similar vulnerabilities, but it is a class and not as specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe204[\"CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe204 -->|CHILDOF| cwe203\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe204 primary\n    class cwe203,cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect** error handling in 389-ds-base. This leads to the disclosure of information about the existence of entries in the LDAP database, which can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards CWE-204 as the primary weakness, given the **observable response discrepancy** that reveals internal state. The vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary provide strong evidence for this.\n\n> The LDAP server was returning specific error messages that revealed information about the existence of entries during the bind operation. Specifically, it was returning 'No such entry' (LDAP_NO_SUCH_OBJECT) if a bind was attempted on a non-existent entry, and 'inappropriate authentication' (LDAP_INAPPROPRIATE_AUTH) if the entry exists, but did not have 'userpassword' set. This allowed unauthenticated users to enumerate existing entries in the directory.\n\nThis evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-204.\n\nCWE-203 was considered as a more general case of **observable discrepancy**, but CWE-204 provides a more precise description of the vulnerability.\nCWE-1390 was considered because the vulnerability is related to authentication, but the root cause is more about the **information disclosure** via error messages rather than a fundamentally **weak authentication** mechanism.\n\nTherefore, CWE-204 is the most appropriate and specific choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n### Technical Explanation for CWE-204:\n\n*   How the vulnerability's details match the CWE's characteristics: The 389-ds-base server responds differently depending on whether a DN exists, revealing internal state (existence of the entry) to an unauthenticated attacker.\n*   The security implications and potential impact: An attacker can enumerate valid DNs without authentication, which can be used for further attacks.\n*   Any parent-child relationships or chain patterns that influenced your mapping: CWE-204 is a child of CWE-203, indicating a more specific type of observable discrepancy.\n*   Whether the weakness is primary or secondary in the vulnerability: This is the primary weakness.\n*   How the official MITRE mapping guidance influenced your decision: The usage is ALLOWED and the abstraction level is Base, which is preferred.\n\n### Technical Explanation for CWE-203:\n\n*   How the vulnerability's details match the CWE's characteristics: The 389-ds-base server exhibits different behavior depending on the existence of a DN.\n*   The security implications and potential impact: Information disclosure about the LDAP database structure.\n*   Any parent-child relationships or chain patterns that influenced your mapping: CWE-204 is a more specific child of this CWE.\n*   Whether the weakness is primary or secondary in the vulnerability: This is a secondary, more general weakness.\n*   How the official MITRE mapping guidance influenced your decision: The usage is ALLOWED and the abstraction level is Base, which is preferred.\n\n### Technical Explanation for CWE-1390:\n\n*   How the vulnerability's details match the CWE's characteristics: The authentication mechanism reveals information that it should not.\n*   The security implications and potential impact: Potential for bypassing authentication or gaining unauthorized access.\n*   Any parent-child relationships or chain patterns that influenced your mapping: Not directly part of a clear chain in this case.\n*   Whether the weakness is primary or secondary in the vulnerability: This is a secondary weakness.\n*   How the official MITRE mapping guidance influenced your decision: Usage is Allowed-with-Review, suggesting a need for careful consideration.\n\n### CWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-90 (LDAP Injection): Not applicable because there is no indication of improper neutralization of special elements in an LDAP query.
