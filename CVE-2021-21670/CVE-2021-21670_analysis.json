Its parent is CWE-285 **Improper Authorization**, which is more general. CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** is a peer and an alternative if authorization exists but is flawed. The evidence points to the absence of authorization checks for users with `Item/Cancel` permissions who lack `Item/Read` permissions making CWE-862 the more appropriate choice. Both are Class level, so the best fit is the one that describes the vulnerability directly.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 --|PEEROF| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862) - The system **fails to check** if a user with `Item/Cancel` permission also has `Item/Read` permission.\n2.  **Weakness:** Users with only `Item/Cancel` permission can perform actions they should not be authorized to do (cancel queue items and abort builds).\n3.  **Impact:** Denial of Service - Users can disrupt build processes by canceling or aborting jobs.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, both CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** and CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** seemed applicable. However, a closer look at the vulnerability description and the provided information shows that the issue is not an incorrect authorization check but rather the **absence of a necessary authorization check**. Specifically, the system **does not properly check** whether a user with `Item/Cancel` permission also has the required `Item/Read` permission to perform the action. Therefore, CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** is the more accurate and specific classification.\n\nThe evidence to support this is the following from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section:\n\n*   \"The vulnerability stems from improper permission checks within Jenkins. Specifically, users with `Item/Cancel` permission could cancel queue items and abort builds even if they lacked `Item/Read` permission.\"\n*   \"The core weakness is that the system didn't correctly enforce the requirement for `Item/Read` permission alongside `Item/Cancel` when performing cancel/abort operations.\"\n\nThese statements indicate that the system is **missing** a required authorization check, which aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-862. The suggested fix of requiring `Item/Read` permission in addition to `Item/Cancel` further reinforces this conclusion.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **missing authorization** check. While CWE-285 **Improper Authorization** is a parent class, it is too general and encompasses both **missing** and **incorrect** authorization, making CWE-862 the more precise choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used:** This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is related to authorization, not storage of sensitive information.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used:** This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is related to authorization, not the insertion of sensitive information into files or directories.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used:** This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is related to authorization, not cleartext transmission of data.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used:** This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is related to authorization, not the improper removal of sensitive information.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
