# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2021-21670

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE considered is CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**. Its parent is CWE-285 **Improper Authorization**, which is more general. CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** is a peer and an alternative if authorization exists but is flawed. The evidence points to the absence of authorization checks for users with `Item/Cancel` permissions who lack `Item/Read` permissions making CWE-862 the more appropriate choice. Both are Class level, so the best fit is the one that describes the vulnerability directly.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is as follows:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862) - The system **fails to check** if a user with `Item/Cancel` permission also has `Item/Read` permission.
2.  **Weakness:** Users with only `Item/Cancel` permission can perform actions they should not be authorized to do (cancel queue items and abort builds).
3.  **Impact:** Denial of Service - Users can disrupt build processes by canceling or aborting jobs.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, both CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** and CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** seemed applicable. However, a closer look at the vulnerability description and the provided information shows that the issue is not an incorrect authorization check but rather the **absence of a necessary authorization check**. Specifically, the system **does not properly check** whether a user with `Item/Cancel` permission also has the required `Item/Read` permission to perform the action. Therefore, CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** is the more accurate and specific classification.

The evidence to support this is the following from the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section:

*   "The vulnerability stems from improper permission checks within Jenkins. Specifically, users with `Item/Cancel` permission could cancel queue items and abort builds even if they lacked `Item/Read` permission."
*   "The core weakness is that the system didn't correctly enforce the requirement for `Item/Read` permission alongside `Item/Cancel` when performing cancel/abort operations."

These statements indicate that the system is **missing** a required authorization check, which aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-862. The suggested fix of requiring `Item/Read` permission in addition to `Item/Cancel` further reinforces this conclusion.

The selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **missing authorization** check. While CWE-285 **Improper Authorization** is a parent class, it is too general and encompasses both **missing** and **incorrect** authorization, making CWE-862 the more precise choice.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Used:** This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is related to authorization, not storage of sensitive information.

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Used:** This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is related to authorization, not the insertion of sensitive information into files or directories.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Used:** This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is related to authorization, not cleartext transmission of data.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Used:** This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is related to authorization, not the improper removal of sensitive information.

## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

**Why Not Used:** This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is related to authorization, not the missing encryption of data.

## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

**Why Not Used:** This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is related to authorization, not the protection of credentials.

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Used:** This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is related to authorization, not the exposure of sensitive system information.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

**Why Not Used:** While this CWE is somewhat related to access control issues, it is too broad and less specific than CWE-862.
