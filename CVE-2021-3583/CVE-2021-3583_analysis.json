Additionally, CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) is related as the mechanism enabling the injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: OS Command Injection\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Command Injection\"]\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe1336\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe1336 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** in the **template engine**, leading to template injection, and ultimately resulting in OS command injection.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified that the vulnerability involves **command injection** due to a flaw in Ansible's users controller, specifically related to template injection. The analysis of the vulnerability description and the provided \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" indicates that the root cause is insufficient sanitization of user-controlled data (facts) when used in multi-line YAML strings. This allows attackers to perform command injection, disclosing sensitive information.\n\nThe \"Retriever Results\" further support this assessment, with CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')) and CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) being the top candidates. The evidence from the vulnerability description key phrases indicates \"command injection\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" indicates the root cause is \"Template injection vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled data (facts) when used in multi-line YAML strings.\"\n\nGiven the specific context of OS command execution, CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) is chosen as the primary CWE. The vulnerability allows attackers to inject OS commands, aligning directly with the description of CWE-78. The relationship between CWE-77 and CWE-78, where CWE-78 is a specific type of command injection, supports this decision.\n\nCWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) is included as a secondary CWE because the **template injection** mechanism is the root cause that allows the attacker to inject commands.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause (template injection) and the resulting impact (OS command injection).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
