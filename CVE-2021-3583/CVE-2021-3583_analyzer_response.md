# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2021-3583

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability allows attackers to perform **command injection** by exploiting template injection. |
| CWE-1336 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE: The root cause is **template injection** because of the insufficient sanitization of user-controlled data (facts) when used in multi-line YAML strings. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the hierarchical connection between CWE-77 (Command Injection) and CWE-78 (OS Command Injection), where CWE-78 is a specific type of command injection. Additionally, CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) is related as the mechanism enabling the injection.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** in the **template engine**, leading to template injection, and ultimately resulting in OS command injection.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified that the vulnerability involves **command injection** due to a flaw in Ansible's users controller, specifically related to template injection. The analysis of the vulnerability description and the provided "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" indicates that the root cause is insufficient sanitization of user-controlled data (facts) when used in multi-line YAML strings. This allows attackers to perform command injection, disclosing sensitive information.

The "Retriever Results" further support this assessment, with CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')) and CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) being the top candidates. The evidence from the vulnerability description key phrases indicates "command injection" and the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" indicates the root cause is "Template injection vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled data (facts) when used in multi-line YAML strings."

Given the specific context of OS command execution, CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) is chosen as the primary CWE. The vulnerability allows attackers to inject OS commands, aligning directly with the description of CWE-78. The relationship between CWE-77 and CWE-78, where CWE-78 is a specific type of command injection, supports this decision.

CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) is included as a secondary CWE because the **template injection** mechanism is the root cause that allows the attacker to inject commands.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause (template injection) and the resulting impact (OS command injection).

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.
