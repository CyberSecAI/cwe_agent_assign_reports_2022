CWE-90 is a child of CWE-943 (Improper Neutralization Across a Trust Boundary) and has a direct relationship to the vulnerability described. CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) was considered due to its relation to security mechanisms, but is a class level of abstraction and is discouraged. CWE-90 is the more specific and relevant base level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe90[\"CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization Across a Trust Boundary\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe90 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe90 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the **LDAP injection** (**CWE-90**), which allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform actions such as retrieving password hashes or session tokens. The root cause is the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an LDAP query. The impact is unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is **LDAP injection**. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"LDAP injection\" as the weakness. The retriever results also prioritize **CWE-90 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection'))** as the most relevant CWE.\n\nThe decision to assign CWE-90 as the primary CWE is based on the explicit mention of \"LDAP injection\" in the vulnerability description and the high relevance score from the retriever results. The supporting evidence is the vulnerability description key phrase: \"**weakness:** **LDAP injection**\". While the provided \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" is unrelated, the vulnerability description itself provides sufficient evidence for the CWE assignment.\n\nCWE-287 was considered, but it is a class-level CWE and is discouraged when more specific CWEs are available. CWE-90 is a base-level CWE that directly addresses the identified weakness, making it the optimal choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be

abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**:

root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe

Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5077.07\n**Source**:
