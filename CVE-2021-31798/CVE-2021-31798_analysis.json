Several related weaknesses exist: the use of default cryptographic keys, the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys, and the use of risky cryptographic implementations.\nCWE-331 (Insufficient Entropy) is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values), which in turn is a child of CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure). It's important to select the most specific CWE that accurately represents the vulnerability, hence choosing CWE-331 over its parents.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe331[\"CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy\"]\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    cwe1394[\"CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n    \n    cwe331 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n    cwe330 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe331 primary\n    class cwe330,cwe693,cwe1394,cwe321,cwe1240 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient entropy** used in the key derivation process. This leads to a **weak key space**, making brute-force attacks feasible. The attacker can then decrypt the local cache files, gaining access to sensitive information such as passwords and application properties.\n\nCWE-331 (Insufficient Entropy) -> Weak Key Space -> Decryption of Cache Files -> Access to Sensitive Information\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The vulnerability is due to **insufficient entropy** used in the key derivation process for encrypting the cache in CyberArk Credential Provider. The effective key space is reduced, making brute-force attacks feasible, which allows a local malicious user to obtain the plaintext of cache files.\n\nThe CVE reference links state: \"The vulnerability stems from a **weakness** in the key derivation process for the local cache encryption... Due to a **lack of sufficient entropy** in the username and the limited number of application types, the effective key space is drastically reduced, making brute-force attacks feasible.\"\n\nThe retriever results also support this assessment, with CWE-331 (Insufficient Entropy) being the top match.\nCWE-331 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.\nOther CWEs considered but not selected as primary:\n- CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm): While this is related, the root cause is specifically the insufficient entropy rather than a fundamentally broken algorithm.\n- CWE-1394 (Use of Default Cryptographic Key): This may be a contributing factor if default values are used, but the primary issue is the entropy of the key derivation process itself.\n- CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key): Similar to default keys, this is not the primary issue but a potential contributing factor if hard-coded values are used in the key derivation.\n- CWE-1240 (Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation): Could be applicable if the SHA1 hash is considered risky.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear understanding of the root cause and contributing factors to the vulnerability.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm or scheme that produces insufficient entropy, leaving patterns or clusters of values that are more likely to occur than others.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
