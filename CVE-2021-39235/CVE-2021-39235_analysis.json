This indicates that the authorization mechanism is present, but it's implemented incorrectly. Choosing CWE-863 provides a more specific classification than its parent. No chain relationships appear directly relevant in this case.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect authorization** mechanism in the Ozone Datanode. Specifically, the datanode **does not check the access mode parameter** of the block token. This leads to a situation where an authenticated user with a READ block token can perform write operations, resulting in potential data corruption or unauthorized modifications.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **lack of access mode validation** as the root cause, leading to **incorrect authorization**. The vulnerability description clearly states that \"Ozone Datanode doesnt check the access mode parameter of the block token,\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the root cause is the **lack of access mode validation on block tokens**. Because the authorization check is present, but incorrect, CWE-863 is the best selection.\n\nCWE-285 was considered but not chosen as the primary because it is a higher-level class that encompasses both missing and incorrect authorization, while CWE-863 specifically addresses the case of incorrect authorization.\nThe selection of CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the vulnerability's root cause: an existing authorization check is implemented incorrectly, allowing unauthorized write operations.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25

product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
