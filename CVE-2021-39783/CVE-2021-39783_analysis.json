It has hierarchical relationships with CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Access Control Problems). CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) is a Class-level CWE that is related to CWE-285 and CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Access Control Problems\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe732 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing permission check** (CWE-862), leading to the ability to modify TTY mode, resulting in a local escalation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified that the **root cause** of the vulnerability is a **missing permission check**. The primary CWE selected is CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), which aligns with the **root cause**. The vulnerability description states there is a **\"missing permission check\"** which allows unauthorized modification of the TTY mode. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that the vulnerability is an \"Elevation of Privilege\" due to an unspecified weakness.\n\nCWE-862 accurately describes the vulnerability: \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\" This aligns directly with the **missing permission check** described in the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) was considered because it also deals with permissions. However, the description emphasizes **\"incorrect permission assignment\"**, whereas the identified issue is a complete lack of permission checks. While CWE-732 could potentially apply, CWE-862 is a more direct and accurate representation of the **root cause**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the appropriate level of specificity (Class). While children of CWE-862 may exist, the available information does not provide enough detail to determine if a more specific CWE would be appropriate. Therefore, selecting the Class-level CWE is the most appropriate choice based on the evidence. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-862 suggests reviewing children for a better fit, however, based on the available information, CWE-862 is the most accurate.",
