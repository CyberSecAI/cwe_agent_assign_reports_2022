The vulnerability description clearly indicates an **LDAP injection** issue due to **improper neutralization** of special elements within an LDAP query. This aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-90, a Base level CWE. While CWE-116, **Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output**, is also relevant, it's a class level CWE and represents a more general case of the root cause. The relationship between CWE-116 and CWE-90 is that improper encoding can lead to LDAP injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe90[\"CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization Across a Trust Boundary\"]\n\n    cwe90 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n    cwe116 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe90\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe90 primary\n    class cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper encoding/escaping** of the username (CWE-116), which leads to the **LDAP Injection** vulnerability (CWE-90). The impact of the LDAP injection is the potential to read, modify, or delete sensitive information from the directory service.\n  - Root Cause: **Improper encoding/escaping** of username (CWE-116).\n  - Weakness: **LDAP Injection** (CWE-90) due to missing sanitization of user-provided input in LDAP queries.\n  - Impact: Ability to read, modify, or delete sensitive information from the LDAP directory service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description key phrases include \"**LDAP injection**\" which strongly suggests CWE-90. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is the construction of LDAP search filters using user-provided input without proper sanitization. The application directly incorporates the username into the LDAP filter string, creating an **LDAP Injection** vulnerability (CWE-90).\n\nThe retriever results also strongly support CWE-90 as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-116 was considered because **improper encoding** is a common cause of injection vulnerabilities. However, CWE-90 is a more specific description of the actual vulnerability, representing the specific type of injection occurring.\n\nThe selection of CWE-90 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it precisely describes the vulnerability and is a Base level CWE. The mapping guidance for CWE-90 explicitly allows its usage and states that it is at a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\nThe evidence is: \"The provided username is not properly escaped.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an LDAP query using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended LDAP query when it is sent to a downstream component.",
