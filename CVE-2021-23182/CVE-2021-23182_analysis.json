CWE-316 is a Variant of CWE-312, providing a more specific classification. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information **in Memory**,\" which aligns perfectly with CWE-316.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe316[\"CWE-316: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe922[\"CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe316 -->|CHILDOF| cwe312\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe922\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe316 primary\n    class cwe312,cwe922 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **cleartext storage of sensitive information** (OSDP reader master keys) in memory. This leads to the **impact** of the sensitive information being discoverable in server memory dumps. An attacker who gains access to a memory dump could extract the keys and use them for unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis clearly pointed towards CWE-316 as the most appropriate classification, as it directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the **cleartext storage of sensitive information in memory**. This assessment is strongly based on the provided evidence, specifically:\n\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** \"**rootcause:** **cleartext storage of sensitive information**\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"Cleartext storage of sensitive information **in memory**. Specifically, OSDP reader master keys are stored in cleartext in the memory of the Gallagher Command Centre Server.\"\n\nThe hierarchical relationship between CWE-316 and CWE-312 further supports this decision, as CWE-316 provides a more specific classification for the vulnerability. The selection of CWE-316 is at the optimal level of specificity because it precisely captures the weakness described in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
