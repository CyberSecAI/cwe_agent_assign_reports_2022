## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-307 Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts, which is a child of CWE-1390 Weak Authentication and CWE-287 Improper Authentication. This indicates a weakness in how the system handles multiple authentication attempts. CWE-6 J2EE Misconfiguration: Insufficient Session-ID Length is a variant of CWE-334, which is related to predictable or weak session IDs. CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values can lead to weak session IDs, and is a parent of CWE-338 Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **weak session ID** generation (potentially due to CWE-330), leading to an insufficient session ID length (CWE-6). This makes the system vulnerable to brute-force attacks because the attacker can try multiple session IDs. The **improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts** (CWE-307) then allows an attacker to try many session IDs without being blocked, eventually leading to an authentication bypass and unauthorized access.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on the **weakness** related to the easily brute-forceable session ID. The Retriever results pointed to several relevant CWEs including CWE-307, CWE-1391, and CWE-6. Based on the vulnerability description and the provided CVE Reference Links Content Summary, the core issue is that the system allows for brute-force attacks due to the short session ID and lack of rate limiting, meaning the system does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts within a short time frame. This aligns directly with CWE-307, "Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts".

The vulnerability description states: "EyesOfNetwork 5.3-10 uses an **integer of between 8 and 10 digits for the session ID**, which might be leveraged for brute-force authentication bypass". Also from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, "Session ID Brute-Forcing: The session ID generation is weak (8-10 digits) making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks". This indicates that the system does not prevent attackers from making multiple authentication attempts.

CWE-6, "J2EE Misconfiguration: Insufficient Session-ID Length" is also considered because the session ID length is insufficient, contributing to the ease of brute-forcing. However, the primary issue is the lack of rate limiting, making CWE-307 the primary weakness. CWE-330, "Use of Insufficiently Random Values" is considered a possible root cause for the weak session ID generation, but there's no direct evidence to confirm this. Thus, it's a secondary consideration.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause and contributing factors of the vulnerability. CWE-307 accurately describes the lack of rate limiting on authentication attempts. CWE-6 highlights the insufficient session ID length, and CWE-330 identifies the possibility of insufficient randomness in session ID generation.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-27514

## Vulnerability Description
EyesOfNetwork 5.3-10 uses an **integer of between 8 and 10 digits for the session ID**, which might be leveraged for brute-force authentication bypass (such as in CVE-2021-27513 exploitation).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **integer of between 8 and 10 digits for the session ID**
- **impact:** brute-force authentication bypass
- **product:** EyesOfNetwork
- **version:** 5.3-10

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27514:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient file extension validation within the `admin_ITSM` module of the affected application. This allows an attacker to bypass client-side filtering and upload arbitrary file types, including malicious PHP scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Upload:** The application fails to properly validate file extensions on the server-side, relying solely on client-side checks.
*   **Missing Server-Side Validation:** Lack of proper sanitization of the file name or type before upload.
*   **Session ID Brute-Forcing:**  The session ID generation is weak (8-10 digits) making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks, as highlighted in the provided script.
*   **Unauthenticated RCE:** By combining the session brute force and arbitrary file upload it's possible to gain RCE without authentication

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker can upload malicious files (e.g., PHP web shells) to the server.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  By uploading and accessing a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Full server compromise:** The attacker can potentially use the access to pivot to the LAN and compromise other resources

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Session ID Brute-forcing**: The attacker attempts to brute-force a valid session ID.
2.  **Intercept and modify file upload request**: The attacker intercepts the file upload request and changes the file extension to a malicious one (e.g., .php).
3.  **Upload malicious file**: The attacker uploads the malicious file via the vulnerable admin\_ITSM module.
4.  **Trigger execution**: The attacker sends a GET request to execute the uploaded PHP reverse shell.
5.  **Gain shell**: Once executed, the attacker gains a reverse shell on the target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application server.
*   **Ability to Intercept and Modify Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests to bypass client-side checks.
*   **Basic knowledge of HTTP**: The attacker needs a basic understanding of how HTTP request work.
*   **Ability to start a listener**: The attacker needs to set up a listener to get the reverse shell.
*   **Knowledge of the target application:** Some knowledge of the application (to know where to send the requests, session ID format, etc) is required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit script (`PoC-BruteForceID-arbitraty-file-upload-RCE-PrivEsc.py`) demonstrates the full attack chain, including session ID brute-forcing, arbitrary file upload, and remote code execution.
*   The issue was initially reported on Feb 21, 2021, and a fix was committed on Feb 23, 2021, to address the file extension validation and session handling, but session ID were still weak.
*   The exploit targets version 5.3-10 of the affected application.
*   The session IDs are described to be 8 to 10 digits which makes them very easy to brute force.

- **CVE-2001-1291:** Product does not disconnect or timeout after multiple failed logins.




## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

### Extended Description


By design, authentication protocols try to ensure that attackers must perform brute force attacks if they do not know the credentials such as a key or password. However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.


Credentials may be weak for different reasons, such as:


  - Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)

  - Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)

  - Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be guessed with reasonable efficiency)

Even if a new, unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.

- **CVE-2008-3662:** A product does not set the secure flag for the session cookie in an https session, which can cause the cookie to be sent in http requests and make it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie.




## CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in a security context, but the PRNG's algorithm is not cryptographically strong.

### Extended Description


When a non-cryptographic PRNG is used in a cryptographic context, it can expose the cryptography to certain types of attacks.


Often a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is not designed for cryptography. Sometimes a mediocre source of randomness is sufficient or preferable for algorithms that use random numbers. Weak generators generally take less processing power and/or do not use the precious, finite, entropy sources on a system. While such PRNGs might have very useful features, these same features could be used to break the cryptography.


### Alternative Terms

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-330
ChildOf -> CWE-330

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-3692:** PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens
- **CVE-2009-3278:** Crypto product uses rand() library function to generate a recovery key, making it easier to conduct brute force attacks.
- **CVE-2009-3238:** Random number generator can repeatedly generate the same value.




## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

### Extended Description


Attackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less effort than expected.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)




## CWE-6: J2EE Misconfiguration: Insufficient Session-ID Length
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The J2EE application is configured to use an insufficient session ID length.

### Extended Description
If an attacker can guess or steal a session ID, then they may be able to take over the user's session (called session hijacking). The number of possible session IDs increases with increased session ID length, making it more difficult to guess or steal a session ID.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-334

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use






## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
According to WASC, "Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization."

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-672
ChildOf -> CWE-672
CanPrecede -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.






## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).




## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

### Extended Description
When product generates predictable values in a context requiring unpredictability, it may be possible for an attacker to guess the next value that will be generated, and use this guess to impersonate another user or access sensitive information.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-693
CanPrecede -> CWE-804

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be primary to many other weaknesses such as cryptographic errors, authentication errors, symlink following, information leaks, and others.

**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.3, CWE-330 and its descendants are being investigated by the CWE crypto team to identify gaps related to randomness and unpredictability, as well as the relationships between randomness and cryptographic primitives. This "subtree analysis" might result in the addition or deprecation of existing entries; the reorganization of relationships in some views, e.g. the research view (CWE-1000); more consistent use of terminology; and/or significant modifications to related entries.

**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-3692:** PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens
- **CVE-2020-7010:** Cloud application on Kubernetes generates passwords using a weak random number generator based on deployment time.
- **CVE-2009-3278:** Crypto product uses rand() library function to generate a recovery key, making it easier to conduct brute force attacks.




## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.

### Extended Description
When a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which "permissions" are not checked, which is an "authorization" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure "Everyone: Full Control" permissions for files under the "Program Files" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.
- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.
