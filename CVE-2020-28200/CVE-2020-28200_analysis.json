CWE-1333 is a child of CWE-407 (Uncontrolled Computation). CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a Class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-1333, but it is too general. CWE-1333 is more specific, as the vulnerability is caused by an inefficient regular expression.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Uncontrolled Computation\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the use of a complex regular expression, leading to inefficient computation and ultimately resulting in uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** as a key phrase. The vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicate that the **weakness** lies in the lack of control over resource consumption due to a complex regular expression. The retriever results point to CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity) and CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) as potential candidates.\n\nCWE-400 is a Class-level CWE and is discouraged for direct mapping due to its generality. CWE-1333 is a Base-level CWE that specifically addresses the use of inefficient regular expressions, which aligns perfectly with the vulnerability's root cause.\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly states that \"The Sieve interpreter lacks protection against abusive scripts, particularly those using excessive regular expressions.\" This statement directly supports the selection of CWE-1333.\n\nTherefore, CWE-1333 is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability, as it accurately captures the root cause of the issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n-
