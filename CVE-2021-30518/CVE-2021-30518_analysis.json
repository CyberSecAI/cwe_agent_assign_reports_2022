Also, CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a variant of CWE-787, further specifying the location of the buffer. The selection favors the most specific base CWE, CWE-787, but acknowledges the relevance of the variant CWE-122.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **heap buffer overflow** due to a crafted HTML page, leading to heap corruption.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Heap buffer overflow** (CWE-787)\n  - **Impact:** Heap corruption\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The key phrase \"Heap buffer overflow\" from the vulnerability description directly supports the selection of CWE-787 as the primary CWE. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms the **root_cause** and **vulnerability** is a \"**Heap buffer overflow**\". The graph relationships show that CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119, which is a more general class of vulnerability. Since the provided information is specific to a heap buffer overflow, CWE-787 is the more appropriate choice.\n\nCWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) was considered but not chosen as the primary CWE because CWE-787 more directly captures the **out-of-bounds write** condition, while CWE-122 describes the location (heap) of the overflow, which is secondary to the actual weakness.\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) was considered but not chosen because it's a high-level class, and the description clearly indicates an **out-of-bounds write**, making CWE-787 a better fit. The mapping guidance for CWE-119 discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nCWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound), CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')), CWE-416 (Use After Free), CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read), CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')), CWE-366 (Race Condition within a Thread), CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error), and CWE-415 (Double Free) were considered but deemed less relevant as they do not directly address the **heap buffer overflow** condition described in the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the **root cause** of the vulnerability based on the available evidence.",
