CWE-193 is a child of CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation). CWE-193 can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-788 (Access of Memory Location After the End of Buffer). CWE-119 is a class-level CWE, and the guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. Since we have evidence of an off-by-one error that leads to a heap-based buffer overflow, we can map to CWE-193 and CWE-122 respectively.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe193[\"CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\"]\n    cwe682[\"CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe788[\"CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After the End of Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe193 -->|CHILDOF| cwe682\n    cwe193 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe193 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n    class cwe119,cwe682,cwe787,cwe788 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **off-by-one error** (CWE-193) in the buffer allocation size, which leads to a **heap-based buffer overflow** (CWE-122) when parsing JSON strings. This overflow can potentially cause memory corruption and redirection of control flow.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment based on the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** identified the \"**off-by-one heap-based buffer overflow**\" as a key weakness. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** provides more detailed evidence: \"The vulnerability stems from an incorrect buffer allocation size when parsing JSON strings in `mjs_json.c`...the buffer was allocated with a size of `len + 1`...the null byte was not being written *after* the `memcpy`, causing a potential for out-of-bounds write.\" This confirms the **off-by-one error** (CWE-193) leading to the **heap-based buffer overflow** (CWE-122).\n\nThe retriever results also highlight relevant CWEs, including CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error) and CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow). CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is listed but discouraged due to its high level of abstraction.\n\nBased on the evidence, CWE-193 accurately captures the root cause (the incorrect calculation). CWE-122 accurately identifies the resulting buffer overflow on the heap.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-193: Off-by-one Error**: The **Vulnerability Description** states \"**off-by-one heap-based buffer overflow**\". The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** states \"the buffer was allocated with a size of `len + 1`...the null byte was not being written *after* the `memcpy`, causing a potential for out-of-bounds write\". This aligns perfectly with CWE-193, which describes an incorrect maximum or minimum value by 1.\n*   **CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow**: The vulnerability is described as a **heap-based buffer overflow**, and the summary states \"a heap buffer overflow can occur when parsing crafted JSON strings which may write out of allocated bounds\". This aligns with CWE-122, which describes a buffer overflow occurring in the heap portion of memory.\n\nCWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer - This CWE is too general and is discouraged when more specific CWEs are available. CWE-193 and CWE-122 are more specific and accurately describe the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound - While integer overflows can lead to buffer overflows, the primary cause here is the off-by-one error in buffer allocation, not an integer overflow.\n*   CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') - This CWE is relevant to buffer overflows, but the vulnerability is more accurately described as an off-by-one error leading to the overflow, rather than a simple unchecked buffer copy.",
