The secondary CWE, CWE-787, was chosen because the **race condition** leads to \"**memory corruption**\" via an out-of-bounds write.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe691[\"CWE-691: Improperly\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5e76\u53d1\u64cd\u4f5c\"]\n\n    cwe362 -->|CHILDOF| cwe691\n    cwe362 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (CWE-362), which leads to **memory corruption** (CWE-787).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-362 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of \"**race condition**\" in the vulnerability description. The description also mentioned \"**memory corruption**\", which is a likely consequence of the race condition. Based on the retriever results and the relationships between the identified CWEs, CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) was chosen as a secondary CWE, representing the **memory corruption** issue.\n\nThe selection of CWE-362 is directly supported by the vulnerability description, which states, \"In vow, there is a possible **memory corruption** due to a **race condition**.\"\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-362 can precede CWE-787, meaning a race condition can lead to an out-of-bounds write.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity. CWE-362 is a Class, but a more specific Base CWE isn't available for the root cause. CWE-787 is a Base CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'): The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n- CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write: The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n- CWE-667: Improper Locking: While locking issues could contribute to a race condition, the description focuses on the race condition itself.\n- CWE-662: Improper Synchronization: Similar to CWE-667, this is a broader category, and CWE-362 is more specific to the race condition.\n- CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking: This is a potential cause of race conditions, but the description focuses on the existence of a race condition\n- CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource: There is no evidence that the resource wasn't initialised.\n- CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource: There is no evidence that the resource is uninitialized.\n- CWE-665: Improper Initialization: There is no evidence that the resource is improperly initialized.\n- CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread: This is a more specific type of race condition, but the description doesn't provide enough information to confirm it.\n- CWE-1021: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames: This is not related to the vulnerability description.",
