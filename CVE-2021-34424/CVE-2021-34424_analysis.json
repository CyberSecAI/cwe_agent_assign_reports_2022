Although no explicit buffer is mentioned in the description, the **exposure of the state of process memory** suggests some out-of-bounds access. The next best CWE-201 is about the disclosure of memory, which is likely the result of the buffer over-read.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe788[\"CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    \n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe126 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with some **IMPROPER HANDLING** of memory that leads to **OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ** which results in **EXPOSURE OF PROCESS MEMORY**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description mentions that the Zoom application potentially allowed for the **exposure of the state of process memory**. This issue could be used to potentially gain insight into arbitrary areas of the product's memory.
