CWE-287 is related to CWE-347 **[CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature]** through a parent-child relationship. Since the vulnerability involves **improper verification of the cryptographic signature**, CWE-347 is a more specific, Base-level CWE that is also included in the analysis. While CWE-287 is a Class, the overall context points to a specific authentication failure caused by signature validation, which is captured by the combination of CWE-287 and CWE-347.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n\n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe345 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe347 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper validation of JWT signatures** (CWE-347), leading to an authentication bypass (CWE-287) and ultimately resulting in privilege escalation. The **self-signed JWT token injection** is the exploitation technique that utilizes the weakness.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-287 **[CWE-287: Improper Authentication]** as a strong candidate due to the authentication bypass aspect of the vulnerability. However, further analysis revealed that the root cause lies in the **improper validation of JWT signatures**, as stated in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The Update Manager in affected StarWind products allows authentication with a JWT (JSON Web Token) that can be signed with any key, including a self-signed key.\"\n\nTherefore, CWE-347 **[CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature]** was also selected to provide a more precise characterization of the vulnerability. The evidence supports mapping both CWEs, with CWE-287 representing the high-level authentication failure and CWE-347 detailing the underlying cause.\n\nCWE-287 is a Class-level CWE, and the MITRE mapping guidance discourages its use when lower-level CWE entries are applicable. However, in this case, CWE-287 accurately describes the authentication bypass, while CWE-347 describes the specific mechanism that allows the bypass. Together, they provide a comprehensive view of the vulnerability.\n\nThe retriever results also showed CWE-807 **[CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision]** as a candidate. The vulnerability description states \"A self-signed JWT token could be injected into the update manager and bypass the authentication process\". While this sounds like an untrusted input is used in a security decision, JWT tokens are used specifically for authentication. The content is more specific to **improper verification of the signature**, so CWE-807 is not an ideal fit.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 4575.59\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
