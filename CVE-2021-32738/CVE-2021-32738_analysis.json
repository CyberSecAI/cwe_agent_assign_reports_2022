It is a child of the Class level CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity). No chain relationships are apparent in this case. The selection was based on the specific failure to verify the cryptographic signature, making the base CWE more appropriate than its parent.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    \n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe345 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause** of the `Utils.readChallengeTx` function's **failure** to verify the server's signature. This leads to the impact of potentially accepting forged transactions and compromising authentication.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points towards CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature) as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description and CVE reference summary explicitly state that the `Utils.readChallengeTx` function in the `js-stellar-sdk` library **does not verify that the server has signed the transaction**, despite claiming to do so.\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary states:\n\"**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `Utils.readChallengeTx` function in the `stellar-sdk` JavaScript library, used for Stellar Web Authentication (SEP-10), did not properly verify that the server account had signed the challenge transaction, despite its documentation stating that it should.\"\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-347 as the top match, further reinforcing this assessment. The mapping guidance for CWE-347 explicitly allows its use and notes that it is at the Base level of abstraction.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports the selection of CWE-347 as the primary weakness. The function's failure to verify the cryptographic signature is the direct cause of the vulnerability, leading to potential security compromises. The selection of this CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
