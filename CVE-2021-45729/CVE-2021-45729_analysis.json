The description clearly states low-role users can perform actions they should not, indicating an incorrect assignment of privileges. While `CWE-862` and `CWE-863` are related to authorization issues, the root cause points towards the assignment itself being flawed, rather than a missing or incorrect check.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe266 -->|ChildOf| cwe269\n    cwe269 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe862,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Incorrect Privilege Assignment** (`CWE-266`) which allows for **Privilege Escalation**. The impact is that authenticated low-role users can create, edit, and delete maps.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the analysis focused on access control and authorization-related CWEs due to the **Privilege Escalation** aspect. However, a closer look at the description and the retriever results pointed towards `CWE-266` (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) as a more accurate representation of the root cause. The vulnerability description states that \"authenticated low-role users\" can \"create, edit, and delete maps.\" This suggests that the privileges assigned to these low-role users are incorrect, allowing them to perform actions they should not be authorized to perform.\n\nThe evidence is based on the vulnerability description: \"The **Privilege Escalation** vulnerability discovered in the WP Google Map WordPress plugin (versions <= 1.8.0) allows authenticated low-role users to create, edit, and delete maps.\"\n\n`CWE-266` is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level. It represents the **root cause** of the issue, rather than just the impact or a missing check. The alternative CWEs considered, `CWE-862` and `CWE-863`, relate to authorization checks, but the problem lies in the initial assignment of privileges, not necessarily in the checks themselves. Therefore, `CWE-266` provides the most specific and accurate classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
