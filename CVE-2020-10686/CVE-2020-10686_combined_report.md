## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of authorization checks** on the "remove devices" form. This allows a malicious user, who has registered as themselves, to **post different credential IDs** and **remove MFA devices for other users**. The root cause is the **improper input validation** of credential IDs.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified several potential CWEs, including CWE-285, CWE-863, and CWE-1390. However, after a thorough review of the vulnerability description and the provided CWE specifications, CWE-639 was selected as the primary CWE.

The selection of CWE-639 is strongly supported by the following evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary:

*   "The system does not properly validate the credential IDs being submitted through the 'remove devices' form."
*   "The system does not verify if the user attempting to remove a device is the actual owner of that device."
*   "The attacker could then use the remove devices form to post different credential IDs and possibly remove MFA devices for other users."

These statements align closely with the description of CWE-639: "The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data."

CWE-863 was considered as a secondary CWE because it represents a more general case of incorrect authorization. However, CWE-639 is more specific because it highlights the user-controlled key aspect of the authorization bypass.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the weakness and its root cause. CWE-639 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities. The relationships between the CWEs, particularly the child-parent relationship between CWE-639 and CWE-863, support the decision to choose the more specific CWE.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10686:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Keycloak versions 8.0.2 and 9.0.0, where a user could register as themselves and then use the "remove devices" form to submit different credential IDs, potentially removing MFA devices of other users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The system does not properly validate the credential IDs being submitted through the "remove devices" form.
- **Lack of Authorization Checks:** The system does not verify if the user attempting to remove a device is the actual owner of that device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can potentially remove MFA devices for other users, preventing them from logging into their accounts. This disrupts services by locking legitimate users out.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out through the "remove devices" form in Keycloak's web interface.
- **Malicious User:**  A malicious user first registers with the system, and then exploits the vulnerability via the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Registered User:** The attacker must be a registered user in the Keycloak system.
- **Access to the "Remove Devices" Form:**  The attacker needs access to the Keycloak web interface and the "remove devices" functionality.
- **Knowledge of the API:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the device credential IDs being sent to the server through the remove device function.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships

## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
According to WASC, "Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization."

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-672
ChildOf -> CWE-672
CanPrecede -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.






## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users. In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders. If a system administrator can recover a password directly, or use a brute force search on the available information, the administrator can use the password on other accounts.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The meaning of this entry needs to be investigated more closely, especially with respect to what is meant by "recoverable."



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30018:** A messaging platform serializes all elements of User/Group objects, making private information available to adversaries




## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

### Extended Description


Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.


For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.


One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.


### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.
