It is a child of CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences) and CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). The selection of CWE-113 is based on the specific weakness described in the vulnerability, i.e., the **improper neutralization** of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers, leading to HTTP request/response splitting. The relationship to CWE-93 indicates that the broader issue is the **improper handling** of CRLF sequences, while the relationship to CWE-20 highlights the **improper input validation** aspect.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe436[\"CWE-436: Unintended Interpretation of Data as Code\"]\n    \n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe436\n    cwe113 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe113 primary\n    class cwe93,cwe20,cwe436,cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input handling**, leading to **HTTP header injection**.

The \"**HTTP header injection**\" vulnerability key phrase, coupled with the description of how a remote attacker can alter stored information, strongly suggests CWE-113.\n\nThe **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** section provides explicit evidence: \"The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization or validation of user-controlled input that is used to construct HTTP headers.
