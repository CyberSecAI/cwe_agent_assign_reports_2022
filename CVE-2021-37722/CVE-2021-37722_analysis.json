The Retriever Results also show a strong match for CWE-78.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements in a command, leading to **remote command execution**. This means an attacker can inject malicious commands that the system executes.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-78, given the **remote command execution** vulnerability and the **improper neutralization** weakness highlighted in the description and CVE reference. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly states the \"**Root cause of vulnerability**: Authenticated command injection vulnerabilities exist in the ArubaOS command line interface,\" which directly aligns with the CWE-78 description.\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity because it clearly defines the **root cause** as an OS command injection vulnerability. The evidence is strong, and the relationship analysis supports this classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-184\n- CANALSOBE -> CWE-88\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-77\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-77\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-74",
