The vulnerability description clearly points to a **stack overflow** caused by unbounded recursion within the `parse_array` function. The recursive calls consume excessive stack resources, aligning with CWE-674.\n\nSecondary CWEs like CWE-1325 [Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation] and CWE-789 [Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value] were considered, as excessive recursion can lead to uncontrolled memory allocation. However, the primary issue is the lack of control over the recursion depth, making CWE-674 the most relevant.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\"]\n    cwe1325[\"CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n\n    cwe674 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    cwe1325 -->|PEEROF| cwe789\n    cwe674 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe1325\n    cwe674 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe789\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe674 primary\n    class cwe1325,cwe789 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **uncontrolled recursion** in the `parse_array` function (CWE-674). This leads to excessive stack usage and ultimately a **stack overflow**. The stack overflow can cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nCWE-674 -> Excessive stack usage -> Stack Overflow -> Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly pointed towards CWE-674 [Uncontrolled Recursion] as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions a **stack overflow** due to unbounded recursion. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms the root cause: \"The vulnerability is caused by a stack overflow in the `mjs` (embedded JavaScript engine) library when parsing deeply nested arrays. The `parse_array` function recursively calls itself, leading to excessive stack usage when processing nested array structures.\"\n\nThe Retriever Results listed CWE-674 as a possible match, reinforcing the initial assessment. While other CWEs such as CWE-1325 [Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation] and CWE-789 [Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value] were considered due to the potential for excessive memory allocation during recursion, CWE-674 remains the most accurate representation of the root cause.\n\nThe decision to classify this vulnerability as CWE-674 is based on the evidence of **uncontrolled recursion** leading to a **stack overflow**. The vulnerability chain and relationship analysis further support this classification. While CWE-674 is a Class-level CWE, there isn't a more specific Base or Variant CWE that accurately captures the unbounded recursion issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
