The vulnerability description explicitly states a heap overflow occurs due to insufficient buffer size.|\n| CWE-295 | Improper Certificate Validation | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The agent's failure to validate HTTPS certificates enables a MITM attack, which is a prerequisite to the heap overflow.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the parent-child relationship between CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow). Since the overflow occurs in the heap, CWE-122 is a more specific and accurate classification than its parent.\n\nThe presence of CWE-295 enables an attacker to position themselves to trigger the heap overflow, so there is a CanPrecede relationship between CWE-295 and CWE-122.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe295[\"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe295 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe122\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe295 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper certificate validation (CWE-295)**, allowing an attacker to perform a MITM attack. This allows the attacker to send a malicious `NEWSCAN` request with an oversized POST payload, leading to a **heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)** in the agent.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly supports the classification of this vulnerability as **CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow**, due to the direct mention of the **heap overflow** in the vulnerability description and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\".\n> \"If POST payload is larger, then **heap overflow** will occur.\"\n\nThe vulnerability also involves **CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation** because the agent does not validate HTTPS certificates, enabling a MITM attack which is a prerequisite for the heap overflow.\n\nThe selection of CWE-122 is at the Variant level, which is the most specific level supported by the evidence, aligning with best practices.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly

Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses

root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation.
