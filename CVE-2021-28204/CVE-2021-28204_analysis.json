CWE-78 represents the specific case of command injection into the OS. CWE-184 is a related CWE, which can precede command injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: OS Command Injection\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe184 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe78\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe184 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper filtering of specific parameters**, which leads to **command injection**, allowing remote attackers to **execute arbitrary commands**.\n- **Root Cause:** Improper Filtering (Lack of Input Validation)\n- **Weakness:** OS Command Injection\n- **Impact:** Arbitrary Command Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which states that the function **does not filter the specific parameter**, leading to **command injection**.\n\nThe retriever results show CWE-77 as the top result, but the vulnerability description refers to OS command injection, so CWE-78 is a better fit. CWE-78 is a base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The description of CWE-78 states: \"The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\" This matches the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-184 is also considered as a secondary CWE, as the **lack of filtering** implies an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.\n\n```text\nThe specific function in ASUS BMCs firmware Web management page (Modify users information function) **does not filter the specific parameter**. As obtaining the administrator permission, remote attackers can launch **command injection** to execute command arbitrary.\n```\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
