The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section lists \"**missing permission check**\" as the rootcause. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary section lacks specific root cause details, further emphasizing the reliance on the primary description.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is optimal because it directly addresses the core issue of **missing authorization**. While other CWEs like CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) were considered, they don't accurately represent the specific **missing permission check**. The choice of CWE-862 aligns with the principle of selecting the most specific CWE that matches the vulnerability's root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community.
