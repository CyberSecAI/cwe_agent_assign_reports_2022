The application stores passwords in a recoverable plaintext format. |\n| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The application stores sensitive user profile passwords in a way that allows retrieval in cleartext. |\n| CWE-522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE. The application's credential management is insufficient, leading to the exposure of passwords. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-256, which is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-522. CWE-312 is also a child of CWE-311. These parent-child relationships help refine the selection to the most specific applicable CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe312,cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves **improper credentials management**, leading to the storage of passwords in a way that a local attacker can retrieve them in cleartext, ultimately compromising the user's information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the provided information, the primary weakness is the storage of passwords in a recoverable plaintext format, which is best represented by CWE-256. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the retrieval of profile passwords in **clear text format**, supporting this classification. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms the root cause: \"The Parallels Remote Application Server (RAS) stores user profile passwords in an encrypted file. A local attacker can upload a previously stored cyphered file and retrieve the password in **clear text format**.\"\n\nCWE-312 is considered as a secondary CWE because the passwords are being exposed in cleartext. While they may be encrypted initially the attacker is able to retrieve the plaintext password.\n\nCWE-522 is also a secondary consideration, as it represents the broader issue of insufficiently protected credentials.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-256 being the most precise representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
