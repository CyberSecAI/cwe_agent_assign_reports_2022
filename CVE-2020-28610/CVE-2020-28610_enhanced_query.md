# Enhanced Query for CVE-2020-28610

# Vulnerability Description

    Multiple code execution vulnerabilities exists in the Nef polygon-parsing functionality of CGAL libcgal CGAL-5.1.1. A specially crafted malformed file can lead to an **out-of-bounds read** and **type confusion**, which could lead to code execution. An attacker can provide malicious input to trigger any of these vulnerabilities. An oob read vulnerability exists in Nef_S2/SM_io_parser.h SM_io_parserread_vertex() set_face().
