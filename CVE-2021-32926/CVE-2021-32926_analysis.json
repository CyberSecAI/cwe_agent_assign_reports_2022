It indicates a lack of proper verification of endpoints or integrity of the communication channel. The vulnerability description clearly states that an attacker can intercept the password hash during a password change request. The retriever results also suggest CWE-300 as a potential match.\n\nCWE-300's parent is CWE-923 (Improperly Implemented Security Check).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe300[\"CWE-300: Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint\"]\n    cwe923[\"CWE-923: Improperly Implemented Security Check\"]\n\n    cwe300 -->|ChildOf| cwe923\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe300 primary\n    class cwe923 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** that the channel is accessible by a non-endpoint (CWE-300). This allows the attacker to intercept and replace the legitimate password hash. The impact is a denial-of-service condition because the legitimate user can no longer authenticate.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the description \"When an authenticated password change request takes place, this vulnerability could allow the attacker to intercept the message that includes the legitimate, new password hash and replace it with an illegitimate hash,\" leans towards CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint). The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" further supports this by stating, \"The vulnerability stems from the ability to intercept and modify the password hash during a password change request.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-300 is at the appropriate level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the ability of an attacker to intercept and modify the password hash due to a lack of proper channel security. While other CWEs like CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) or CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) could be considered, they are less specific.\n\nCWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) was considered because the intercepted password hash could potentially be transmitted in cleartext. However, the description focuses on the interception and replacement of the hash, not necessarily on its transmission method. If the hash was transmitted in clear text, that could be a separate vulnerability.\n\nCWE-620 (Unverified Password Change) was also considered, but it's less relevant because the issue isn't about the lack of verification of the original password but the ability to intercept and modify the new password hash during the change process.\n\nUltimately, CWE-300 is the most accurate representation of the vulnerability based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
