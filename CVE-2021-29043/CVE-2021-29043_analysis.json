CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) is a more specific case of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials). The vulnerability description directly states that the proxy password is not obfuscated, which clearly indicates plaintext storage. Therefore, CWE-256 is the more accurate and specific classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** that the Liferay Portal **does not obfuscate the S3 stores proxy password**. This leads to the impact where attackers can **steal the proxy password**. The vector of attack involves man-in-the-middle attacks or shoulder surfing.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description states that Liferay Portal \" **does not obfuscate the S3 stores proxy password**\". This indicates a clear case of storing the password in a form that is easily readable, which directly aligns with CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password).\n\nThe Retriever Results also suggested CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) and CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data). However, CWE-256 is a more specific instance of CWE-522, making it a better fit. CWE-201 was considered but deemed less relevant because the core issue is not about *sending* sensitive data, but about the insecure *storage* of a credential.\n\nThe decision is primarily based on the provided evidence: \"**does not obfuscate the S3 stores proxy password**\". The graph relationships further support this by showing that CWE-256 is a child of CWE-522, allowing for a more specific classification. The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product acts as an intermediary HTTP agent\n         (such as a proxy or firewall) in the data flow between two\n         entities such as a client and server, but it does not\n         interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that\n         are consistent with how the messages will be processed by\n         those entities that are at the ultimate destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
