It has several children representing more specific types of privilege assignment issues. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) and CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) are class-level CWEs, representing higher-level abstractions of the weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe266 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe286\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect privilege assignment** in the template role, leading to the potential exposure of sensitive information due to the **exceeding of expected display-only permissions**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description indicates that a template role in SAP NetWeaver Application Server has transport authorizations that **exceed expected display-only permissions**. This points directly to an issue with how privileges are assigned.\n\nCWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) is selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **incorrect assignment of privileges**. The vulnerability description states that the template role has authorizations that **exceed expected display-only permissions**, indicating a problem with how privileges are assigned to that role.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) and CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) were considered as secondary CWEs. While the **exceeding of expected display-only permissions** could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, the root cause is the **incorrect privilege assignment**. Therefore, CWE-200 and CWE-668 are less direct and more of a consequence than a root cause.\n\nThe final decision is based on the available evidence and the desire to identify the most specific and accurate CWE. CWE-266 is a base-level CWE that directly addresses the **incorrect assignment of privileges**, making it the most appropriate choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product acts as an intermediary HTTP agent\n         (such as a proxy or firewall) in the data flow between two\n         entities such as a client and server, but it does not\n         interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that\n         are consistent with how the messages will be processed by\n         those entities that are at the ultimate destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
