However, as the provided description focuses on the exposure of email addresses, which falls under private personal information, CWE-359 is a good candidate. Despite this, the description of the vulnerability is generic, so it's more appropriate to assign CWE-200.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe359 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is relatively straightforward: the Mattermost Boards plugin **fails to protect email addresses**, leading to the **exposure of sensitive information** to unauthorized users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified that the Mattermost Boards plugin **fails to protect email addresses**, which allows both authenticated and unauthorized users to access this data. This is a clear case of sensitive information being exposed. The primary concern is **the root cause of the failure to protect**.\n\nThe retriever results suggest CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor), CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor), and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) as potential candidates.\n\nCWE-200 is a high-level class, but it accurately describes the general issue. The MITRE mapping guidance discourages its use, recommending more specific CWEs. The vulnerability description states \"Mattermost Boards plugin v0.10.0 and earlier **fails to protect email addresses** of all users via one of the Boards APIs, which allows authenticated and unauthorized users to access this information resulting in sensitive & private information disclosure.\"\n\nCWE-359 is a more specific Base level CWE that directly addresses the exposure of private personal information, which is applicable given that email addresses are considered private personal information.\n\nI am selecting CWE-200 as the primary weakness because the description does not provide the specific mechanism that failed to protect the email addresses.\nI am selecting CWE-359 as a secondary weakness because email addresses are private personal information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Vulnerability Mapping Notes:** The description doesn't involve resource reuse, so this CWE is not applicable.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Vulnerability Mapping Notes:** The description doesn't describe insufficient granularity of access control, so this CWE is not applicable.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n**Vulnerability Mapping Notes:** The description doesn't involve the exposure of a resource to the wrong control sphere, so this CWE is not applicable.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Vulnerability Mapping Notes:** The description doesn't involve improper resource shutdown or release, so this CWE is not applicable.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Vulnerability Mapping Notes:** The description doesn't involve inserting information into external files, so this CWE is not applicable.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Vulnerability Mapping Notes:** The description doesn't involve reliance on untrusted inputs, so this CWE is not applicable.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n**Vulnerability Mapping Notes:** The description doesn't involve insufficient privileges, so this CWE is not applicable.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Vulnerability Mapping Notes:** The description doesn't involve authorization bypass through a user-controlled key, so this CWE is not applicable.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Vulnerability Mapping Notes:** The",
