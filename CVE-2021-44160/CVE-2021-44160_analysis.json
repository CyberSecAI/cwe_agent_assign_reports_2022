It is a child of CWE-642, Permissive Whitelist, CWE-669, Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres, and CWE-602, Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe565[\"CWE-565: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe642[\"CWE-642: Permissive Whitelist\"]\n    cwe669[\"CWE-669: Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres\"]\n    cwe602[\"CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe565 -->|CHILDOF| cwe642\n    cwe565 -->|CHILDOF| cwe669\n    cwe565 -->|CHILDOF| cwe602\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe565 secondary\n    class cwe863,cwe284,cwe642,cwe669,cwe602 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper authentication** leading to an attacker gaining unauthorized access by modifying the cookie parameter. This allows the attacker to acquire another user's privileges, perform limited operations, or modify data, ultimately resulting in partial service unavailability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **improper authentication** as the root cause.\n\nThe final conclusion is that CWE-639, Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key, is the most appropriate primary CWE because the attacker is modifying a key value (cookie parameter) to access another user's data. This aligns with the description of CWE-639: \"The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\" The evidence is taken directly from \"a remote attacker can acquire another general users privilege by modifying the cookie parameter without authentication.\"\n\nCWE-565, Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking, is a relevant secondary CWE because the vulnerability involves modifying cookie parameters, indicating a lack of validation and integrity checking.\n\nCWE-287, Improper Authentication, was considered but not chosen as the primary CWE because it's a class-level CWE, and CWE-639 is a more specific base-level CWE that directly addresses the mechanism of authorization bypass via user-controlled keys.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-639 being a base-level CWE that accurately describes the vulnerability mechanism, and CWE-565 highlighting the lack of cookie validation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-3",
