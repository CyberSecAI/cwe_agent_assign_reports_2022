It also has a PeerOf relationship with CWE-295 **Improper Certificate Validation**. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **lack of entity authentication** during key exchange, making CWE-322 a strong fit. While CWE-300 **Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint** is related, it's a Class level CWE and is discouraged for use when more specific CWEs exist.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe322[\"CWE-322: Key Exchange without Entity Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Authentication Required for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe295[\"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\"]\n\n    cwe322 -->|CHILDOF| cwe306\n    cwe322 -->|PEEROF| cwe295\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe322 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe295 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of entity authentication** during key exchange (CWE-322), which could lead to a man-in-the-middle attack, potentially resulting in the interception of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, especially the **Root cause of vulnerability** which states \"IBM QRadar SIEM performs key exchange without entity authentication on inter-host communications\". The description of CWE-322 directly aligns with the vulnerability. The Retriever Results also lists CWE-322 as the top candidate.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-322 being a Base CWE that directly addresses the root cause. Other CWEs like CWE-300 and CWE-319 were considered but deemed less specific or less directly relevant. CWE-300 is a class level that is discouraged and CWE-319 relates to cleartext transmission and the rootcause here is about the lack of authentication.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAccording to WASC, \"Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
