This indicates a parent-child relationship where CWE-367 is a more specific case of a race condition. The abstraction levels also support this, with CWE-367 being a Base level and CWE-362 being a Class level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    \n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe367 primary\n    class cwe362 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a **time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition** leading to local privilege escalation. The root cause is the race condition, and the impact is the privilege escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-367 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of \"time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition\" in the vulnerability description. The supporting evidence in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms that the vulnerability type is a race condition. The Retriever Results also listed CWE-367 as a strong candidate.\n\nThe relationship analysis shows that CWE-367 is a child of CWE-362, which represents a more general race condition. Since the vulnerability description specifically mentions TOCTOU, it is more appropriate to assign CWE-367.\n\nThe final decision is based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the supporting information from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The selection of CWE-367 provides the optimal level of specificity, as it accurately represents the type of race condition.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
