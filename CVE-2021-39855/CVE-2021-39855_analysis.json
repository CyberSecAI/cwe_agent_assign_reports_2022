However, CWE-668 isn't a strong fit, so CWE-200 was chosen despite the discouraged mapping guidance, because of the **impact** described in the Vulnerability Description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe618[\"CWE-618: Exposed Unsafe ActiveX Method\"]\n    cwe749[\"CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function\"]\n\n    cwe200 -->|ChildOf| cwe668\n    cwe618 -->|ChildOf| cwe749\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe618 secondary\n    class cwe749 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an unauthenticated attacker crafting a malicious Microsoft Office file or webpage. The user opens the file or visits the page, which leads to the exposure of NTLMv2 credentials.\n\nRoot Cause: Crafted Microsoft Office file or webpage.\nWeakness: Information Disclosure.\nImpact: Obtain NTLMv2 credentials.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the information disclosure aspect of the vulnerability. The primary CWE, CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor), was selected because the vulnerability results in the exposure of NTLMv2 credentials to an unauthenticated attacker.\n\nThe \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" lists **impact: Information Disclosure**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" further supports this, stating, \"The vulnerability is categorized as 'Information Exposure'. Specifically, it allows for arbitrary file system reads\" and \"Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present: Information exposure via arbitrary file system read.\"\n\nCWE-200 is classified as a Class-level CWE, and the mapping guidance states it is \"Discouraged\" because it is commonly misused and often represents the impact rather than the root cause. However, in this case, the **impact** is a central element of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-618 (Exposed Unsafe ActiveX Method) was considered as a possible secondary CWE, and it aligns with the description of the Acrobat Reader DC ActiveX Control being the vulnerable component. This is a Variant-level CWE with Allowed usage. While the description does not explicitly state the use of an ActiveX method, the mention of \"ActiveX Control\" makes this a plausible secondary factor.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at appropriate levels of specificity, with CWE-200 capturing the **impact** of information disclosure and CWE-618 identifying the vulnerable component.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-606: Unchecked Input for Loop Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
