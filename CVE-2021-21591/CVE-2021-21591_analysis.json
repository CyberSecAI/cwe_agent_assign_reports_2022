While CWE-522 and CWE-312 are related, they are broader and less specific. CWE-256 is a child of CWE-522, making it a more precise classification. The relationships between CWE-256, CWE-522, and CWE-312 highlight the hierarchy of credential protection weaknesses, with CWE-256 pinpointing the specific issue of plaintext storage.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe523[\"CWE-523: Unprotected Transport of Credentials\"] -->|CANALSOBE| cwe312\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n    class cwe312 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **plaintext password storage** (**CWE-256**), which leads to the impact of a local attacker gaining unauthorized access to the system with the privileges of the compromised user.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly indicates that **CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password)** is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section explicitly identifies \"**plaintext password storage**\" as the **rootcause**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also states that the \"Root cause of vulnerability\" is \"Plain-text password storage.\" This direct evidence supports the selection of CWE-256. While **CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials)** is listed as the \"Primary CWE Match\" for similar CVE descriptions and **CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information)** is also a consideration, CWE-256 is more specific and directly addresses the identified **rootcause**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-256 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly corresponds to the **rootcause** described in the vulnerability.\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.

In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders. If a system administrator can recover a password directly, or use a brute force search on the available information, the administrator can use the password on other accounts.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm or scheme that produces insufficient entropy, leaving patterns or clusters of values that are more likely to occur than others.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5303.11\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is",
