CWE-94 is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) and CWE-913 (Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources). It can follow CWE-98 (Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')). CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) is a Class level CWE and a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n    cwe98[\"CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe98 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe94\n    cwe269 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe269 secondary\n    class cwe74,cwe913,cwe98,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a local privileged user (1) being able to inject malicious code (2) which leads to the execution of that code.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates a code injection vulnerability that can be exploited by a local privileged user to execute malicious code.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')), which accurately captures the **root cause** of the vulnerability, where the product constructs a code segment using externally-influenced input without proper neutralization, leading to potential arbitrary code execution.\n\nThe secondary CWE is CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) which highlights that the attacker needs to be a local privileged user to exploit the vulnerability. The evidence is insufficient to map a privilege management issue as the **root cause** of this vulnerability.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was considered but not selected because CWE-94 is a more specific Base level CWE that better describes the vulnerability. The mapping guidance for CWE-20 discourages its use when lower-level CWEs are available. The description states that the code is constructed using external input, but it does not mention improper validation of the input. Therefore, the improper control of code generation is more relevant than the improper input validation.\n\nCWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) was also considered but not selected. CWE-73 is about external control of file names or paths. The description doesn't mention that the vulnerability involves file names or paths.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **root cause** of the vulnerability (CWE-94) and an attacker characteristic (CWE-269).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes output that is written to logs.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
