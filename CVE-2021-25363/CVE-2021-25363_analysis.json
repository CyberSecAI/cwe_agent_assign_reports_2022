Due to lack of more specific details, it is difficult to narrow down to a Base or Variant CWE. CWE-284 is a parent of CWE-285 and many authorization and authentication related CWEs. CWE-285, Improper Authorization, is a child of CWE-284. CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, is a more specific type of CWE-285. However, based on the vulnerability description, it is difficult to confirm that the authorization check was performed incorrectly, versus not performed at all.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control**, which allows untrusted applications to access running processes and delete local files.\n  - CWE-284 Improper Access Control (Root Cause)\n  - Access running processes and delete local files (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **improper access control** vulnerability description, which is the root cause. The vulnerability allows untrusted applications to access running processes and delete local files, which is the impact.\n\nBased on the retriever results, CWE-284, CWE-285, and CWE-863 were considered. CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, while CWE-285 is a Class, and CWE-863 is also a Class, and a child of CWE-285.\n\nCWE-284 is selected as the primary CWE because the description explicitly mentions **improper access control**. The relationship graph shows that CWE-285 and CWE-863 are children of CWE-284, providing a more granular view of the vulnerability, but the current evidence is insufficient to confirm.\n\nCWE-284 is at the optimal level of specificity, given the available evidence. While more specific CWEs like CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) exist, the description does not provide enough detail to confirm that the authorization was performed incorrectly, rather than missing altogether. Further investigation would be needed to determine a more specific CWE.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n### CWE-284: Improper Access Control\n**Abstraction:** Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.156\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-284 is extremely high-level, a Pillar. Its name, \"Improper Access Control,\" is often misused in low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287] or by active use of the OWASP Top Ten, such as \"A01:2021-Broken Access Control\". It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n### CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.142\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\n### CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Similarity Score**: 5156.84\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate",
