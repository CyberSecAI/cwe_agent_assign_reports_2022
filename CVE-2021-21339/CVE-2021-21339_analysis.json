CWE-209 [Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information] is a potential consequence or related weakness that could arise from the cleartext storage, especially in combination with other vulnerabilities like SQL injection. This creates a chain where the initial flaw (cleartext storage) can lead to sensitive data exposure in error messages.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe209 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe312\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe209 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** of storing user session identifiers in **cleartext**. This **cleartext storage** (CWE-312) doesn't directly cause harm, but it becomes a critical vulnerability when combined with other issues like SQL injection. If an attacker exploits another vulnerability and gains access to the stored session identifiers, they can potentially hijack user sessions. Furthermore, if the system generates error messages, the **cleartext session identifiers** might be exposed in those messages (CWE-209), further aiding an attacker.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis and resulting conclusion are based on the clear description of the vulnerability, which explicitly states that user session identifiers are stored in **cleartext**. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-312 [Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information]. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this: \"The primary **weakness** is the **sensitive data exposure** due to the lack of cryptographic protection for session identifiers. This corresponds to **CWE-312**.\" The relationship analysis highlights that the **cleartext storage** can lead to other issues, such as exposing sensitive information in error messages (CWE-209) if other vulnerabilities are present. CWE-312 is chosen because it directly addresses the root cause, which is the **insecure storage** of sensitive data. The evidence strongly supports this classification, and the CWE is at the optimal level of specificity (Base). CWE-209 is a secondary concern, as it's a potential consequence rather than the primary **weakness**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n- **Not Used:** This CWE is not relevant because the issue is not about the *implementation* of an authentication algorithm, but the complete lack of encryption for session identifiers.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n- **Not Used:** While related to security, this CWE is too high-level.
