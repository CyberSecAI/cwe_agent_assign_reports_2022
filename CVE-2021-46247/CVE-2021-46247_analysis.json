Since the description specifically mentions a \"cryptographic key,\" CWE-321 is a more precise classification than its parent.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain is straightforward: the root cause is the **hard-coded cryptographic key**, which directly leads to the impact that encrypted data may be recovered.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description clearly states \"**hard-coded cryptographic key** significantly increases the possibility encrypted data may be recovered\". The Retriever Results highlighted CWE-321 **[CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key]** as the top candidate.\n\nThe relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-321 **[CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key]** is a variant of CWE-798 **[CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials]**, making it more specific. The mapping guidance for CWE-321 **[CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key]** recommends its use, stating: \"This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\"\n\nTherefore, CWE-321 **[CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key]** is the most appropriate choice, as it directly reflects the **hard-coded cryptographic key** issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product violates well-established principles for secure design.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
