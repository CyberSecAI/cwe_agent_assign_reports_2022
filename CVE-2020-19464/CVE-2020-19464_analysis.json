CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion is a Class level CWE and a child of CWE-834 (Excessive Iteration). The description mentions a \"stack overflow\", and the provided summary indicates uncontrolled recursion as a potential cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe674 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe674 secondary\n    class cwe787,cwe119,cwe834 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with either a stack-based buffer overflow, or uncontrolled recursion which can lead to stack exhaustion and denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **stack overflow** mentioned in the vulnerability description and the **stack overflow** and uncontrolled recursion mentioned in the reference summary. The retriever results also pointed to CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow as the best candidate. Given that the **weakness** is a **stack overflow** , and the function `XRef::fetch` is vulnerable to uncontrolled recursion leading to a **stack overflow** , CWE-121 and CWE-674 are appropriate. CWE-121 is the primary cause as it directly reflects the buffer overflow on the stack, while CWE-674 is secondary because it can lead to the overflow.\n\n*   \"An issue has been found in function XReffetch in PDF2JSON 0.70 that allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service due to a **stack overflow**.\"\n*   \"The vulnerability is caused by a **stack overflow** in the `XRef::fetch` function.\"\n*   \"A **stack overflow** vulnerability exists due to uncontrolled recursion or a very large stack allocation within the `XRef::fetch` function, potentially when processing a crafted PDF file.\"\n\nCWE-121 is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is preferred. CWE-674 is at the Class level, but it accurately describes the uncontrolled recursion aspect.\n\n**CWE Considerations:**\n\n*   **CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound:** While this CWE was suggested by the retriever, there is no mention of integer overflows in the description or summary.\n*   **CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling:** This CWE is too broad. While uncontrolled recursion could be considered a resource allocation issue, CWE-674 is more specific.\n*   **CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow'):** This is less specific than CWE-121 since the location of the buffer on the stack is explicitly mentioned.\n*   **CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** This is incorrect since the vulnerability is explicitly a stack overflow.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n\n### Description\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-788\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\n**Abstraction:** Class\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place, consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-834\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate",
