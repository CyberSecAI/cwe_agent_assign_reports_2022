# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-42139

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-94 | Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') | 1 | Base | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-502 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-94, which is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-74. The secondary CWE considered is CWE-502. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-94 is a good fit because the vulnerability involves the **improper control of code generation**, leading to code injection. CWE-502 is considered because the vulnerability involves parsing a YAML file, which is a form of deserialization. However, the root cause is more directly related to code injection, making CWE-94 the primary classification.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of weaknesses is as follows:
1.  **Improper handling of YAML files with `EXTENDED_SCHEMA` enabled.**
2.  **Code Injection** due to the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code via the `!!js/function` tag.

The root cause is the **improper handling** of the `!!js/function` tag within YAML files when `EXTENDED_SCHEMA` is enabled. This leads directly to code injection.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference, indicates a clear case of **code injection**. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code by crafting malicious YAML files using the `!!js/function` tag.

The primary CWE selected is CWE-94, which accurately reflects the **improper control of code generation** leading to **code injection**. This decision is supported by the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions "Code Injection", and the CVE reference, which details how the `!!js/function` tag enables arbitrary JavaScript execution.

The relationship graph highlights that CWE-94 is a child of CWE-74 (a more general injection category) and CWE-913. While CWE-74 is a parent, CWE-94 provides a more specific classification for this vulnerability.

The selection of CWE-94 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability. While CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data) is relevant due to the use of YAML files, it is not the primary issue. The core problem is the ability to inject and execute code, making CWE-94 the most accurate classification.

CWE-74, CWE-95, CWE-96, CWE-1336, and CWE-88 were considered but not ultimately chosen as the primary CWE. CWE-74 is too broad, while CWE-95 and CWE-96 are related to specific types of code injection (dynamic and static, respectively), which are not explicitly detailed in the description. CWE-1336 and CWE-88 are not directly applicable to the described vulnerability.
CWE-116 was considered, but it relates more to encoding issues, which is not the primary problem here.
CWE-834 was not selected because there is no evidence of excessive iteration or looping.
CWE-502 was considered as a secondary issue because deserialization of untrusted data enables the code injection.
