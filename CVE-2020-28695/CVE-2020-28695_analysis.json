It is a child of CWE-77 and CWE-74. The secondary CWE is CWE-798, which is a base-level CWE describing the use of Hard-coded Credentials. It is a child of CWE-1391, CWE-287, CWE-344, and CWE-671 and a peer of CWE-257.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe344[\"CWE-344: Use of Inadequate Algorithm\"]\n    cwe671[\"CWE-671: Improper Handling of Multiple Bytes per Character (Multibyte issues)\"]\n    cwe257[\"CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe344\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe671\n    cwe798 --|PEEROF| cwe257\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe74,cwe798,cwe1391,cwe287,cwe344,cwe671,cwe257 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **lack of sanitization of user input** in the Askey Fiber Router's Admin Dashboard tools, leading to **command injection**, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands and potentially **retrieve admin credentials**. The **retrieval of admin credentials** can be seen as a separate weakness or a consequence of the command injection.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is clearly **CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section explicitly states that the **root cause** is \"lack of sanitization of user input in the Askey Fiber Router's Admin Dashboard tools (Ping, DNS Lookup, Traceroute). This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands.\" This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-78, which involves constructing an OS command using externally-influenced input without proper neutralization. The impact, as described, includes Remote Code Execution, full system compromise, data theft, and denial of service, all of which are consequences of successful command injection.\n\nThe description also mentions \"retrieval of admin credentials.\" While the primary attack vector is command injection, the ability to retrieve credentials suggests a potential secondary weakness related to credential management. **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials** is a plausible candidate, especially since the vulnerability leads to retrieval of admin credentials.\n\nThe retriever results also list **CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials**, **CWE-259 Use of Hard-coded Password**, and **CWE-321 Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key**, however these can be considered as a secondary issue, because the primary attack vector is the command injection.\n\nBased on the evidence and the retriever results, the most appropriate CWEs are **CWE-78** as the primary root cause and **CWE-798** as a secondary related weakness.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**:

Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data
