## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper authentication mechanism in Hillrom's Welch Allyn Cardio products when configured to use Single Sign-On (SSO). The application allows manual entry of any Active Directory (AD) account provisioned within the application without requiring a password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the normal authentication process.
*   **Improper Authentication:** The application fails to properly validate user credentials when SSO is enabled, specifically when manually entering an AD account, without password verification

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation grants an attacker access to the application using the supplied AD account.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the same privileges as the compromised AD account, potentially leading to full system control.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact**: Successful exploitation allows for the unauthorized viewing, modification and disruption of data and/or systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable system.
*   **Knowledge of AD Accounts:** The attacker needs to know the names of valid AD accounts that are provisioned within the vulnerable application.
*   **No Privileged Access Required:** The attacker does not need prior privileged access to perform this attack

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), indicating a high severity.
*   Affected products include various Welch Allyn cardio products when configured to use SSO.
*   The vulnerability is present when SSO is enabled; disabling SSO is a recommended mitigation.
*   The advisory suggests network segmentation, firewalls, and secure remote access methods (VPNs) as general mitigations, as well as standard authentication procedures for server access, in addition to disabling SSO.

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.
