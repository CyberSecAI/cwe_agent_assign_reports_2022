This selection is further reinforced by its relationship to CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), indicating that the alternate path lacks proper authentication. CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a parent Class of CWE-288 and CWE-306. This hierarchical relationship suggests a broader issue of authentication failure, but CWE-288 provides a more specific description of the bypass mechanism.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe306\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe288 primary\n    class cwe287,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper authentication vulnerability** when SSO is enabled. This allows manual entry of any Active Directory account without requiring a password, leading to authentication bypass and unauthorized access to the application with associated privileges. The root cause is the **improper authentication**, and the impact is unauthorized access and potential privilege escalation.\n1.  Improper Authentication (Root Cause)\n2.  Authentication Bypass (Alternate Path)\n3.  Unauthorized Access (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The **improper authentication vulnerability** and subsequent ability to bypass authentication by manually entering an AD account without a password pointed towards CWE-288 as the most appropriate classification.\n\nThe vulnerability description states, \"This vulnerability allows the application to accept manual entry of any active directory (AD) account provisioned in the application without supplying a password, resulting in access to the application as the supplied AD account, with all associated privileges.\" This statement directly supports the classification of CWE-288 as an Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel, where the manual entry of an AD account acts as the alternate path.\n\nCWE-288 is at the Base level of abstraction, providing a more specific description than its parent class, CWE-287. While CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) could be considered, CWE-288 more accurately captures the bypass mechanism. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is also a possible candidate, as the alternate path lacks authentication, but CWE-288 encompasses both the bypass and the lack of authentication in the alternate path more completely.\n\nThe evidence and retriever results support the selection of CWE-288 as the primary CWE.\n\n**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**\n\n*   **CWE-287 Improper Authentication:** While relevant, it is a high-level class. The vulnerability details point to a specific type of improper authentication (bypass using an alternate path), making CWE-288 a better fit. The mapping guidance discourages using CWE-287 when lower-level CWEs are applicable.\n*   **CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function:** This CWE is also relevant, as the alternate path lacks authentication. However, CWE-288 encompasses both the bypass and the missing authentication, making it a more comprehensive classification.\n*   **CWE-1390 Weak Authentication:** Similar to CWE-287, this is a class-level CWE. The vulnerability is more specific than simply \"weak\" authentication.\n*   **CWE-303 Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm:** This is not applicable because the vulnerability doesn't seem to stem from an incorrect implementation of a defined algorithm, but from a missing authentication check in an alternate path.\n*   **CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration:** This CWE addresses session management issues, which are not the primary focus of this vulnerability.\n*   **CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization:** This is not applicable because the vulnerability is about authentication (verifying identity) rather than authorization (verifying access rights).\n*   **CWE-256 Plaintext Storage of a Password & CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials:** These CWEs are not applicable because the vulnerability is not about storing or transmitting credentials insecurely, but about bypassing the authentication process altogether.",
