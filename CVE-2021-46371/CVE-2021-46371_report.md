# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-46371

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-306, which is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). CWE-862 is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization). While both authentication and authorization issues are present, the description emphasizes the lack of authentication as the primary issue, hence the higher confidence in CWE-306. These CWEs are related to the broader category of Improper Access Control (CWE-284), but are more specific and therefore more appropriate.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain starts with a **lack of authentication** for critical functions (CWE-306). This leads to **missing authorization** checks (CWE-862), allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data. The final impact is **information disclosure**.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on the **incorrect access control** (**WEAKNESS**) mentioned in the vulnerability description. The retriever results suggested CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')), and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) as potential candidates.

The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section provides key evidence: "Unauthorized access to API endpoints due to a **lack of proper authentication** or authorization mechanisms." This statement directly supports the selection of CWE-306. The summary also states, "Lack of authorization allows unauthenticated users to directly access sensitive data by accessing API endpoints." This supports the selection of CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).

CWE-306 is selected as the primary CWE because the **root cause** is the **missing authentication** mechanism. The impact of this is unauthorized access and information disclosure.

CWE-862 is selected as a secondary CWE because after an unauthenticated user has gained access, the system also **fails to authorize** their requests to access sensitive data.

CWE-284, CWE-285, and CWE-287 were considered but not selected because they are class-level CWEs and less specific than CWE-306 and CWE-862.
CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) was also considered, but it is less specific than CWE-306 because the issue is not simply a matter of directly accessing URLs, but rather the complete **lack of authentication**.
