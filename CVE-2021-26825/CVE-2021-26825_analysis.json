This leads to a smaller-than-required buffer being allocated, which subsequently causes a stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) when the image data is loaded into the undersized buffer. CWE-190 can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which is a parent of CWE-121 and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe121 secondary\n    class cwe119,cwe787 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) when calculating the buffer size. This results in allocating a buffer that is too small. When image data is written to this buffer, it overflows, leading to a **stack buffer overflow** (CWE-121). The final impact is potential code execution or a system crash.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the primary cause of the vulnerability is an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) within the `ImageLoaderTGAload_image()` function. The evidence from the vulnerability description includes: \"An **integer overflow** issue exists in Godot Engine up to v3.2 that can be triggered when loading specially crafted.TGA image files\" and \"The vulnerability exists in ImageLoaderTGAload_image() function at line const size_t buffer_size = (tga_header.image_width * tga_header.image_height) * pixel_size\". The resulting **stack buffer overflow** (CWE-121) is a consequence of the undersized buffer, caused by the integer overflow.\n\nCWE-190 is chosen as the primary CWE because it is the root cause, and the description aligns with the vulnerability details. CWE-121 is chosen as a secondary CWE because the stack buffer overflow is a direct consequence of the integer overflow. Both CWEs are at appropriate levels of specificity (Base and Variant, respectively).\n\nCWE-119 was considered but not chosen because it is a Class-level CWE and is discouraged when more specific CWEs are available. CWE-787 was considered but not chosen because the overflow is specifically stack-based. Other CWEs such as CWE-125, CWE-122, CWE-789, CWE-1284 and CWE-193 were considered, but they did not align as closely with the specific vulnerability details as CWE-190 and CWE-121.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
