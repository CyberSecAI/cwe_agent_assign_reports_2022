# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-21839

# Vulnerability Description

    Multiple exploitable **integer overflow** vulnerabilities exist within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. A specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an **integer overflow** due to **unchecked arithmetic** resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.

    ## WEAKNESS: 'integer overflow'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 768.31)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...
