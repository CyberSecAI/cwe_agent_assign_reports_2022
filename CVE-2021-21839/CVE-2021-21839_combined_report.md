# Analysis for CVE-2021-21839

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.8 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-190** (Integer Overflow or Wraparound), which occurs due to **unchecked arithmetic**. This can then lead to **CWE-122** (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) because the overflowed integer is used to allocate or copy memory. The integer overflow precedes the heap-based buffer overflow.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a specially crafted MPEG-4 input. This input leads to **unchecked arithmetic**, resulting in an **integer overflow** (**CWE-190**). The overflowed value is then used in a memory allocation or copy operation, leading to a **heap-based buffer overflow** (**CWE-122**). This ultimately causes **memory corruption**.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states the presence of an **integer overflow** due to **unchecked arithmetic**, which subsequently leads to a **heap-based buffer overflow** and **memory corruption**.

The description states: "Multiple exploitable **integer overflow** vulnerabilities exist within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. A specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an **integer overflow** due to **unchecked arithmetic** resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption."

**CWE-190** (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) is the most appropriate primary CWE because the root cause is an arithmetic calculation that exceeds the maximum value for the integer type.

**CWE-122** (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a secondary CWE because the overflowed value leads to a buffer overflow in the heap.

The graph relationships confirm that integer overflows can precede buffer overflows, reinforcing the chosen CWE mapping. The selected CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, providing a detailed representation of the weakness.

Other CWEs Considered:
*   CWE-197 (Numeric Truncation Error): Considered but not chosen as the primary CWE, since the description focuses more on the wraparound aspect of integer overflow rather than truncation.
*   CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input): Considered but not chosen because the root cause is the integer overflow that leads to the buffer overflow, not directly a missing size check.
*   CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read): Considered but not chosen since the primary issue is a write, not a read.

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

**Mapping Guidance**:
