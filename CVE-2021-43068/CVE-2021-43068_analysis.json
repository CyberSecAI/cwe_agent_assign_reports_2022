CWE-287 is a parent of CWE-1390 and represents a more general case of improper authentication. The vulnerability involves an **incorrect implementation** of the authentication algorithm, which directly maps to CWE-303. Although CWE-1390 and CWE-287 are related, CWE-303 provides the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability. I have selected CWE-303 as the primary because it is at the base level of abstraction.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe303[\"CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe303 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe303 primary\n    class cwe1390,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper authentication**, specifically the **incorrect implementation** of the authentication algorithm (CWE-303). This leads to an authentication bypass, allowing a user to bypass the second factor of authentication. The root cause is CWE-303, and the impact can be seen as a form of weak authentication (CWE-1390) or improper authentication (CWE-287) more broadly.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **improper authentication** as the root cause, leading to the bypass of the second factor of authentication. The retriever results suggested CWE-303, CWE-287, and CWE-1390 as potential candidates. Upon further review, CWE-303, \"Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm,\" was deemed the most appropriate due to its specificity and direct relevance to the vulnerability description and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states: \"An incorrect implementation of the authentication algorithm.\" The vulnerability lies in the fact that the FortiAuthenticator is not enforcing the 'Mandatory password and OTP' setting for unimported remote users during RADIUS login, effectively bypassing the second factor of authentication.\n\nCWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) are broader classifications that, while applicable, do not capture the specific nature of the vulnerability as accurately as CWE-303.\n\nI am overriding the general mapping guidance to prefer the base level CWE of CWE-303 because it more accurately reflects the **rootcause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is **incorrect**.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 3869.89\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nWhen an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable.
