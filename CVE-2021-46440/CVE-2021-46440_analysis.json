Attacker decodes the cookie to obtain the cleartext password.\n4.  **Impact:** Attacker uses the password to access API documentation and potentially perform further API attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **Storing passwords in a recoverable format** (CWE-257), as explicitly stated in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"*The vulnerability stems from the way the documentation plugin in Strapi handled authentication cookies.*\" The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-257 as the primary candidate.\n\nCWE-522 (**Insufficiently Protected Credentials**) is considered a secondary candidate because it's a more general class that includes CWE-257. The mapping guidance for CWE-522 suggests examining its children for a better fit, which in this case is CWE-257.\n\nCWE-312 (**Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information**) is considered a secondary candidate, but is less likely. The vulnerability description states that the password was obtained by decoding the cookie, suggesting that the password was not initially stored in cleartext, but became available in cleartext after the cookie was decoded.\n\nThe selection of CWE-257 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause described in the vulnerability, which is the storage of passwords in a recoverable format.",
