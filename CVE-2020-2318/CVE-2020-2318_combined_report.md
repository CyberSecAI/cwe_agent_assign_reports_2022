## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of root cause and weaknesses for the vulnerability description:
1.  Root Cause: **Unencrypted storage of sensitive information** (CWE-256)
2.  Impact: Passwords can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission and users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on identifying the most specific CWE that accurately captures the **root cause** of the vulnerability: **unencrypted storage of sensitive information**.

The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section identifies the **rootcause** as "**unencrypted storage of sensitive information**". The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** section states that the **root cause of vulnerability** is "The plugin stores passwords in plain text in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller." The **weakness** is further described as "**passwords stored unencrypted**".

The retriever results suggested CWE-256 **Plaintext Storage of a Password** as the top candidate. The description of CWE-256, "Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise," aligns directly with the vulnerability description. The **Mapping Guidance** for CWE-256 indicates **Usage: Allowed** and **Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

CWE-260 **Password in Configuration File** was also considered because the passwords are stored in `config.xml` files. It also has **Usage: Allowed** and **Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities. However, the primary weakness is the **unencrypted storage**, not the location in a configuration file. Therefore, CWE-260 is a secondary concern.

CWE-522 **Insufficiently Protected Credentials** was considered because it is a parent of both CWE-256 and CWE-260. However, it is a Class-level CWE and less specific than CWE-256. The **Mapping Guidance** for CWE-522 indicates **Usage: Allowed-with-Review** and **Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate. Therefore, CWE-522 is a secondary concern.

The hierarchical relationships between CWEs influenced the final selection. The desire for a specific, Base-level CWE led to choosing CWE-256 as the primary mapping.

CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information, CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information, CWE-311 Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data, CWE-922 Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information, CWE-497 Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere, CWE-257 Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format, CWE-538 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory, CWE-549 Missing Password Field Masking, CWE-555 J2EE Misconfiguration: Plaintext Password in Configuration File, CWE-862 Missing Authorization, CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization, CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key, CWE-178 Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity, CWE-1289 Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input, CWE-289 Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name, CWE-499 Serializable Class Containing Sensitive Data, CWE-498 Cloneable Class Containing Sensitive Information, CWE-942 Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains, CWE-433 Unparsed Raw Web Content Delivery, CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File were all considered but not selected because they are either too general, focus on related but distinct issues, or represent impacts rather than the root cause.

The final selection of CWE-256 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability: **plaintext storage of passwords**. This is a Base-level CWE, which is preferred for root cause analysis.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.

- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.
