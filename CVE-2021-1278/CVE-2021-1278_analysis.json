CWE-61 (UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following) is a Compound CWE that requires CWE-59. CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) could be a factor.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n    cwe61[\"CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n\n    cwe61 -->|REQUIREDBY| cwe59\n    cwe61 -->|REQUIRES| cwe73\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe59 primary\n    class cwe61,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient input validation**, leading to the ability to create symlinks to arbitrary files, potentially corrupting their contents, and ultimately causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n  - Root Cause: **Insufficient input validation**\n  - Weakness: Improper Link Resolution\n  - Impact: Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **insufficient input validation** as the root cause, allowing a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files owned by the root user by creating symlinks to a specific path. The primary CWE match is CWE-59, due to the **improper link resolution** aspect.\n\nThe decision is primarily based on the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states: \"The vulnerabilities are due to the absence of validation checks for the input that is used to create symlinks.\" and \"An attacker could create a symlink to a target file on a specific path, potentially corrupting the contents of the file. If the file is a critical systems file, this could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by showing that CWE-61 requires CWE-59 and CWE-73.\n\nCWE-59 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **improper link resolution** issue, which is the core weakness exploited in the vulnerability. CWE-61 is broader, and while it captures the symlink aspect, CWE-59 is more precise in describing the underlying problem.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere.
