CWE-400 is a parent of CWE-770 which addresses Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling. Given the nature of ReDoS, the resource consumption aspect (CWE-400) is a potential consequence, but the root cause is the inefficient regular expression (CWE-1333).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe407 -->|PARENT| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe407,cwe770 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **inefficient regular expression** (CWE-1333) which, when processing specific input, leads to excessive CPU consumption and results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, which falls under **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly indicates that CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity) is the most appropriate primary CWE for this vulnerability. The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** clearly states the **weakness** as \"**regular expression denial of service**\". The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** also confirms the \"**ReDoS vulnerability due to an inefficient regular expression**\" as the root cause.\n\nThe retriever results listed CWE-1333 as the top combined result with a score of 1.0. The description of CWE-1333 perfectly matches the vulnerability: \"The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\"\n\nCWE-400 is a potential secondary weakness, as the ReDoS leads to uncontrolled resource consumption and potential denial of service.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the retriever results. CWE-1333 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\nCWE-23 was not selected because the vulnerability is not related to path traversal.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\nCWE-41 was not selected because the vulnerability is not related to path equivalence.\n\n## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\nCWE-36 was not selected because the vulnerability is not related to path traversal.\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\nCWE-59 was not selected because the vulnerability is not related to link resolution.\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\nCWE-73 was not selected because the vulnerability is not related to external control of file names or paths.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\nCWE-212 was not selected because the vulnerability is not related to sensitive information removal.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\nCWE-184 was not selected because the vulnerability is not related to incomplete lists of disallowed inputs.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\nCWE-668 was not selected because it is a high-level Class and more specific CWEs are available.\n\n## CWE-24: Path Traversal: '../filedir'\nCWE-24 was not selected because the vulnerability is not related to path traversal.\n\n## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\nCWE-427 was not selected because the vulnerability is not related to uncontrolled search path elements.\n\n## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\nCWE-1333 was selected as the primary CWE.\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\nCWE-22 was not selected because the vulnerability is not related to path traversal.\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\nCWE-770 was not selected as the primary CWE because it is a consequence of the **inefficient regular expression**, but not the root cause.
