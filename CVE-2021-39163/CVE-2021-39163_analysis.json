The vulnerability involves unauthorized access to room metadata due to **incorrect** authorization checks. While a more specific Base-level CWE would be ideal, CWE-863 accurately reflects the core issue.\n\nCWE-359 (**Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor**) is a secondary CWE because the vulnerability directly leads to the exposure of sensitive room information (name, avatar, topic, number of members) to unauthorized users. CWE-359 is a ChildOf CWE-200 (**Exposure of Sensitive Information**).\n\nCWE-639 (**Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**) is considered since the attacker needs to know the Room ID, which could be considered a \"key\" that the attacker uses to gain access to the room metadata.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe359,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863), leading to **exposure of private personal information** (CWE-359). The attacker knowing the Room ID can be considered **Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key** (CWE-639).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) as the primary weakness, stemming from the **lack of proper access control** when displaying room metadata within groups. This aligns with the CVE description which explicitly states that the server was not correctly verifying user permissions.\n\nThe secondary weakness is CWE-359 (**Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor**), the impact of which is the unauthorized disclosure of room metadata.\n\nCWE-639 (**Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**) is considered since the attacker needs to know the Room ID.\n\nThe vulnerability description states, \"unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room.\" This statement directly supports the mapping to both CWE-863 and CWE-359.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is at the Class level, but it is the most accurate representation of the core issue, with the caveat that a Base-level CWE would be preferred, but no other Base-level CWEs capture the **incorrect** authorization aspect as well. CWE-359 is included to reflect the information exposure aspect.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n- Considered, but not relevant as there is no indication of XSS.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n- Considered as a secondary CWE.
