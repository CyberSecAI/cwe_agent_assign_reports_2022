|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**), which is a Class-level CWE. The vulnerability involves unauthorized access to room metadata due to **incorrect** authorization checks. While a more specific Base-level CWE would be ideal, CWE-863 accurately reflects the core issue.

CWE-359 (**Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor**) is a secondary CWE because the vulnerability directly leads to the exposure of sensitive room information (name, avatar, topic, number of members) to unauthorized users. CWE-359 is a ChildOf CWE-200 (**Exposure of Sensitive Information**).

CWE-639 (**Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**) is considered since the attacker needs to know the Room ID, which could be considered a "key" that the attacker uses to gain access to the room metadata.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863), leading to **exposure of private personal information** (CWE-359). The attacker knowing the Room ID can be considered **Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key** (CWE-639).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) as the primary weakness, stemming from the **lack of proper access control** when displaying room metadata within groups. This aligns with the CVE description which explicitly states that the server was not correctly verifying user permissions.

The secondary weakness is CWE-359 (**Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor**), the impact of which is the unauthorized disclosure of room metadata.

CWE-639 (**Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**) is considered since the attacker needs to know the Room ID.

The vulnerability description states, "unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room." This statement directly supports the mapping to both CWE-863 and CWE-359.

The selection of CWE-863 is at the Class level, but it is the most accurate representation of the core issue, with the caveat that a Base-level CWE would be preferred, but no other Base-level CWEs capture the **incorrect** authorization aspect as well. CWE-359 is included to reflect the information exposure aspect.
