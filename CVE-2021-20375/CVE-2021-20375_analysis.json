CWE-285 is a high-level Class, while CWE-863 and CWE-639 are children and more specific. Although the description is vague, the **improper access controls** root cause and the ability for an authenticated user to intercept and replace messages indicates an authorization problem. The hierarchical relationships (CWE-863 and CWE-639 are children of CWE-285 and other authorization-related CWEs) support refining the classification from the general \"Improper Access Control\" to more specific authorization issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe chain starts with **improper access controls**, leading to the ability to intercept and replace messages.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper access controls**\n  - **Weakness:** Authorization flaw\n  - **Impact:** Intercept and replace messages\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nInitially, the vulnerability description points towards a general access control issue due to \"**improper access controls**.\" The ability for an authenticated user to intercept and replace messages suggests an authorization flaw. The description lacks specifics on *how* the access control is flawed, making precise CWE selection difficult.\n\nThe retriever results point to several authorization-related CWEs, including CWE-285, CWE-863, and CWE-639. Given the limited information, I selected CWE-285 as the primary, but acknowledge that more specific CWEs (CWE-863, CWE-639) are also relevant but difficult to confirm without further information.\n\nCWE-284 (Improper Access Control) was considered but rejected because it is a very high-level Pillar, and the retriever results provide lower-level Class and Base options. CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) was considered, but the description says \"**improper** access controls\" which implies that there are access controls, just that they are not implemented correctly.\n\nCWE-285 is selected as the primary because it is a Class level CWE, and the description says \"**improper** access controls\" which implies that there are access controls, just that they are not implemented correctly.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity
