CWE-1394 is more specific and directly addresses the **rootcause**, which is the use of a default cryptographic key. CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) is a peer of CWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format) but is not as directly relevant as CWE-1394.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1394[\"CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe1394 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1392\n    cwe798 -->|PEEROF| cwe1392\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1394 primary\n    class cwe1392,cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events for this vulnerability starts with the **rootcause**, which is the use of an **undocumented default cryptographic key**. This leads to the **impact** of an attacker gaining access to the Linux system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several candidate CWEs, but after considering the detailed descriptions and relationships, CWE-1394 (Use of Default Cryptographic Key) was determined to be the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability.\n\nThe \"**rootcause: undocumented default cryptographic key**\" phrase in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section directly supports the selection of CWE-1394. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also confirms the vulnerability stems from an undocumented default cryptographic key in the Cohesity DataPlatform.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1394 is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the guidance that the selected CWE be as specific as possible.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a default cryptographic key for potentially critical functionality.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
