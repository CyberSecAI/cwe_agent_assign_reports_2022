## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-208, which is a Base level CWE. CWE-208 is related to CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy) as a child. CWE-1254 (Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity) is also a child of CWE-208, representing a more specific case where the timing discrepancy arises from the granularity of comparison logic. Therefore, CWE-1254 is a more specific version of CWE-208. CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) is connected via CANPRECEDE to CWE-208, indicating it can lead to timing discrepancies. CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) is related to cryptographic weaknesses.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **use of strncmp**, which leads to **observable timing discrepancies** during password hash comparison. This timing discrepancy can then be exploited to **recover the password hash**, potentially leading to **unauthorized access**.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified CWE-208 as the primary candidate due to the **timing leak** caused by **using strncmp** for hash comparison. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section explicitly mentions "Timing Side-Channel: Using `strncmp()` and `memcmp()` creates a timing side-channel vulnerability." This confirms the relevance of CWE-208.

CWE-1254 was considered because it represents a more specific scenario where the timing discrepancy comes from incorrect comparison logic granularity, in this case, a byte-by-byte comparison. While applicable, the description of the vulnerability doesn't explicitly focus on the granularity, making CWE-208 the more direct and appropriate choice.

CWE-916 was also considered because the advisory suggests using strong salted hashing algorithms. However, the vulnerability is primarily about the timing leak due to the use of `strncmp`, not the weakness of the hash itself. Therefore, CWE-916 is a secondary concern and less directly related to the root cause.

The final decision favors CWE-208 due to its direct alignment with the **root cause** (**timing leak** from **using strncmp**) and supporting evidence from the CVE description. The evidence provided is "The vulnerability stems from the **use of `strncmp()`** and `memcmp()` for comparing password hashes... These functions perform comparisons in a non-constant time manner." CWE-208 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately captures the core issue.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Technical Explanation**:
CWE-208 (Observable Timing Discrepancy) is the primary CWE because the core vulnerability is a timing side-channel. The **use of strncmp** for password hash comparison causes the comparison to take different amounts of time depending on how many characters match. This timing difference can be observed by an attacker and used to infer information about the password hash.
**Security Implications**: An attacker can recover the password hash by observing timing differences.
**Relationship**: ChildOf -> CWE-203.
**MITRE Mapping Guidance**: The usage is "Allowed" and the rationale states that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.

## CWE-1254: Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6521.54
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product's comparison logic is performed over a series of steps rather than across the entire string in one operation. If there is a comparison logic failure on one of these steps, the operation may be vulnerable to a timing attack that can result in the interception of the process for nefarious purposes.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Technical Explanation**:
CWE-1254 (Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity) is a secondary candidate because `strncmp` performs a byte-by-byte comparison. The timing differences arise because the comparison stops as soon as a mismatch is found.
**Security Implications**: An attacker can recover parts of the password hash by observing the timing differences in each byte comparison.
**Relationship**: ChildOf -> CWE-208, ChildOf -> CWE-697
**MITRE Mapping Guidance**: The usage is "Allowed" and the rationale states that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.

## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6995.57
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Technical Explanation**:
CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) is a secondary candidate because the advisory mentions that "the default unsalted MD5 hash is easily cracked offline". The fact that an easily cracked hash is being used contributes to the weakness. However, the root cause is still the timing leak due to **using strncmp**.
**Security Implications**: It can make it easier to crack passwords.
**Relationship**: ChildOf -> CWE-327, ChildOf -> CWE-328
**MITRE Mapping Guidance**: The usage is "Allowed" and the rationale states that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.

## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6782.01
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Technical Explanation**:
CWE-328 is closely related to CWE-916, and could be a better fit if the primary issue was a weak hashing algorithm. However, the primary weakness is the timing side channel, not the hash itself, even though it is mentioned that an unsalted MD5 hash is used by default.
**Security Implications**: Using a weak hash makes it easier to crack passwords.
**Relationship**: ChildOf -> CWE-326, Child

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-37848

## Vulnerability Description
common/password.c in Pengutronix barebox through 2021.07.0 leaks timing information because strncmp is used during hash comparison.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** leaks timing information
- **product:** Pengutronix barebox
- **version:** through 2021.07.0
- **component:** common/password.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37848:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of `strncmp()` and `memcmp()` for comparing password hashes and cryptographic signatures, respectively. These functions perform comparisons in a non-constant time manner.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Timing Side-Channel:** Using `strncmp()` and `memcmp()` creates a timing side-channel vulnerability. The comparison functions will exit early if a mismatch is found. By measuring the time it takes for the comparison to complete, an attacker can potentially infer information about the password hash or signature, byte by byte. This is because comparison will take longer the more bytes are correct.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Password Hash Recovery:** By timing the `strncmp()` comparison of the entered password with the stored hash, an attacker can gradually recover the stored hash. While the hash is assumed uncrackable, the exposure makes it vulnerable, especially if weak hashing algorithms are in use.
*   **Signature Forgery:** By timing the `memcmp()` comparison for signed state variables, an attacker could forge the signature byte-by-byte, ultimately bypassing secure boot mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local or Network Access:**  An attacker with the ability to interact with the bootloader and input passwords or manipulate state variables can exploit the timing side-channel vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Interact with the Bootloader:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the barebox bootloader, either through direct access or potentially over a network.
*  **Precise Timing:** The attacker needs to be able to measure the execution time of the comparison functions with sufficient precision to infer information about the secret data.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by replacing `strncmp()` and `memcmp()` with a constant-time comparison function called `crypto_memneq()`.
*   The advisory specifically mentions that the default unsalted MD5 hash is easily cracked offline, and strong salted hashing algorithms like PBKDF2 along with a robust password (e.g. >20 characters) is advised.
*   The vulnerability described in this context is a timing side-channel vulnerability that could weaken otherwise strong cryptographic primitives.

The provided content gives a more detailed technical explanation of the vulnerability and how it could be exploited than is present in the basic CVE description.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

### Extended Description
In security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.

**[Maintenance]** CWE 4.16 removed a demonstrative example for a hardware module because it was inaccurate and unable to be adapted. The CWE team is developing an alternative.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies
- **CVE-2019-10482:** Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels
- **CVE-2014-0984:** Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.




## CWE-1254: Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product's comparison logic is performed over a series of steps rather than across the entire string in one operation. If there is a comparison logic failure on one of these steps, the operation may be vulnerable to a timing attack that can result in the interception of the process for nefarious purposes.

### Extended Description


Comparison logic is used to compare a variety of objects including passwords, Message Authentication Codes (MACs), and responses to verification challenges. When comparison logic is implemented at a finer granularity (e.g., byte-by-byte comparison) and breaks in the case of a comparison failure, an attacker can exploit this implementation to identify when exactly the failure occurred. With multiple attempts, the attacker may be able to guesses the correct password/response to challenge and elevate their privileges.

## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

### Extended Description


A hash function is defined as an algorithm that maps arbitrarily sized data into a fixed-sized digest (output) such that the following properties hold:


  1. The algorithm is not invertible (also called "one-way" or "not reversible")

  1. The algorithm is deterministic; the same input produces the same digest every time

 Building on this definition, a cryptographic hash function must also ensure that a malicious actor cannot leverage the hash function to have a reasonable chance of success at determining any of the following:

  1. the original input (preimage attack), given only the digest

  1. another input that can produce the same digest (2nd preimage attack), given the original input

  1. a set of two or more inputs that evaluate to the same digest (birthday attack), given the actor can arbitrarily choose the inputs to be hashed and can do so a reasonable amount of times

What is regarded as "reasonable" varies by context and threat model, but in general, "reasonable" could cover any attack that is more efficient than brute force (i.e., on average, attempting half of all possible combinations). Note that some attacks might be more efficient than brute force but are still not regarded as achievable in the real world.

Any algorithm that does not meet the above conditions will generally be considered weak for general use in hashing.


In addition to algorithmic weaknesses, a hash function can be made weak by using the hash in a security context that breaks its security guarantees. For example, using a hash function without a salt for storing passwords (that are sufficiently short) could enable an adversary to create a "rainbow table" [REF-637] to recover the password under certain conditions; this attack works against such hash functions as MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries including CWE-328 have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.

- **CVE-2020-25685:** DNS product uses a weak hash (CRC32 or SHA-1) of the query name, allowing attacker to forge responses by computing domain names with the same hash.




## CWE-597: Use of Wrong Operator in String Comparison
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses the wrong operator when comparing a string, such as using "==" when the .equals() method should be used instead.

### Extended Description
In Java, using == or != to compare two strings for equality actually compares two objects for equality rather than their string values for equality. Chances are good that the two references will never be equal. While this weakness often only affects program correctness, if the equality is used for a security decision, the unintended comparison result could be leveraged to affect program security.

## CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison
**Abstraction:** Pillar
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product compares two entities in a security-relevant context, but the comparison is incorrect, which may lead to resultant weaknesses.

### Extended Description


This Pillar covers several possibilities:


  - the comparison checks one factor incorrectly;

  - the comparison should consider multiple factors, but it does not check at least one of those factors at all;

  - the comparison checks the wrong factor.



### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
None

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, sometimes this weakness is forced to be used due to the lack of in-depth weakness research. See Research Gaps.
**Comments:** Where feasible, consider children or descendants of this entry instead.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Research Gap]** 

Weaknesses related to this Pillar appear to be under-studied, especially with respect to classification schemes. Input from academic and other communities could help identify and resolve gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE.


**[Maintenance]** This entry likely has some relationships with case sensitivity (CWE-178), but case sensitivity is a factor in other types of weaknesses besides comparison. Also, in cryptography, certain attacks are possible when certain comparison operations do not take place in constant time, causing a timing-related information leak (CWE-208).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)
- **CVE-2020-15811:** Chain: Proxy uses a substring search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header (CWE-697), allowing request splitting (CWE-113) and cache poisoning
- **CVE-2016-10003:** Proxy performs incorrect comparison of request headers, leading to infoleak




## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

### Extended Description


Many password storage mechanisms compute a hash and store the hash, instead of storing the original password in plaintext. In this design, authentication involves accepting an incoming password, computing its hash, and comparing it to the stored hash.


Many hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. However, this efficiency is a problem for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker's workload for brute-force password cracking. If an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method (such as SQL injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by computing hashes efficiently. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing (such as cloud computing) and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware. In such a scenario, an efficient hash algorithm helps the attacker.


There are several properties of a hash scheme that are relevant to its strength against an offline, massively-parallel attack:


  - The amount of CPU time required to compute the hash ("stretching")

  - The amount of memory required to compute the hash ("memory-hard" operations)

  - Including a random value, along with the password, as input to the hash computation ("salting")

  - Given a hash, there is no known way of determining an input (e.g., a password) that produces this hash value, other than by guessing possible inputs ("one-way" hashing)

  - Relative to the number of all possible hashes that can be generated by the scheme, there is a low likelihood of producing the same hash for multiple different inputs ("collision resistance")

Note that the security requirements for the product may vary depending on the environment and the value of the passwords. Different schemes might not provide all of these properties, yet may still provide sufficient security for the environment. Conversely, a solution might be very strong in preserving one property, which still being very weak for an attack against another property, or it might not be able to significantly reduce the efficiency of a massively-parallel attack.

- **CVE-2008-4905:** Blogging software uses a hard-coded salt when calculating a password hash.




## CWE-385: Covert Timing Channel
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Covert timing channels convey information by modulating some aspect of system behavior over time, so that the program receiving the information can observe system behavior and infer protected information.

### Extended Description


In some instances, knowing when data is transmitted between parties can provide a malicious user with privileged information. Also, externally monitoring the timing of operations can potentially reveal sensitive data. For example, a cryptographic operation can expose its internal state if the time it takes to perform the operation varies, based on the state.


Covert channels are frequently classified as either storage or timing channels. Some examples of covert timing channels are the system's paging rate, the time a certain transaction requires to execute, and the time it takes to gain access to a shared bus.

As a result of that work, this entry might change in CWE 4.10.






## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30273:** SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity
- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.
- **CVE-2008-3775:** Product uses "ROT-25" to obfuscate the password in the registry.




## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.

### Extended Description
This issue frequently occurs during authentication, where a difference in failed-login messages could allow an attacker to determine if the username is valid or not. These exposures can be inadvertent (bug) or intentional (design).
