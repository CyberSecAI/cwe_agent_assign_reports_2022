CWE-208 is related to CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy) as a child. CWE-1254 (Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity) is also a child of CWE-208, representing a more specific case where the timing discrepancy arises from the granularity of comparison logic. Therefore, CWE-1254 is a more specific version of CWE-208. CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) is connected via CANPRECEDE to CWE-208, indicating it can lead to timing discrepancies. CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) is related to cryptographic weaknesses.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe208[\"CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe1254[\"CWE-1254: Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n\n    cwe208 -->|CHILDOF| cwe203\n    cwe1254 -->|CHILDOF| cwe208\n    cwe327 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe208\n    cwe916 -->|PEEROF|cwe327\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe208 primary\n    class cwe1254,cwe327,cwe916 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of strncmp**, which leads to **observable timing discrepancies** during password hash comparison. This timing discrepancy can then be exploited to **recover the password hash**, potentially leading to **unauthorized access**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-208 as the primary candidate due to the **timing leak** caused by **using strncmp** for hash comparison. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section explicitly mentions \"Timing Side-Channel: Using `strncmp()` and `memcmp()` creates a timing side-channel vulnerability.\" This confirms the relevance of CWE-208.\n\nCWE-1254 was considered because it represents a more specific scenario where the timing discrepancy comes from incorrect comparison logic granularity, in this case, a byte-by-byte comparison. While applicable, the description of the vulnerability doesn't explicitly focus on the granularity, making CWE-208 the more direct and appropriate choice.\n\nCWE-916 was also considered because the advisory suggests using strong salted hashing algorithms. However, the vulnerability is primarily about the timing leak due to the use of `strncmp`, not the weakness of the hash itself. Therefore, CWE-916 is a secondary concern and less directly related to the root cause.\n\nThe final decision favors CWE-208 due to its direct alignment with the **root cause** (**timing leak** from **using strncmp**) and supporting evidence from the CVE description. The evidence provided is \"The vulnerability stems from the **use of `strncmp()`** and `memcmp()` for comparing password hashes... These functions perform comparisons in a non-constant time manner.\" CWE-208 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately captures the core issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Technical Explanation**:\nCWE-208 (Observable Timing Discrepancy) is the primary CWE because the core vulnerability is a timing side-channel. The **use of strncmp** for password hash comparison causes the comparison to take different amounts of time depending on how many characters match.

The fact that an easily cracked hash is being used contributes to the weakness. However, the root cause is still the timing leak due to **using strncmp**.\n**Security Implications**: It can make it easier to crack passwords.\n**Relationship**: ChildOf -> CWE-327, ChildOf -> CWE-328\n**MITRE Mapping Guidance**: The usage is \"Allowed\" and the rationale states that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6782.01\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Technical Explanation**:\nCWE-328 is closely related to CWE-916, and could be a better fit if the primary issue was a weak hashing algorithm.
