Since the vulnerability specifically involves **command injection** in an OS command, the more specific CWE-78 was chosen over its parent CWE-77. While both apply, CWE-78 provides a more precise characterization of the weakness. There is also a peer relationship between CWE-78 and CWE-88 (Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters), but there's no evidence to suggest argument injection is involved. The vulnerability description explicitly indicates **command injection** by an authenticated user, supporting the selection of a **command injection** related CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: OS Command Injection\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Command Injection\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe77 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n    class cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the following sequence:\n1.  Improper handling of external input when constructing an OS command (CWE-78).\n2.  The ability for an authenticated user to inject commands.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly pointed towards **command injection**, supported by the **Vulnerability Description** and the **CWE for similar CVE Descriptions**. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-77 and CWE-78 as top candidates. The final decision to select CWE-78 was based on the explicit mention of an OS command in the vulnerability, making it a more specific and accurate representation of the weakness compared to the more general CWE-77. The evidence provided explicitly identifies \"**command injection** by an authenticated user,\" solidifying the choice of a **command injection** related CWE. The graph relationships further guided the selection of CWE-78 as a child of CWE-77, representing a more specific type of **command injection**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**command injection** by an authenticated user,\" providing direct evidence.\n- CWE-78 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n- CWE-78's description aligns perfectly with the vulnerability: \"The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input...but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command...\"\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n- CWE-77: While also related to **command injection**, it's a more general Class-level CWE. Since the vulnerability specifically involves an OS command, CWE-78 is a better fit.\n- CWE-74: Too general, representing a high-level \"Injection\" weakness. The vulnerability is more specific than a general injection issue.\n- CWE-94: \"Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\" - This is a different type of injection related to generating code, and this vulnerability isn't generating code.",
