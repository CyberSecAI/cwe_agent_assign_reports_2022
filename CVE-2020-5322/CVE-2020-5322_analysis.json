The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section explicitly mentions \"**command injection**\" as a **weakness**, and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the **root cause** is a **command injection** flaw. Given that the vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary *shell* commands, CWE-78, \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\" is the most appropriate primary CWE. The description of CWE-78 aligns perfectly with the vulnerability: \"The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input..., but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command...\"\n\nCWE-77, \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\" was considered as a broader, more general case of command injection, but because the vulnerability specifically mentions \"shell commands\" or \"OS commands\", CWE-78 is more specific and accurate. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-78 states: \"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\"\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description and the content summary is sufficient to confidently classify this vulnerability as CWE-78.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE was not selected because it does not describe the root cause of the vulnerability, which is command injection.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE was considered, but it is a more general class of injection vulnerabilities. Since the vulnerability specifically involves OS commands, CWE-78 is a more precise match.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE doesn't fit the vulnerability. The issue is not with an incomplete list of disallowed inputs, but rather with the improper handling of special elements within the input.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE does not describe the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE does not describe the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-912: Hidden Functionality\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 9500.98\n**Source**: sparse\nThis CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability, which involves command injection, not cross-site scripting.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 9449.75\n**Source**: sparse\nThis CWE is not the primary issue, as the root cause is the lack of proper neutralization of special elements in OS commands, not encoding or escaping.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 9333.00\n**Source**: sparse\nThis is a more general class, and CWE-78 is a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 9243.84\n**Source**: sparse\nThis could be a secondary weakness if argument delimiters are not properly handled. However, the primary issue is that special elements are not neutralized in the OS command.\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 9174.44\n**Source**: sparse\nThis CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n**Source**: graph\n**Description**:\nCWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\nThis is the selected CWE.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n**Source**: graph\nThis CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\nThis CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\nThis CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\nThis CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\nThis CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 3.89\n**Source**: graph\nThis CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 3.64\n**Source**: graph\nThis CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-1",
