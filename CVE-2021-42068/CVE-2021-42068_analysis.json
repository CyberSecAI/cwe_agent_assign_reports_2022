The relationship indicates that CWE-787 is a specific type of memory buffer issue. CWE-119 is more general. I am choosing CWE-787 as the root cause because it specifically states that the write is happening out of bounds.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is as follows:\n1.  A manipulated GIF file is opened.\n2.  The application attempts to process the malformed GIF data.\n3.  Due to **improper** or **insufficient** bounds checking when processing the GIF data, the application writes data past the end of the intended buffer (CWE-787).\n4.  The application crashes due to the memory corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment was to use CWE-787 as the primary CWE because the application crashes due to writing past the end of the intended buffer.\n\nThe evidence is based on the vulnerability description, which states that the application crashes when opening a manipulated GIF file. The **root cause** is likely due to **improper** handling of the malformed GIF data, leading to an out-of-bounds write. The description states \"When a user opens a manipulated GIF (.gif) file received from untrusted sources in SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer - version 9.0, the application crashes\".\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by providing a clear hierarchy where CWE-787 is a specific type of CWE-119.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-787 accurately describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability, while CWE-119 provides a broader context.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect
