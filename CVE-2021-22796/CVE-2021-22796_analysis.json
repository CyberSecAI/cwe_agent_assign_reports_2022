While it is discouraged to map to class-level CWEs when more specific options exist, the provided description lacks the detail to select a more specific base or variant. CWE-434 **Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type** is a base-level CWE, which can be related to the exploit vector. CWE-287 is a parent of CWE-290 **Authentication Bypass by Spoofing**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe290[\"CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\"]\n    \n    cwe290 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe434 -->|PEEROF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe434 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Authentication** (CWE-287), which allows a malicious file to be uploaded (**Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type** - CWE-434), leading to remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states the **rootcause** as **Improper Authentication**, which is the primary reason for selecting CWE-287. The vulnerability description states: \"A CWE-287 **Improper Authentication** vulnerability exists that could allow remote code execution when a malicious file is uploaded.\" The retriever results also listed CWE-287 as the top candidate. While CWE-287 is a class-level CWE and the guidance discourages using it, the description doesn't provide enough detail to choose a more specific CWE. The malicious file upload vector strongly suggests CWE-434 **Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type** as a secondary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not applicable.
