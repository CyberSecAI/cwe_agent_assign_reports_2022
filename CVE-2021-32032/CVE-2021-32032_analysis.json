CWE-401 is a Variant of CWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release) and CWE-772 (Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime). Given the specific nature of the vulnerability being a **memory leak**, CWE-401 is the most specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    cwe772[\"CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    \n    cwe401 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    cwe401 -->|CHILDOF| cwe772\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe401 primary\n    class cwe404,cwe772 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an unnecessary cleanup step in a multi-part cryptographic operation. This **premature cleanup** prevents the underlying cryptographic library from releasing internal resources, leading to the **memory leak**. The final impact is potential resource exhaustion.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **memory leak** aspect of the vulnerability described in the Vulnerability Description. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirmed the **root cause** as an \"Unnecessary multi-part operation cleanup in Crypto module\" that leads to a \"**memory leak**\".\n\nThe Retriever Results also indicated that CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) was the top candidate.\n\nThe description of CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) states: \"The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.\" This aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description. The CWE specification also lists \"Memory Leak\" as an alternative term, further solidifying the choice.\n\nBased on the evidence, relationships, and mapping guidance, CWE-401 is the most appropriate and specific CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
