The variant CWE-122 is also a child of the class CWE-119. CWE-119 is a general class describing memory buffer issues, whereas CWE-787 and CWE-122 describe the specific out-of-bounds write. CWE-122 specifies that the buffer is on the heap.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe122 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **heap buffer overflow**, which leads to an out-of-bounds write, resulting in local information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates a **heap buffer overflow** that leads to an out-of-bounds write. This is supported by the key phrases \"heap buffer overflow\" and \"out of bounds write\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary does not give any contradicting information.\n\nThe initial assessment identifies CWE-787 as the primary weakness, due to the explicit mention of an out-of-bounds write, which is a base CWE and thus more specific than the class CWE-119. Given the mention of a \"heap buffer overflow\" in the description, CWE-122 is also included as a secondary candidate because it's a variant of CWE-787 that specifies the overflow occurs on the heap.\n\nCWE-119 is considered but ultimately classified as secondary because, while applicable, it is a more general class and the description provides enough information to pinpoint the more specific CWE-787. The mapping guidance for CWE-119 even suggests to \"Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-787 capturing the root cause and CWE-122 providing further detail about the memory allocation location of the buffer.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
