While both could apply, CWE-862 is more specific. There are no clear chain relationships indicated in the retriever results or vulnerability description. CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is a peer that was considered because it could be a potential secondary weakness but was ultimately deemed less relevant as the primary issue is access control.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 --o|PEEROF| cwe201\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a **missing access control** check on the web service, leading to unauthorized viewing of other users' enrolled courses. The root cause is the **missing authorization**, and the impact is information exposure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states that the web service \"did not validate that the requesting user had permission to view that information.\" This directly points to an authorization issue. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this with the statement \"Missing access control validation in the web service for fetching enrolled courses.\"\n\nThe retriever results highlighted several potential CWEs, including CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization). Given the explicit mention of **missing access control**, CWE-862 is the most accurate and specific choice. While CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is a parent of CWE-862, it is less specific. The mapping guidance for CWE-285 even suggests considering its children, such as CWE-862.\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) was considered because the impact involves viewing sensitive information. However, the root cause is not about inserting sensitive information, but rather about failing to restrict access to it. Therefore, CWE-201 is a less relevant secondary concern.\n\nThe final decision is to assign CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as the primary CWE, with high confidence due to the direct evidence in the vulnerability description and supporting information in the CVE reference. The abstraction level of Class is appropriate because there are no more specific Base or Variant level CWEs that apply.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
