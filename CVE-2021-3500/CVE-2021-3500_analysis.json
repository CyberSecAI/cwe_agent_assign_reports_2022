Matches the vulnerability description of a **stack overflow** due to a crafted file. |\n| CWE-674 | Uncontrolled Recursion | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE. Matches the description of recursive file opening. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), which is a variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) is considered as a secondary CWE, since the root cause indicates recursive file opening without proper cycle breaking which leads to stack exhaustion. It is a child of CWE-834 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption). These relationships help clarify the nature of the vulnerability and confirm the relevance of the selected CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe674 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe674 secondary\n    class cwe787,cwe119,cwe834 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the crafted djvu file leading to recursive file opening without proper cycle breaking resulting in a **stack overflow**, which leads to application crash.\n  - Root Cause: Crafted djvu file, recursive file opening.\n  - Weakness: **Stack overflow**\n  - Impact: Application crash\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the provided evidence, specifically the \"**stack overflow**\" vulnerability description key phrase and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which mentioned \"recursive file opening without proper cycle breaking.\" The **Retriever Results** indicated CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) as the top combined result, which aligns well with the vulnerability description. The analysis considered CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) as a secondary weakness, because the crafted file leads to recursive calls that are not properly controlled.\n\nThe relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), which is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). This hierarchy supports the selection of CWE-121 as the most specific and relevant CWE.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence of a **stack overflow** caused by a crafted djvu file due to recursive file opening.
