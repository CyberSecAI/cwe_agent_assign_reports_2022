The secondary CWEs, CWE-565 and CWE-614, relate to cookie handling. CWE-565 is a broader issue of reliance on cookies without proper validation, while CWE-614 focuses on the missing 'Secure' attribute in HTTPS sessions, which relates to secure transmission.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe459[\"CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Shutdown or Release of Resource\"]\n    cwe565[\"CWE-565: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking\"]\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n\n    cwe459 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    cwe565 -->|RELATED| cwe459\n    cwe614 -->|RELATED| cwe459\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe459 primary\n    class cwe565,cwe614 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to properly clean up** the server-side session after a user logs out (**CWE-459**). This leads to a situation where the session remains active on the server, even though the client-side cookies are deleted. If an attacker can then obtain and reuse the session identifier, they can gain unauthorized access.\n  - **Root Cause:** **CWE-459** Incomplete Cleanup (server-side session not invalidated)\n  - **Weakness:** Session remains active server-side\n  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access if session identifier is compromised\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **root cause**, which is the **client side cookies not being deleted** and the session remains valid on the server side for reuse, leading to potential privilege escalation. The primary CWE selected is CWE-459 (Incomplete Cleanup), because the **server-side session isn't properly terminated** when a user logs out, representing a **failure to properly clean up resources** after use. This aligns with the vulnerability description and key phrases.\n\nThe Retriever Results also suggested considering CWE-565 (Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking) and CWE-614 (Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute). While relevant, these are secondary because they focus more on cookie handling, whereas the **root cause** is the **server-side session management**.\n\nThe relationship analysis shows that CWE-459 is a child of CWE-404 (Improper Shutdown or Release of Resource), indicating that it's a specific type of resource management issue. The additional CWEs selected relate to handling of cookies.\n\nOverall, the selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **root cause** and contributing factors to the vulnerability, as supported by the evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links. The highest confidence is assigned to CWE-459 because it best captures the **incomplete cleanup** aspect of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe
