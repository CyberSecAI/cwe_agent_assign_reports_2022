It can precede CWE-94. The secondary CWE, CWE-79, is a base CWE. The choice of CWE-98 is based on the explicit mention of **remote file inclusion** in the vulnerability description, making it a more specific and accurate classification than its parent CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe98[\"CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')\"]\n    cwe706[\"CWE-706: Use of Multiple Unprotected Resources\"]\n    cwe829[\"CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe98 -->|CHILDOF| cwe706\n    cwe98 -->|CHILDOF| cwe829\n    cwe98 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe94\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe98 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n    class cwe706,cwe829,cwe94 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **remote file inclusion** (CWE-98), which allows an attacker to inject HTML into a page, leading to potential cross-site scripting (CWE-79).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**remote file inclusion**,\" which strongly suggests CWE-98. The retriever results also support this, with CWE-98 being the top combined result.\n\nThe secondary consideration was whether the injection of HTML leads to XSS. Since the description states that the attacker can \"inject attacker supplied html into a page,\" CWE-79 becomes a relevant secondary concern, representing the impact of the **remote file inclusion**.\n\nThe final decision to prioritize CWE-98 is based on the explicit mention of \"**remote file inclusion**\" in the vulnerability description: \"A **remote file inclusion** vulnerability in the ArcGIS Server help documentation may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to inject attacker supplied html into a page.\" This is direct evidence that aligns with the core characteristics of CWE-98. The relationship data further supports this, showing that CWE-98 can lead to code injection (CWE-94), which could manifest as the ability to inject arbitrary HTML. CWE-98 is a Variant level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe PHP application receives input from an upstream component, but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the input before its usage in \"require,\" \"include,\" or similar functions.\n\n### Extended Description\nIn certain versions and configurations of PHP, this can allow an attacker to specify a URL to a remote location from which the product will obtain the code to execute. In other cases in association with path traversal, the attacker can specify a local file that may contain executable statements that can be parsed by PHP.",
