CWE-770 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability, focusing on the allocation aspect, which aligns with the vulnerability description stating \"**insufficient management of available filesystem resources**\".\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe665[\"CWE-665: Improper Control of Resource Identifiers\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe665\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient management of available filesystem resources** (CWE-770), leading to an attacker being able to exhaust filesystem resources by uploading files. The exhaustion of resources leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nMy analysis is based on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The description states the vulnerability is due to the \"**insufficient management of available filesystem resources**\". The CVE reference summary confirms that the root cause is \"**insufficient management of available filesystem resources**\" and that an attacker can exhaust filesystem resources by uploading files, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n\nThe retriever results also support this analysis, with CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) being the top match. The mapping guidance for CWE-770 states that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level for mapping root causes.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was also considered, but CWE-770 is a more specific child that better describes the **allocation** aspect of the vulnerability. The mapping guidance for CWE-400 discourages its use when lower-level CWEs are available.\n\nTherefore, CWE-770 is the most appropriate CWE because it accurately reflects the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **insufficient management of available filesystem resources** leading to resource exhaustion.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
