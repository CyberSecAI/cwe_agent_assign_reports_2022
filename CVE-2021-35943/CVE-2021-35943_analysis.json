CWE-798 is a more specific instance of using weak credentials, which is a subclass of improper authentication. CWE-287 is a parent of CWE-1390, and CWE-1390 is a parent of CWE-798. The evidence shows an **incorrect access control** because the system allows externally managed users to set an empty password, which is akin to a **hard-coded credential** that is easily bypassed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe798 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of vulnerabilities starts with the **incorrect access control**, which leads to the ability to use an empty password which can be seen as a **hard-coded credential**, and ultimately results in unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards a general authentication or authorization issue. However, after reviewing the details, specifically the ability to use an empty password, the root cause seems to be closer to using a default or hard-coded credential. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **incorrect access control** and the CVE summary states \"Externally managed users are not prevented from using an empty password\".\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-798, CWE-1392 and other weak credential/authentication CWEs.\n\nThe final decision to select CWE-798 is based on the fact that an empty password is akin to a default password that is not being changed, which effectively becomes a **hard-coded credential**. This selection provides a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability compared to the broader CWE-287.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains **hard-coded credentials**, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Considered but not Used:\n\n*   **CWE-287 Improper Authentication:** This was considered, but it is too high-level. The issue is not simply that authentication is broken, but more specifically that a trivially bypassable credential is being used. The MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-287 when more specific CWEs are available, so it was rejected as the primary CWE. It is still a secondary candidate, since it represents a valid, if more general, view of the vulnerability.\n*   **CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function:** While related, the vulnerability is not that authentication is missing entirely, but rather that the authentication mechanism is weak, allowing an empty password.\n*   **CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key:** This CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability doesn't involve bypassing authorization through a user-controlled key.\n*   **CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization:** Similar to CWE-287, this is too high-level. While authorization might be affected, the root cause is a weak authentication mechanism.\n*   **CWE-1390 Weak Authentication:** It is applicable, however CWE-798 describes a more specific case of weak authentication.\n*   **CWE-842 Placement of User into Incorrect Group:** This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability doesn't involve placing users into incorrect groups.\n*   **CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration:** This CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability description.\n*   **CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials:** While related to the concept of weak authentication, this CWE is more about how credentials are stored or transmitted, not about the credential itself being weak.\n*   **CWE-284 Improper Access Control:** This CWE is too high-level and is discouraged by MITRE.\n*   **CWE-1392 Use of Default Credentials:** While close, an empty password is not precisely a 'default' credential in the traditional sense. It's more like a lack of a credential, which aligns better with a hard-coded or easily bypassed credential.",
