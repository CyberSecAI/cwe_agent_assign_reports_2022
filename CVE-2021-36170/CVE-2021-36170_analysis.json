The vulnerability involves the **insertion of sensitive information (FortiCloud credentials) into a log file**, making CWE-532 the more specific and appropriate choice compared to its parent, CWE-200, which is a more general **exposure of sensitive information**. CWE-532 directly addresses the action of writing sensitive data to a log.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe538\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe538 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **root cause** of storing FortiCloud credentials in cleartext, leading to the **weakness** of the credentials being present in the log files. This results in the **impact** of an authenticated attacker being able to read those credentials.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly supports CWE-532 as the primary mapping. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly states that \"FortiCloud credentials used for trial license activation are stored in cleartext in log files.\" This aligns directly with CWE-532's description: \"The product writes sensitive information to a log file.\" The vulnerability description also mentions that an authenticated attacker can \"read the FortiCloud credentials...in cleartext,\" confirming the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nCWE-200 was considered but deemed less specific. While it's true that sensitive information is exposed, the root cause is the insertion of this information into the log file, making CWE-532 a more precise characterization of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-532 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the core issue: the **insertion of sensitive information into a log file**. It's a Base level CWE, which is preferred, and accurately reflects the vulnerability's root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
