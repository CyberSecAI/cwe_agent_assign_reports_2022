The vulnerability involves assigning permissions in a way that exposes sensitive information, aligning with CWE-732. CWE-359 further specifies this as exposure of private personal information. CWE-863 is related as the **incorrect** permission assignment leads to **incorrect authorization**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe359,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of root cause and weaknesses includes:\n  - **Root Cause:** **Incorrect data type for permission checks**.\n  - **Weakness:** Incorrect permission assignment leading to inadequate access control.\n  - **Impact:** Exposure of e-mail addresses and other sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **incorrect data type for permission checks** leading to information exposure. The primary CWE, CWE-732, captures the essence of **incorrect permission assignment** for a critical resource, which in this case, is user data. The description mentions that \"permission checks use an **incorrect data type**,\" directly supporting this classification.\n\nCWE-732 is chosen because the vulnerability lies in how permissions were configured (using an **incorrect data type**), allowing unauthorized access. This is more precise than simply stating a missing authorization check (CWE-862) or improper authorization (CWE-285), although both are related.\n\nThe selection of CWE-732 is further supported by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which states, \"**Inadequate Access Control:** The `checkPermissions` function was not properly enforcing access restrictions, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive user information (email addresses).\"\n\nCWE-359 is included to explicitly state the exposure of private personal information.\n\nCWE-863 is included as secondary because the permissions check was done using the wrong data type which resulted in **Incorrect Authorization**\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" combined with the hierarchical relationships and mapping guidance provided by MITRE. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear and accurate representation of the vulnerability.",
