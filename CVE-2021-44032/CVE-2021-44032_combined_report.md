## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the CWE selection was the direct match of CWE-757 to the vulnerability description, specifically the **downgrade** of the authentication method. The vulnerability description clearly states that the system **does not check if the authentication method specified in a connection request is allowed**, leading to a bypass by using a **downgraded no authentication method**. This aligns with CWE-757's description of supporting interaction between actors and allowing negotiation of which algorithm should be used, but **not selecting the strongest algorithm that is available to both parties.** CWE-288 was considered as a secondary option because the attacker leverages an alternate path (no authentication) to bypass the intended authentication mechanism.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing check** on the authentication method. This leads to the **downgrade** to no authentication, which allows the attacker to **bypass** the captive portal authentication, resulting in **unauthorized network access**.
- **Root Cause:** **Missing check** for allowed authentication method (partially captured by CWE-757, more directly described by CWE-288, but less specific).
- **Weakness:** **Downgrade** to no authentication (CWE-757).
- **Impact:** **Bypass** of authentication, leading to unauthorized access.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-757 because the root cause involves the selection of a less secure "no authentication" method during the authentication process. The evidence for this is highlighted in the vulnerability description, which states that the software **does not check if the authentication method specified in a connection request is allowed**. Further supporting evidence comes from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which details how the API accepts the "no-authentication" method (authType=0), even when not configured.

CWE-288 was considered as a secondary factor, as the attacker essentially utilizes an alternate "no authentication" path to bypass the expected authentication process. However, CWE-757 is more specific to the algorithm downgrade aspect of the vulnerability.

The CWEs are selected at the base level of abstraction for accuracy.

The final decision is based on the explicit evidence that the system allows a **downgraded authentication method**, making CWE-757 the most appropriate primary classification.

- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** TP-Link Omada SDN Software Controller
- **version:** before 5.0.15

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44032:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the TP-Link Omada SDN Controller's captive portal API. It fails to properly check if the specified authentication method is enabled. Specifically, the API accepts the "no-authentication" method (authType=0) even when it's not configured in the controller's settings, allowing unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the configured authentication mechanisms of the captive portal.
- **Missing Server-Side Validation:** The API lacks proper server-side validation to ensure the requested authentication method is actually enabled in the controller settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Network Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the captive portal's authentication and gain access to the protected network (either LAN or Wi-Fi).
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Once inside the network, the attacker can perform further malicious activities, such as reconnaissance, data exfiltration, or launching attacks against other devices in the network.
- **Compromised Traceability:** Bypassing authentication makes it harder to track the attacker's activity within the network, as the user's identity cannot be determined.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs access to the network protected by the captive portal (LAN or Wi-Fi) to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic Network Knowledge:** No specific technical expertise is needed; the exploit is fairly straightforward.
- **Access to Captive Portal:** The attacker must be able to reach the captive portal login page.
- **Browser Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to use the browser’s developer tools or an intercepting proxy to modify the authentication request.

**Detailed Explanation of Exploitation:**

1.  **Direct Browser Manipulation:**
    *   The attacker opens the captive portal login page in a web browser.
    *   Using the browser's JavaScript console (usually by pressing F12), the attacker sets the `window.authType` variable to `0`. This forces the login page to use the "no authentication" method.
    *   The attacker submits the login form without entering any credentials.
    *   The API, due to its vulnerability, grants network access.
2.  **Interception Proxy Manipulation:**
    *   Alternatively, the attacker can use an interception proxy tool (like Burp Suite) to intercept the request to `/portal/getPortalPageSetting`.
    *   The attacker then modifies the received JSON response to set the `authType` value to `0` before forwarding it to the client.
    *   This forces the client-side JavaScript to use the "no authentication" method.
    *   The attacker can now proceed to access the network.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was found in TP-Link Omada Software Controller version 4.4.4 (Windows).
- TP-Link released a fix for the vulnerability in version 5.0.15.
- The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed.

In summary, CVE-2021-44032 allows attackers to bypass the captive portal's authentication on TP-Link Omada SDN Controllers by forcing the usage of the "no authentication" method, which the API improperly accepts. This provides unauthorized network access and can lead to further malicious activity.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
A protocol or its implementation supports interaction between multiple actors and allows those actors to negotiate which algorithm should be used as a protection mechanism such as encryption or authentication, but it does not select the strongest algorithm that is available to both parties.

### Extended Description
When a security mechanism can be forced to downgrade to use a less secure algorithm, this can make it easier for attackers to compromise the product by exploiting weaker algorithm. The victim might not be aware that the less secure algorithm is being used. For example, if an attacker can force a communications channel to use cleartext instead of strongly-encrypted data, then the attacker could read the channel by sniffing, instead of going through extra effort of trying to decrypt the data using brute force techniques.

- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.




## CWE-291: Reliance on IP Address for Authentication
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an IP address for authentication.

### Extended Description
IP addresses can be easily spoofed. Attackers can forge the source IP address of the packets they send, but response packets will return to the forged IP address. To see the response packets, the attacker has to sniff the traffic between the victim machine and the forged IP address. In order to accomplish the required sniffing, attackers typically attempt to locate themselves on the same subnet as the victim machine. Attackers may be able to circumvent this requirement by using source routing, but source routing is disabled across much of the Internet today. In summary, IP address verification can be a useful part of an authentication scheme, but it should not be the single factor required for authentication.

### Alternative Terms

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

### Extended Description


If a web product does not properly protect assumed-immutable values from modification in hidden form fields, parameters, cookies, or URLs, this can lead to modification of critical data. Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.


For example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.
