The vulnerability description clearly states that the system **does not check if the authentication method specified in a connection request is allowed**, leading to a bypass by using a **downgraded no authentication method**. This aligns with CWE-757's description of supporting interaction between actors and allowing negotiation of which algorithm should be used, but **not selecting the strongest algorithm that is available to both parties.** CWE-288 was considered as a secondary option because the attacker leverages an alternate path (no authentication) to bypass the intended authentication mechanism.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe757[\"CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n\n    cwe757 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe757 primary\n    class cwe288 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing check** on the authentication method. This leads to the **downgrade** to no authentication, which allows the attacker to **bypass** the captive portal authentication, resulting in **unauthorized network access**.\n- **Root Cause:** **Missing check** for allowed authentication method (partially captured by CWE-757, more directly described by CWE-288, but less specific).\n- **Weakness:** **Downgrade** to no authentication (CWE-757).\n- **Impact:** **Bypass** of authentication, leading to unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-757 because the root cause involves the selection of a less secure \"no authentication\" method during the authentication process. The evidence for this is highlighted in the vulnerability description, which states that the software **does not check if the authentication method specified in a connection request is allowed**. Further supporting evidence comes from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which details how the API accepts the \"no-authentication\" method (authType=0), even when not configured.\n\nCWE-288 was considered as a secondary factor, as the attacker essentially utilizes an alternate \"no authentication\" path to bypass the expected authentication process. However, CWE-757 is more specific to the algorithm downgrade aspect of the vulnerability.\n\nThe CWEs are selected at the base level of abstraction for accuracy.\n\nThe final decision is based on the explicit evidence that the system allows a **downgraded authentication method**, making CWE-757 the most appropriate primary classification.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25

attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or

have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**:

Primary Weakness\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed

changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
