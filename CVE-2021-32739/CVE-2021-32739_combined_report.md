## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information] because the vulnerability allows a read-only user to view the `ticket_salt` of the `ApiListener` object, which is sensitive information. CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, and while there are more specific child CWEs, none of them fit the specific vulnerability as well as CWE-200. CWE-267 [Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions] is included because the read-only privilege allows access to the sensitive `ticket_salt`, which leads to privilege escalation. CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization] is included because the system **incorrectly authorizes** read-only users to view sensitive configuration data.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863) of read-only users, which leads to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200) like the `ticket_salt`. This then allows an attacker to compute tickets and request certificates, ultimately leading to privilege escalation and identity theft. The **privilege defined with unsafe actions** (CWE-267) also contributes since the read-only privilege grants access to sensitive information which can then be used for malicious purposes.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information] as the primary weakness, due to the direct **impact** of the vulnerability: the ability for read-only users to view sensitive configuration data. The retriever results also highlight CWE-267 [Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions] and CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization] as potentially relevant. The final decision includes all three CWEs to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability. CWE-200 captures the immediate **impact** of information disclosure, while CWE-267 and CWE-863 capture the underlying **root causes** of the vulnerability.

The selection of CWEs is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and CVE reference links. Specifically, the vulnerability description states that "With a read-ony users credentials, an attacker can view most attributes of all config objects including `ticket_salt` of `ApiListener`." This directly supports the selection of CWE-200, as it describes the exposure of sensitive information. The CVE reference links content summary further supports this by stating that "The API exposes the `ticket_salt` which is meant to be a secret, to unauthorized (read-only) users."

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the weaknesses described in the vulnerability description and CVE reference links. While more specific child CWEs may exist for each of these CWEs, they do not provide a better fit for the specific details of this vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-32739

## Vulnerability Description
Icinga is a monitoring system which checks the availability of network resources, notifies users of outages, and generates performance data for reporting. From version 2.4.0 through version 2.12.4, a vulnerability exists that may allow privilege escalation for authenticated API users. With a read-ony users credentials, an attacker can view most attributes of all config objects including `ticket_salt` of `ApiListener`. This salt is enough to compute a ticket for every possible common name (CN). A ticket, the master nodes certificate, and a self-signed certificate are enough to successfully request the desired certificate from Icinga. That certificate may in turn be used to steal an endpoint or API users identity. Versions 2.12.5 and 2.11.10 both contain a fix the vulnerability. As a workaround, one may either specify queryable types explicitly or filter out ApiListener objects.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** view most attributes of all config objects including `ticket_salt` of `ApiListener`
- **attacker:** authenticated API users
- **product:** Icinga
- **version:** 2.4.0 through 2.12.4

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32739:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `ticket_salt` attribute of the `ApiListener` object in Icinga 2 is accessible via the web API to authenticated users with read-only permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The API exposes the `ticket_salt` which is meant to be a secret, to unauthorized (read-only) users.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  The exposed `ticket_salt` allows an attacker to compute a ticket, which can be used in combination with the master node's certificate and a self-signed certificate to request a new certificate, potentially impersonating other users or endpoints.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Identity Theft/Impersonation:** An attacker can use the generated certificate to steal the identity of an endpoint or API user. This includes highly privileged API users authenticated by certificates, potentially resulting in full control over the Icinga instance and its connected systems.
- **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the Icinga 2 system using stolen identities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web API:** The vulnerability is exploited by querying the Icinga 2 web API using read-only API user credentials to retrieve the `ticket_salt` value.
- **Certificate Request Manipulation:**  The attacker crafts a certificate request with a generated ticket and the master node's certificate to obtain a valid certificate from Icinga.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated API User:**  The attacker needs valid credentials for a read-only API user.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Icinga 2 API endpoint.
- **Knowledge of Icinga's PKI:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of how Icinga handles certificates and tickets.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes detailed steps on how to exploit the vulnerability.
- The advisory provides workarounds and highlights the importance of upgrading to patched versions.
- The vulnerability allows to escalate privileges from a read-only user to an administrator, if an administrator is configured to use certificate authentication.

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.
- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.




## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

### Extended Description


When resources are released, they can be made available for reuse. For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.


Even when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.


This weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-459
ChildOf -> CWE-212
CanPrecede -> CWE-201

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).

**[Maintenance]** This entry needs modification to clarify the differences with CWE-212. The description also combines two problems that are distinct from the CWE research perspective: the inadvertent transfer of information to another sphere, and improper initialization/shutdown. Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.

**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release
- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.
- **CVE-2003-0291:** router does not clear information from DHCP packets that have been previously used




## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

### Extended Description


Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.


For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.


One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.


### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-36539:** An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.




## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.
