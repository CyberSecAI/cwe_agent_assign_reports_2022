The vulnerability involves injecting malicious code into Groovy scripts, which aligns with the description of CWE-917 as improper neutralization in an expression language statement. CWE-94 was considered because the injected script results in code execution, but CWE-917 more precisely describes the injection vector. Both CWE-917 and CWE-94 are related to CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')), which is a more general class.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe917[\"CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command\"]\n    \n    cwe917 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe917 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe917 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n    class cwe74,cwe77 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  A user with the ability to create Policy Sets injects malicious Groovy scripts into the conditions of a policy (**CWE-917**).\n2.  The injected script **escapes the configured Groovy sandbox**, leading to arbitrary code execution (**CWE-94**).\n3.  The impact is post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description clearly states that the vulnerability lies in the ability to **escape the configured Groovy sandbox** by sending malicious Groovy scripts. This aligns with CWE-917, which describes the improper neutralization of special elements used in an expression language statement.\n\nThe evidence for this mapping comes from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which state \"**rootcause:** **escape the configured Groovy sandbox**\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states \"**Arbitrary Groovy Script Evaluation:** Policy conditions are parsed as Groovy scripts, enabling injection of malicious code.\" This confirms that the vulnerability is due to the ability to inject and execute arbitrary code within the Groovy environment.\n\nCWE-94 was considered as a secondary CWE since the injection leads to code execution. However, CWE-917 more accurately describes the initial **weakness** which allows for this code execution.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-917 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred for root cause analysis. It accurately captures the **improper neutralization** aspect of the vulnerability. CWE-94, also a Base level CWE, is added as a secondary weakness to emphasize the impact of code execution.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
