It has several child CWEs that represent more specific resource consumption issues. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-400 is a general case of resource exhaustion, while CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is a more specific case. CWE-799 is also a Class-level CWE and focuses on the frequency of interactions.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe799[\"CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\"]\n    cwe406[\"CWE-406: Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume (Network Amplification)\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe406 -->|CHILDOF| cwe405\n    cwe405 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe799,cwe406 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **lack of proper control over resource allocation**, which then leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption** by a malicious actor, eventually causing a **Denial of Service (DoS)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was identified as the primary weakness due to the vulnerability description explicitly stating that a malicious actor can perform a Deny of Service (DoS) attack on the affected switch. This aligns with the description of CWE-400, which states that the product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, leading to exhaustion of available resources.\n\nHowever, CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE and the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWE entries are applicable. Therefore, other child CWEs of CWE-400 were considered, such as CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) and CWE-799 (Improper Control of Interaction Frequency).\n\nWhile CWE-770 is a good candidate, the vulnerability description does not provide enough detail to confirm whether the resource allocation itself is unlimited. The description only indicates that the **DoS attack** is possible, implying that a malicious actor can influence the amount of resources consumed. Therefore, CWE-799 (Improper Control of Interaction Frequency) is added as a secondary CWE, because the **malicious actor** is able to perform a **Denial of Service (DoS) attack** because there isn't sufficient interaction frequency control.\n\nThe final decision is to keep CWE-400 as the primary CWE due to its direct relevance to the **impact** of the vulnerability (**DoS attack**). Although it is a Class-level CWE, the lack of specific details in the vulnerability description prevents a more precise mapping to a Base- or Variant-level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n#
