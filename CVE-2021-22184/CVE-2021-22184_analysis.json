CWE-532 is a more specific case of information exposure where the sensitive data ends up in a log file.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe538\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper redaction of sensitive information** and leads to the **insertion of sensitive information into log files**, which ultimately results in **information disclosure**.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper Redaction of Sensitive Information**\n  - **Weakness:** CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\n  - **Impact:** Information Disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-532 as the primary candidate, and this was supported by the retriever results and the vulnerability description which explicitly mentions \"server logs\" and \"sensitive information\". The description indicates that the **sensitive information** was not properly redacted before being written to the logs, thus exposing it to users with access to those logs. This aligns perfectly with CWE-532's description: \"The product writes sensitive information to a log file.\"\n\nCWE-201 was considered because the description states the user was able to \"see sensitive information,\" which could imply the data was \"sent\" in some form. However, the context of the vulnerability makes it clear that the information was exposed via log files, making CWE-532 a better fit.\n\nThe evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description\" supports the selection of CWE-532: \"An information disclosure issue in GitLab starting from version 12.8 allowed a user with access to the server logs to see **sensitive information** that wasnt properly redacted.\"\n\nCWE-532 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level for vulnerability mapping according to MITRE's guidance. It accurately captures the specific weakness, making it the optimal choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
