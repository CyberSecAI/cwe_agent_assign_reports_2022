# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-31802

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-122, a variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The root cause involves CWE-1284, because the application **does not validate the user-provided length** allowing the **heap-based buffer overflow**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper validation of the user-provided length** (CWE-1284), which leads to a **heap-based buffer overflow** (CWE-122), ultimately enabling remote code execution as root.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the detailed vulnerability description and the provided CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The description explicitly states a **heap-based buffer overflow** is present. The root cause is the **trusted user-provided length value** during file upload.

The vulnerability description states: "NETGEAR R7000 1.0.11.116 devices have a **heap-based Buffer Overflow** that is exploitable from the local network without authentication...The problem is that a **user-provided length value is trusted** during a backup.cgi file upload."

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further explains: "The vulnerability is a heap overflow in the `httpd` program of NETGEAR R7000 routers...It stems from improper handling of HTTP requests, specifically the **lack of validation of user-supplied data** when uploading files via `/backup.cgi` and `/genierestore.cgi`...The program allocates a buffer based on the `Content-Length` value and copies the file content into it based on the actual file content length, allowing an attacker to control the size of the allocated buffer and overwrite memory...**Lack of Input Validation**: The program does not properly validate the provided lengths, allowing for discrepancies that lead to the overflow."

The relationship graph shows how CWE-1284 can precede CWE-122, aligning with the vulnerability's root cause.

CWE-122 is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability is explicitly described as a **heap-based buffer overflow**. CWE-1284 is a secondary CWE, representing the **improper validation of the user-supplied length**, which is the root cause that allows for the heap overflow. Both CWEs are at appropriate levels of specificity (Variant and Base, respectively).

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was considered because it's similar to CWE-1284. It was not selected, because it refers to handling inconsistency, while CWE-1284 refers to not validating the length at all.*

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was considered because the vulnerability leads to a buffer overflow. It was not selected because the root cause is not related to an incorrect calculation.*

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was considered, but does not accurately describe the vulnerability.*

## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.

*This CWE was not selected, because it is too general.*

## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE was not selected, because it is too general.*

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected, because it does not accurately describe the vulnerability.*

## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE was not selected, because it is too general.*

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

*This CWE was not selected, because it does not accurately describe the vulnerability.*

## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at
