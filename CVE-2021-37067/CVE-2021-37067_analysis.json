While typically discouraged, the provided description does not offer enough detail to pinpoint a more specific Base or Variant CWE. CWE-200's children, such as CWE-213 [Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies] and CWE-497 [Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere], were considered as potential secondary mappings to provide additional context.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe213[\"CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe213 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe213,cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple in this case. The initial weakness is the exposure of sensitive information, leading directly to the impact of confidentiality being compromised.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the provided description: \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability\". The description key phrases highlight the impact as \"Exposure of Sensitive Information\" and the actor as \"Unauthorized Actor.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] as the primary CWE is based on the direct match with the vulnerability description. However, CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and is generally discouraged. The limited information available prevents a more precise mapping to a Base or Variant CWE.\n\nCWE-213 [Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies] and CWE-497 [Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere] were considered as secondary CWEs to add context. CWE-213 applies if the exposure is due to conflicting policies between the developer and other stakeholders. CWE-497 is relevant if the exposed information is system-level data accessible to unauthorized actors.\n\nThe final selection prioritizes accuracy based on the available evidence, even if it means using a higher-level CWE. The confidence level is moderate due to the lack of specific details about the underlying cause of the information exposure.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-704: Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly convert an object, resource, or structure from one type to a different type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
