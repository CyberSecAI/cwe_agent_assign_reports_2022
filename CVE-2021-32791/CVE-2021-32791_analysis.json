CWE-1204 (Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)) is a base-level CWE, which is preferred. The relationship between CWE-1204 and its parent, CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values), was considered, but CWE-1204 was more specific and therefore more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1204[\"CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)\"]\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    \n    cwe1204 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1204 primary\n    class cwe330,cwe327 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a static IV and AAD** in AES GCM encryption (CWE-1204), leading to a static nonce. Because aes-gcm is a stream cipher, this can lead to known cryptographic issues, since the same key is being reused.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **use of a static IV and AAD** in the AES GCM encryption. The evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links consistently points to this **root cause**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1204 is strongly supported by the evidence:\n- Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**rootcause:** **static IV and AAD**\"\n- CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"root_cause: hardcoded static IV and AAD with a reused key in AES GCM encryption\", \"weaknesses: Use of static initialization vector (IV) and Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) in AES GCM encryption\"\n\nThe Retriever Results also ranked CWE-1204 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) was considered because the **static IV and AAD** weaken the cryptographic algorithm. However, CWE-1204 is more specific to the actual weakness, making it the primary CWE.\n\nThe final decision is based on the direct evidence of the **root cause** and the specificity of CWE-1204 in addressing that cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization\n\t\t\tVector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are\n\t\t\tsufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected\n\t\t\tcryptographic requirements for that primitive.\n\t\t\t\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
