The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a \"Stack-based Buffer Overflow,\" making CWE-121 the most specific and appropriate choice. CWE-119 is too general, while CWE-787 captures the \"out-of-bounds write\" aspect, reinforcing the overflow condition.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper use of a source to destination copy write operation**, leading to a **stack-based buffer overflow**. This overflow allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to crash the routing protocol daemon (RPD), resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases,\" which explicitly mention \"**improper use of a source to destination copy write operation**\" and a \"**stack-based buffer overflow**.\" The description clearly states the impact as a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-121 is the most specific variant for the described **stack-based buffer overflow**. While CWE-119 is a broader category, the explicit mention of \"stack-based\" and \"buffer overflow\" justifies the selection of CWE-121.\n\nThe selection of CWE-121 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the technical details provided in the vulnerability description. The other candidate CWEs, such as CWE-119, are too generic.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its
