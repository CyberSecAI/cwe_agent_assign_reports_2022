There are a number of child CWEs for CWE-20 that could be considered, but without additional information, it's difficult to make a more specific determination. The graph shows that CWE-20 can precede CWE-22, CWE-41, and CWE-74 in potential vulnerability chains.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe41[\"CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n\n    cwe20 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe22\n    cwe20 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe41\n    cwe20 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe22,cwe41,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **poor input validation** (CWE-20). The specific consequences of this **poor input validation** are not detailed, so it is difficult to provide a more complete chain.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**poor input validation**\" in the `checkFlow` function of `StaticFlowEntryPusherResource.java` in Floodlight. This aligns directly with CWE-20, \"Improper Input Validation\".\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-20, further supporting this classification. While CWE-20 is a Class-level CWE and is generally discouraged, the provided information does not give enough detail to select a more specific Base-level CWE.\n\nCWE-1284 \"Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\" was considered because specified quantities were being validated. However, that CWE was deemed to be too specific given the lack of evidence. CWE-1288 \"Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\" was another good candidate, however, that CWE was also deemed too specific given the lack of evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
