CWE-916 is a child of both CWE-328 and CWE-327, making it more specific. CWE-759 (Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt) is a child of CWE-916, making it even more specific, but the evidence does not explicitly state that salting is the only problem. Therefore, CWE-916 is the best fit. The abstraction levels of these CWEs also influenced the selection, with the Base level being preferred over the Class level when a good fit is found.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe759[\"CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt\"]\n    \n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe328\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe759 -->|CHILDOF| cwe916\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe916 primary\n    class cwe328,cwe327,cwe759 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weak hash** used for password storage. This leads to the storage of the password hash in the cookie, making it possible for an attacker who obtains the cookie to **bruteforce** the password offline, ultimately resulting in unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\" The key phrases highlight the **weak hash** as the core issue, and the CVE summary elaborates on how the SHA256 hash of the username and bcrypt-hashed password stored in the cookie enables offline **bruteforce** attacks.\n\nThe graph relationships helped determine the most specific CWE. While CWE-759 is more specific than CWE-916, the description only mentions the **weak hash** and not the absence of a salt. Thus, CWE-916 is the most appropriate.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-916 being a Base level CWE that accurately describes the **weakness** in password hashing.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a one-way cryptographic hash against an input that should not be reversible, such as a password, but the product does not also use a salt as part of the input.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users.
