## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The session identifier is being **unsafely present** in the HTML output. |
| CWE-540 | Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE: The **session identifier** is leaked because it's included **unsafely present** in the HTML output. |
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE:  The description mentions that this vulnerability requires chaining with another attack, like XSS, to exploit. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-201, as it directly relates to the **insertion of sensitive information** (session identifier) into the HTML output. CWE-540 is a supporting CWE, emphasizing that the sensitive information is included in the source code (HTML output). CWE-79 is considered due to the mention of XSS as a potential attack vector, indicating a possible chain of exploitation.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **unsafely present session identifier** in the HTML output. This leads to **sensitive information disclosure**. The vulnerability is then potentially chained with an XSS attack to exploit the exposed session identifier, leading to unauthorized access or impersonation.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified the core issue as the inclusion of sensitive information (session identifier) in the HTML output. The retriever results and graph relationships helped refine the selection of CWEs.

CWE-201 is the most accurate representation of the root cause, as it directly addresses the **insertion of sensitive information** into sent data. The evidence clearly states that a **session identifier** is **unsafely present** in the HTML output, which aligns perfectly with CWE-201's description: "The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor."

CWE-540 is included as a secondary CWE, as it highlights the inclusion of sensitive information in the source code (HTML output). While CWE-540 is related to source code, the primary concern here is the transmission of sensitive information, making CWE-201 the more fitting primary CWE.

CWE-79 is included as the attack requires another attack, so is not the primary weakness.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately capture the root cause and potential exploitation vectors.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of
