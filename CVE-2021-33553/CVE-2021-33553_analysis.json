CWE-78 is a more specific case of CWE-77, focusing on OS commands. Since the vulnerability specifically involves **command injection** that leads to remote code execution, and the provided content indicates the **root cause** is improper neutralization of special elements used in a command, the more specific CWE-78 is chosen as the primary mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: OS Command Injection\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Command Injection\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe77 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is as follows:\n1.  Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command (CWE-78/CWE-77) - **ROOT CAUSE**: The application fails to properly sanitize input, allowing special elements to be interpreted as commands.\n2.  Remote Code Execution - **IMPACT**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the potential for both CWE-77 and CWE-78. However, after considering the CWE relationships and the specific context of the vulnerability, CWE-78 was chosen as the primary CWE due to its greater specificity in describing OS Command Injection.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"Multiple camera devices by UDP Technology, Geutebruck and other vendors are vulnerable to **command injection**, which may allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating, \"The root cause is improper neutralization of special elements used in a command, leading to command injection\" and \"Command Injection (CWE-77): The affected product is vulnerable to command injection\". While CWE-77 is mentioned in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, the evidence also specifies that the impact is remote code execution, which aligns more closely with the typical consequences of OS command injection (CWE-78).\n\nThe decision to use CWE-78 is based on the principle of selecting the most specific CWE that accurately represents the vulnerability. CWE-78 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction, and it directly addresses the scenario of injecting OS commands. The retriever results also list CWE-78 as a relevant candidate. While CWE-77 is a parent of CWE-78, it is more general and less precise.\n\nThe retriever results and graph relationships support the selection of CWE-78 as the primary CWE, as it is a more specific case of command injection than CWE-77, which is a class-level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
