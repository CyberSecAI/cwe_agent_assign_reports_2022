CWE-89 is a specific type of injection that targets SQL databases, making it a more precise classification when the vulnerability involves SQL queries.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Lack of proper validation** of a user-supplied string before constructing SQL queries.\n2.  **Weakness:** SQL Injection (**Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command**).\n3.  **Impact:** Privilege escalation to resources normally protected from the user.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states: \"The vulnerability is due to the **lack of proper validation** of a user-supplied string before using it to construct SQL queries within the maintenanceWindow endpoint,\" and that the **weakness** is \"SQL Injection.\"\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that SQL Injection (CWE-89) is a specific type of injection.\n\nCWE-89 is selected because it directly addresses the **root cause** described in the summary: **improper neutralization** within SQL queries. This is more specific than generic code injection (CWE-94) or other input validation issues. The selection of CWE-89 is also supported by the \"weakness\" of \"SQL Injection\" in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\n\nBased on the provided information, SQL Injection (CWE-89) is the most appropriate and specific classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131:
