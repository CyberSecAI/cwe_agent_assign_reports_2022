While it aligns with the description of **improper access control**, the guidance suggests using more specific descendants. CWE-639, a child of CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-284, represents a more specific scenario where authorization bypass occurs through user-controlled keys. The vulnerability involves an attacker with a restricted profile gaining unauthorized access, suggesting a potential for CWE-639 to apply. CWE-200 is a child of CWE-668 and represents the impact of the improper access control leading to sensitive information exposure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe639,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control** [CWE-284]. The attacker leverages specific CLI commands to bypass the intended access restrictions, leading to the ability to gather sensitive information and modify SSL-VPN tunnel status. This results in information exposure [CWE-200] and potential tampering with the VPN configuration. A possible additional link is the Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key [CWE-639] where the CLI command acts as the user-controlled key, but that's a very weak link in this case.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability was clearly described as **improper access control** [CWE-284]. However, CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, and the mapping guidance discourages its use. Considering the vulnerability's details, the attacker uses CLI commands to bypass access controls and modify other VDOM's SSL-VPN tunnel status and gather sensitive information.\n\nThe description states: \"An **improper access control** vulnerability [CWE-284] in FortiOS versions 6.4.8 and prior and 7.0.3 and prior may allow an authenticated attacker with a restricted user profile to gather sensitive information and modify the SSL-VPN tunnel status of other VDOMs using specific CLI commands.\"\n\nCWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) was considered because the attacker uses specific CLI commands, which could be interpreted as a user-controlled key. However, the evidence is not strong enough to confidently assert that this is the primary weakness, so it is included as a secondary candidate.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) represents the impact of the **improper access control**, as the attacker is able to gather sensitive information. This is a common result of access control issues and is included as a secondary candidate.\n\nThe decision to keep CWE-284 as the primary is based on the clear statement of **improper access control** in the vulnerability description, though its discouraged usage indicates a lower confidence. The other CWEs represent potential mechanisms or impacts.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
