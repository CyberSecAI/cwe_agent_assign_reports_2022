It's a child of CWE-287 Improper Authentication and CWE-1390 Weak Authentication, both **Class** level CWEs. This hierarchy suggests that the authentication bypass is a more specific type of improper or weak authentication. CWE-305 Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness is also considered, and it is at the **Base** level. CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials is also at the **Base** level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe290[\"CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe305[\"CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe290 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe290 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe290 primary\n    class cwe287,cwe1390,cwe305,cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of root cause and weaknesses followed for the Vulnerability Description.\n  - **Root Cause:** Allowing re-use of TOTP codes.\n  - **Weakness:** Authentication Bypass\n  - **Impact:** Gain privileges\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **Authentication Bypass** as the core issue, where the TOTP code for 2FA can be submitted correctly more than once. The evidence supports this, as the vulnerability lies in the lack of validation to prevent the reuse of TOTP passcodes during authentication.\nThe final decision is based on the provided evidence and the relationships between CWEs. CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing is selected because it specifically addresses incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks, aligning with the re-use of TOTP codes. This is the most specific **Base** CWE that fits the vulnerability.\nCWE-287 Improper Authentication and CWE-1390 Weak Authentication are considered as broader **Class** level CWEs, but CWE-290 provides a more precise classification. CWE-305 Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness is considered but the weakness is in the TOTP implementation itself. CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials, while possible, is not the primary issue. The application allows re-use of a TOTP passcode, indicating a flaw in the authentication logic rather than use of a hardcoded value.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed as the result of a separate weakness that is primary to the authentication error.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
