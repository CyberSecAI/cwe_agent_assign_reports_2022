While CWE-200 is discouraged due to being high-level, it accurately captures the exposure of sensitive information. CWE-863 was considered due to the possibility of an authorization issue leading to the information exposure, but evidence for this is weak.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe651[\"CWE-651: Exposure of WSDL File Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe651 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe651,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the implementation of web services using SOAP, followed by an **impact:** where an authenticated user is able to list all databases connection details and credentials. This leads to the **exposure of sensitive information**. The weakness appears to be a **missing or incorrect authorization** check that would prevent authenticated users from accessing sensitive database connection details.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **impact:** as the exposure of sensitive information, which strongly suggests CWE-200. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-200, CWE-651 and CWE-863 as potential candidates. The final selection prioritizes CWE-200 due to its direct relevance to the vulnerability description, further refined by CWE-651 due to the vulnerability existing in the WSDL file. While CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is plausible, the provided information does not provide enough evidence to confirm this as a root cause. The assessment heavily relies on the provided vulnerability description, particularly the phrase \"**impact:** list all databases connection details and credentials.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n- This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability stems from the fact that an authenticated user can list the database connection, not from reliance on an untrusted input.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n- This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability does not involve validating input values as resource identifiers. The core problem is **unauthorized access** to information.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n- This CWE is not directly relevant, as the vulnerability does not clearly hinge on a overly permissive input list.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n- This CWE is too general. The more specific CWE-200 is more relevant.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n- This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability doesn't mention anything about the authentication algorithm.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n- The description is a little too vague, doesn't quite fit\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n- This is not relevant as there's no mention of key modification.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n- This is not relevant as there's no injection scenario described.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n- Not relevant as there is no mention of an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n- The problem is not that the authentication is weak, but that authorization is wrong.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 6929.50\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n- This fits the description very well, and it is the Primary CWE.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 6928.89\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n- This may be related, but requires more evidence, which is not available. The vulnerability description only describes the impact, not how the authorization check is incorrect.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6815.21\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n- There's no user-controlled key.\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6796.70\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is",
