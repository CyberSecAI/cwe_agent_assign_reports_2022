## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-770, which falls under CWE-400. CWE-834 is a peer of CWE-770 and also a child of CWE-400, providing context for the iterative nature of the resource consumption. The abstraction levels guided the selection, with a preference for the base-level CWE-770 due to its specific focus on resource allocation without limits. The relationships highlight how a lack of limits on resource allocation (CWE-770) can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400), potentially through excessive iteration (CWE-834).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** handling of a huge section filled with zeros in an ELF64 binary for the MIPS architecture. This leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption**, specifically due to the **allocation of resources without limits or throttling** (CWE-770), which then results in a denial-of-service condition. The excessive consumption may involve **excessive iteration** (CWE-834) while processing the zero-filled section, ultimately leading to **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400) and DoS.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified **uncontrolled resource consumption** as a key weakness. The analysis refined this by pinpointing the **allocation of resources without limits or throttling** (CWE-770) as the root cause. This is supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which mentions that Radare2 attempts to analyze a large region of memory without proper limits.

The relationships between CWEs further clarified the scenario. CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400, indicating that the uncontrolled resource consumption is a direct consequence of the allocation issue. The inclusion of CWE-834 acknowledges the iterative nature of the analysis, which exacerbates the resource consumption.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-770 directly addresses the **lack of limits on resource allocation**, while CWE-400 and CWE-834 describe the resulting behavior.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is "asymmetric."

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* This is a class level and doesn't fit because there are base level CWEs that more directly describe the vulnerability.

## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* While memory allocation is involved, the core issue isn't directly about excessive size values but rather the **lack of limits on the number of resources allocated**, which is more accurately captured by CWE-770.

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* The primary issue isn't about improper shutdown or release but the **lack of initial limits on allocation**.

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This is not relevant because the vulnerability isn't about sensitive information being present in resources before reuse.

## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* Similar to CWE-770, this could be relevant, but CWE-770 is more directly related to the root cause.

## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
An algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* While an inefficient algorithm might contribute, the main issue is **unlimited resource allocation**, not necessarily the algorithm's complexity.

## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.

*Not Selected:* This is a high-level pillar, and more specific CWEs are available.

## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* This is not about limiting interaction frequency but rather about **limiting resource allocation** during analysis.

## CWE-1176: Inefficient CPU Computation
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**:

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-4021

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in Radare2 in versions prior to 5.6.2, 5.6.0, 5.5.4 and 5.5.2. Mapping a huge section filled with zeros of an ELF64 binary for MIPS architecture can lead to **uncontrolled resource consumption** and DoS.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **uncontrolled resource consumption**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **vector:** mapping huge section filled with zeros of ELF64 binary for MIPS architecture
- **product:** Radare2
- **version:** prior to 5.6.2, 5.6.0, 5.5.4 and 5.5.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-4021:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Radare2 handles ELF64 binaries for the MIPS architecture when a large section filled with zeros is present. Mapping this huge section, interpreted as NOPs (no operation instructions), leads to excessive resource consumption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- Uncontrolled resource consumption: Radare2 attempts to analyze a large region of memory filled with NOPs without proper limits.
- Denial of Service (DoS): The extensive analysis of the large NOP section results in a hang or very long processing times, effectively causing a DoS.
- Vulnerability exists in Radare2 versions prior to 5.6.2, 5.6.0, 5.5.4, and 5.5.2.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service condition. Radare2 becomes unresponsive or takes an impractically long time to complete analysis.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Malicious ELF64 binary: An attacker provides a specially crafted ELF64 binary for MIPS architecture that includes a very large section of zeros.
- Network: The CVSS score specifies a network attack vector, suggesting the file can be delivered remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Ability to provide a specially crafted ELF64 binary to the vulnerable version of radare2.
- No specific user interaction or privileges required.

**Additional Details**
- The issue is related to how the tool interprets and maps large sections of memory with no operations (NOPs), leading to extensive and unproductive analysis.
- A fix involves limiting the analysis of NOP sequences or by imposing a limit on basic block sizes during analysis.
- The vulnerability is classified as high severity with a CVSS base score of 7.5.
- The issue is also tracked as GitHub Security Advisory `GHSA-4g55-4fxv-2g82`
- The issue is associated with CWE-400 (Resource Exhaustion) and CWE-834 (Excessive Iteration)

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-834: Excessive Iteration
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an iteration or loop without sufficiently limiting the number of times that the loop is executed.

### Extended Description
If the iteration can be influenced by an attacker, this weakness could allow attackers to consume excessive resources such as CPU or memory. In many cases, a loop does not need to be infinite in order to cause enough resource consumption to adversely affect the product or its host system; it depends on the amount of resources consumed per iteration.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-691

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2011-1027:** Chain: off-by-one error (CWE-193) leads to infinite loop (CWE-835) using invalid hex-encoded characters.
- **CVE-2006-6499:** Chain: web browser crashes due to infinite loop - "bad looping logic [that relies on] floating point math [CWE-1339] to exit the loop [CWE-835]"




## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.

### Extended Description


Limited resources include memory, file system storage, database connection pool entries, and CPU. If an attacker can trigger the allocation of these limited resources, but the number or size of the resources is not controlled, then the attacker could cause a denial of service that consumes all available resources. This would prevent valid users from accessing the product, and it could potentially have an impact on the surrounding environment. For example, a memory exhaustion attack against an application could slow down the application as well as its host operating system.


There are at least three distinct scenarios which can commonly lead to resource exhaustion:


  - Lack of throttling for the number of allocated resources

  - Losing all references to a resource before reaching the shutdown stage

  - Not closing/returning a resource after processing

Resource exhaustion problems are often result due to an incorrect implementation of the following situations:

  - Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.

  - Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.



### Alternative Terms
Resource Exhaustion

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the "technical impact" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is causing resource consumption, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake. Consider children/descendants such as CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling, CWE-771: Missing Reference to Active Allocated Resource, CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool, CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime, CWE-834: Excessive Iteration, CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification), and others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** "Resource consumption" could be interpreted as a consequence instead of an insecure behavior, so this entry is being considered for modification. It appears to be referenced too frequently when more precise mappings are available. Some of its children, such as CWE-771, might be better considered as a chain.

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.

**[Other]** 

Database queries that take a long time to process are good DoS targets. An attacker would have to write a few lines of Perl code to generate enough traffic to exceed the site's ability to keep up. This would effectively prevent authorized users from using the site at all. Resources can be exploited simply by ensuring that the target machine must do much more work and consume more resources in order to service a request than the attacker must do to initiate a request.


A prime example of this can be found in old switches that were vulnerable to "macof" attacks (so named for a tool developed by Dugsong). These attacks flooded a switch with random IP and MAC address combinations, therefore exhausting the switch's cache, which held the information of which port corresponded to which MAC addresses. Once this cache was exhausted, the switch would fail in an insecure way and would begin to act simply as a hub, broadcasting all traffic on all ports and allowing for basic sniffing attacks.


**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2020-7218:** Go-based workload orchestrator does not limit resource usage with unauthenticated connections, allowing a DoS by flooding the service
- **CVE-2020-3566:** Resource exhaustion in distributed OS because of "insufficient" IGMP queue management, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-1176: Inefficient CPU Computation
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs CPU computations using
         algorithms that are not as efficient as they could be for the
         needs of the developer, i.e., the computations can be
         optimized further.

### Extended Description


This issue can make the product perform more slowly, possibly in ways that are noticeable to the users. If an attacker can influence the amount of computation that must be performed, e.g. by triggering worst-case complexity, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-405

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-37734:** Chain: lexer in Java-based GraphQL server does not enforce maximum of tokens early enough (CWE-696), allowing excessive CPU consumption (CWE-1176)




## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

### Extended Description


Code frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-400
ChildOf -> CWE-665
ChildOf -> CWE-400

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..
- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.




## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Exhaustion: When a weakness allocates excessive memory on the stack, it is often described as "stack exhaustion," which is a technical impact of the weakness. This technical impact is often encountered as a consequence of CWE-789 and/or CWE-1325.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-770
CanPrecede -> CWE-476

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness can be closely associated with integer overflows (CWE-190). Integer overflow attacks would concentrate on providing an extremely large number that triggers an overflow that causes less memory to be allocated than expected. By providing a large value that does not trigger an integer overflow, the attacker could still cause excessive amounts of memory to be allocated.

**[Applicable Platform]** 

Uncontrolled memory allocation is possible in many languages, such as dynamic array allocation in perl or initial size parameters in Collections in Java. However, languages like C and C++ where programmers have the power to more directly control memory management will be more susceptible.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2010-3701:** program uses ::alloca() for encoding messages, but large messages trigger segfault
- **CVE-2008-1708:** memory consumption and daemon exit by specifying a large value in a length field




## CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.

### Extended Description
This is often triggered by improper handling of malformed data or unexpectedly interrupted sessions. In some languages, developers are responsible for tracking memory allocation and releasing the memory. If there are no more pointers or references to the memory, then it can no longer be tracked and identified for release.

### Alternative Terms
Memory Leak

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-772
ChildOf -> CWE-404
ChildOf -> CWE-404

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is often a resultant weakness due to improper handling of malformed data or early termination of sessions.

**[Terminology]** "memory leak" has sometimes been used to describe other kinds of issues, e.g. for information leaks in which the contents of memory are inadvertently leaked (CVE-2003-0400 is one such example of this terminology conflict).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-3119:** Memory leak because function does not free() an element of a data structure.
- **CVE-2004-0427:** Memory leak when counter variable is not decremented.
- **CVE-2002-0574:** chain: reference count is not decremented, leading to memory leak in OS by sending ICMP packets.




## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
out-of-bounds array index
index-out-of-range
array index underflow

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1285
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-119
CanPrecede -> CWE-823
CanPrecede -> CWE-789

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness can precede uncontrolled memory allocation (CWE-789) in languages that automatically expand an array when an index is used that is larger than the size of the array, such as JavaScript.

**[Theoretical]** An improperly validated array index might lead directly to the always-incorrect behavior of "access of array using out-of-bounds index."



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-0369:** large ID in packet used as array index
- **CVE-2001-1009:** negative array index as argument to POP LIST command
- **CVE-2003-0721:** Integer signedness error leads to negative array index




## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.

### Extended Description
Some regular expression engines have a feature called "backtracking". If the token cannot match, the engine "backtracks" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.
 Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:


  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.

  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.

  - The input can be long enough.

 Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. 

### Alternative Terms
ReDoS: ReDoS is an abbreviation of "Regular expression Denial of Service".
Regular Expression Denial of Service: While this term is attack-focused, this is commonly used to describe the weakness.
Catastrophic backtracking: This term is used to describe the behavior of the regular expression as a negative technical impact.

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-5243:** server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.
- **CVE-2021-21317:** npm package for user-agent parser prone to ReDoS due to overlapping capture groups
- **CVE-2019-16215:** Markdown parser uses inefficient regex when processing a message, allowing users to cause CPU consumption and delay preventing processing of other messages.




## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.

### Extended Description
Not provided

## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read
