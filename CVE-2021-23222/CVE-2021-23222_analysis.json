CWE-300 is a Class-level CWE that is commonly misused, but relevant because it discusses channels accessible by non-endpoints, which is how the attacker injects the false responses. CWE-295 is related since it involves certificates. However, the vulnerability doesn't stem from a certificate validation issue itself, but rather from the **handling of unencrypted data** *despite* the presence of certificate verification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe300[\"CWE-300: Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint\"]\n    cwe295[\"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\"]\n\n    cwe300 -->|ChildOf| cwe923[\"CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\"]\n    cwe295 -->|PeerOf| cwe322[\"CWE-322: Key Exchange without Entity Authentication\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe300,cwe295 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to properly handle unencrypted data** after the initial SSL/GSSAPI handshake, leading to the **injection of false responses** by a man-in-the-middle attacker.\n\n**Root Cause:** Improper handling of unencrypted data.\n**Weakness:** Cleartext transmission, channel accessible by non-endpoint\n**Impact:** Injection of false responses, potential data exfiltration\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards CWE-319 as the primary weakness due to the **unencrypted data handling**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states, \"The `libpq` library does not properly validate or discard extra data received alongside the server's SSL/GSSAPI handshake confirmation, treating it as decrypted data.\" This is direct evidence of the **cleartext transmission issue**.\n\nCWE-300, \"Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint\" is included as a secondary issue. The vulnerability enables a man-in-the-middle attacker to inject data, which aligns with the description of CWE-300. The \"Vulnerability Description\" states, \"A man-in-the-middle attacker can inject false responses to the clients first few queries, despite the use of SSL certificate verification and encryption.\" However, the mapping guidance for CWE-300 discourages its use for vulnerabilities where the attacker needs to be in a privileged MITM position, so it's a weaker candidate.\n\nCWE-295, \"Improper Certificate Validation\" was considered because the vulnerability description mentions SSL certificate verification. However, the root cause is not a failure to validate the certificate itself, but the **improper handling of data received *after* the certificate is validated**. The fact that SSL certificate verification exists but is bypassed by this vulnerability is what makes this vulnerability significant.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-319 is a Base level CWE that directly addresses the unencrypted data handling. CWE-300 is a Class level CWE, but it is used to show that an attacker is able to inject responses. CWE-295 is a Base level CWE that mentions how the certificate is not correctly validated, which is relevant since a MITM is able to inject data even with the validation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n...\nThis is not the vulnerability since the the algorithm implementation itself is not the risk.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n...\nThis is related to the vulnerability since the product is accepting invalid data.
