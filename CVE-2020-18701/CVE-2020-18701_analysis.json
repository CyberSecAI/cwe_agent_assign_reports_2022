While CWE-287 [Class] is also related to authentication issues, CWE-613 more precisely captures the **rootcause** of the vulnerability, which is the **failure to invalidate session tokens on logout**. This makes CWE-613 a more specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on a Resource\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe613 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe613 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe613 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events for this vulnerability is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** The application **fails to invalidate a user's authentication token upon logout (CWE-613)**.\n2.  An attacker captures a valid authentication token.\n3.  The user logs out.\n4.  The attacker replays the captured token.\n5.  **Impact:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive information or privileges.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-613 as the primary candidate due to its direct relevance to the **rootcause** described in the vulnerability: \"**not invalidating a users authentication token upon logout**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the \"vulnerability stems from the failure to invalidate the authentication token upon user logout,\" strengthening the selection of CWE-613.\n\nWhile CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) was considered, it is a more general class of weakness. The mapping guidance for CWE-287 explicitly discourages its use when lower-level CWE entries are applicable, further justifying the selection of CWE-613.\n\nThe final decision is based on the provided evidence, particularly the **rootcause** described in the vulnerability description and the supporting details in the CVE reference summary. Selecting CWE-613 provides a more precise and actionable classification of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
