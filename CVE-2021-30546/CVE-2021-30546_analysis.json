CWE-416 is a variant of CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference) and CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiration). While other CWEs like CWE-366, CWE-843, and CWE-415 were considered, they did not directly align with the root cause described in the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe825,cwe672 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use after free** (CWE-416), which leads to heap corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence which clearly states a **use after free** condition.\n\n> Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n> - **rootcause:** **use after free**\n\n> CVE Reference Links Content Summary\n> \"The vulnerability is a **use-after-free** error within the Autofill component.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-416 is at the optimal level of specificity because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a \"use after free\" condition.

At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory \"belongs\" to the code that operates on the new pointer.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDangling pointer: a pointer that no longer points to valid memory, often after it has been freed\nUAF: commonly used acronym for Use After Free\nUse-After-Free\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-825\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nCanPrecede -> CWE-120\nCanPrecede -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
