The vulnerability is due to **improper validation of user-supplied input**, which leads to **command injection**. CWE-20 is a Class level CWE that describes **improper input validation**, but it is too general. CWE-78 is a more specific type of **improper input validation** that leads to **OS command injection**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe77 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper validation of user-supplied input** (CWE-20), which leads to **OS command injection** (CWE-78). The final impact is the execution of arbitrary commands with root privileges.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is due to **improper validation of user-supplied input**, which leads to **command injection**. The attacker can send crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the device.\n\nThe **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** includes:\n- **rootcause:** **improper validation of user-supplied input**\n- **weakness:** **command injection**\n\nThe **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** includes:\n    \"root_cause\": \"The vulnerabilities are due to **improper validation of user-supplied input** in the web-based management interface.\",\n    \"weaknesses\": [\n      \"Command Injection (CWE-77)\"\n    ],\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-78, which is a Base level CWE and a child of CWE-77. The vulnerability is due to **improper validation of user-supplied input**, which leads to **command injection**. CWE-20 is a Class level CWE that describes **improper input validation**, but it is too general. CWE-78 is a more specific type of **improper input validation** that leads to **OS command injection**.\n\nThe retriever results listed CWE-77 as the top combined result.\nCWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') is a Class level CWE.\nThe description reads: The product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.\nThe mapping guidance says: CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was intended instead [REF-1287].\n\nCWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') is a Base level CWE.\nThe description reads: The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\nThe mapping guidance says: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nBased on the key phrases, the retriever results, and the CWE descriptions, CWE-78 is the best match for this vulnerability.\n\nCWE-20: Improper Input Validation\nThe description reads: The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.\nThe mapping guidance says: CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287].\nCWE-20 is too general for this vulnerability.\n\nCWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\nThe description reads: CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\nThis CWE is not related to the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\nThe description reads: The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\nThis CWE is not related to the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:",
