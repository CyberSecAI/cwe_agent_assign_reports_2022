The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"catastrophic backtracking in the regular expression engine,\" directly aligning with CWE-1333. The higher-level CWE-407 is considered as a secondary candidate because while relevant, it's less specific than CWE-1333.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **inefficient regular expression complexity** (CWE-1333), which leads to **catastrophic backtracking**, ultimately resulting in a **denial of service**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-1333 as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**weakness: regular expression denial of service**\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates \"**Root cause of vulnerability**: Catastrophic backtracking in the regular expression engine\". This aligns perfectly with CWE-1333's description: \"The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\"\n\nCWE-407, \"Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity,\" is a broader category, and while applicable, CWE-1333 provides a more precise characterization of the vulnerability. The \"Mapping Guidance\" for CWE-1333 states: \"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\" This reinforces the choice of CWE-1333.\n\nOther CWEs like CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) and CWE-617 (Reachable Assertion) were considered but deemed less relevant. While a DoS results, the root cause is specifically the regex inefficiency, not resource allocation or assertion issues.\n\nThe final decision is based on the strong evidence of the root cause being a specifically inefficient regular expression, making CWE-1333 the most appropriate and specific classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1176: Inefficient CPU Computation\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs CPU computations using\n         algorithms that are not as efficient as they could be for the\n         needs of the developer, i.e., the computations can be\n         optimized further.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
