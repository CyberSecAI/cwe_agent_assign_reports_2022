# Analysis for CVE-2021-22390

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.7 | Class | Primary | Discouraged, but chosen due to lack of more specific information. |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Considered, but evidence insufficient for specific write. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered was the child-of relationship between CWE-119, CWE-787 and other more specific buffer operation CWEs. Because the provided information does not specify the exact nature of the improper memory buffer operation, CWE-119 was chosen as the primary, although it is discouraged. CWE-787 was considered as a secondary candidate as a more specific type of memory buffer issue (an out-of-bounds write), but the description does not explicitly state a write operation occurred.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with a **Memory Buffer Improper Operation**, leading to the potential execution of certain codes.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis, based on the provided vulnerability description, indicates a **Memory Buffer Improper Operation** in Huawei Smartphone. The key phrase suggests a problem with how memory buffers are handled. The provided evidence is somewhat limited, but the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section mentions a Use-After-Free (UAF) issue which is a type of memory management problem.

The retriever results suggest several candidate CWEs, including CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size), CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), and CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound).

Given the lack of specifics, the most appropriate CWE is CWE-119, "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer". While CWE-119 is discouraged for being too general, the provided information doesn't allow for a more specific classification.

CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) was considered, however the provided description does not specifically mention a write operation.

The selection of CWE-119 is at the optimal level of specificity given the evidence. While more specific CWEs exist (e.g., CWE-787), there isn't sufficient evidence to justify their use.

The primary supporting evidence is:
*   "**Memory Buffer Improper Operation**" from the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases.
*   The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" referencing a Use-After-Free (UAF) condition.

# Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-606: Unchecked Input for Loop Condition
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.

## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 7667.64
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small
