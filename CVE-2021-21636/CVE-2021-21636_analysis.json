It represents a general lack of authorization checking. While it is a class, the evidence strongly supports the **missing permission check**, making it a reasonable choice.\nCWE-497 **Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere** is a Base-level CWE. It describes the impact of the missing authorization, specifically, that credential IDs are exposed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe862 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe497\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** - The plugin lacks a permission check on an HTTP endpoint.\n2.  **Impact:** CWE-497 **Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere** - Attackers with Overall/Read permissions can enumerate credential IDs.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and supporting CVE details. The key evidence is the \"**missing permission check**\" which directly aligns with CWE-862. The impact of this **missing permission check** is the ability for attackers to enumerate credentials IDs, aligning with CWE-497 **Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere**.\n\nThe relationship graph shows how the **missing authorization** leads to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nCWE-862 is chosen because it directly represents the root cause. While it is a Class-level CWE, the provided information doesn't allow for a more specific Base or Variant CWE to be selected, however the **missing permission check** is highly indicative of this CWE.\n\nCWE-497 is included as a secondary CWE to highlight the impact of the vulnerability - the exposure of sensitive credential IDs.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization**: This was considered, but the description clearly states that the authorization check is *missing*, not incorrect.\n*   CWE-522 **Insufficiently Protected Credentials**: This was considered but it is more related to storage or transmission of credentials, and in this vulnerability the **missing permission check** enables enumeration of the IDs.\n*   CWE-319 **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information**: This CWE relates to transmitting sensitive information in cleartext, which is not the case here. The credentials IDs are being enumerated due to a **missing permission check**.",
