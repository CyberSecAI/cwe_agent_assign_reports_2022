It has child relationships to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). The secondary CWE is CWE-200, which is also a class-level CWE and a child of CWE-668. The choice of CWE-863 is driven by the **attack on access control** root cause, while CWE-200 is the impact of the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **attack on access control** (**ROOT CAUSE**), which leads to incorrect authorization, allowing the attacker to bypass configured access controls. This in turn leads to exposure of values of private fields (**IMPACT**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-863 as the primary weakness, which is consistent with the **attack on access control** root cause. The description explicitly states that the query infrastructure allows bypassing configured access control. The secondary weakness CWE-200 describes the resulting exposure of sensitive information. The evidence for this is the phrase \"expose values of private fields\".\n\nThe final decision is based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary that points to a capability in the query infrastructure to bypass access control. This results in the exposure of private fields.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) directly reflects the **incorrect** authorization mechanism, while CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) captures the impact of this bypass. While more specific CWEs exist under CWE-863, they don't precisely describe the **attack on access control** as a broad **bypass**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
