It's related to CWE-119 (**Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**), as it is a `ChildOf`. It can also `CANFOLLOW` other memory corruption CWEs. CWE-416 (**Use After Free**) and CWE-125 (**Out-of-bounds Read**) are considered as secondary CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe416 -->|PEEROF| cwe787\n    cwe125 -->|PEEROF| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe416,cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an improper CSS transition leading to an **invalid property for a marker**. This results in **memory corruption**, specifically an **out-of-bounds write**, which can then lead to a **potentially exploitable crash**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The description clearly states that applying an **invalid property for a marker** can lead to **memory corruption** and a crash. The CVE reference summary confirms that the root cause is due to the application of invalid properties on a `::marker` pseudo-element, leading to an **out-of-bounds read** when accessing a property set.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**). This is supported by the vulnerability description, which states that **memory corruption** occurred. Also, the CVE summary states that the vulnerability involves applying an invalid property to a marker, potentially triggering an out-of-bounds write. The selection is further supported by the retriever results, which identified CWE-787 as the top candidate with a high score.\n\nCWE-416 (**Use After Free**) was considered because **memory corruption** could lead to a use-after-free scenario. However, the provided evidence doesn't explicitly mention freeing memory. It is included as a possibility but has a lower confidence score of 0.6.\n\nCWE-125 (**Out-of-bounds Read**) was also considered, based on the CVE summary mentioning the application of invalid properties on a `::marker` pseudo-element, leading to an **out-of-bounds read** when accessing a property set. It is included as a possibility but has a lower confidence score of 0.5.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **memory corruption** aspect of the vulnerability. It's a **Base** level CWE, which is preferred according to MITRE mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n\n## CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n\n## CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 7450.06\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 6676.99\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6521.48\n\n## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6336.66\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6306.36\n\n## CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n\n## CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction Level**: variant\n**Similarity Score**: 4.53\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n\n## CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n\n## CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: variant\n**Similarity Score**: 3.75\n\nCWE-362 (**Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')**) was considered due to the potential for race conditions during CSS transitions.
