It is a parent of CWE-113 (HTTP Request/Response Splitting) and a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). CWE-117 is a child of CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) and CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). The vulnerability description is focused on CRLF injection, making CWE-93 the more direct and specific choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe117[\"CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe93 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe117 -->|CHILDOF| cwe116\n    cwe117 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe93 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe117\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe93 primary\n    class cwe117 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of escaping in log statements**, which leads to **CRLF injection**. The injection allows attackers to manipulate logs.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Lack of escaping in log statements**\n  - **Weakness:** **CRLF injection**\n  - **Impact:** Log manipulation, log poisoning.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-93 as the primary candidate due to the explicit mention of \"CRLF injection\" in the vulnerability description. The retriever results also ranked CWE-93 as the top candidate.\nThe evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section supports this, stating that the \"**weakness/vulnerability present**\" is \"**CRLF log injection**\" due to the \"**lack of escaping in log statements**\". This directly aligns with the description of CWE-93, which states: \"The product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element...but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.\"\nCWE-117 was considered as a secondary weakness, because the **CRLF injection** is happening in the logs.\n\nThe selection of CWE-93 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **CRLF injection** issue, which is the core of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
