This leads to a direct request vulnerability, where an attacker can access sensitive information without proper authentication. CWE-614 is related, as the **sensitive cookie** is exposed because of the direct request. It is a variant of CWE-319. CWE-312 is a weaker candidate because the cookie isn't necessarily being stored in cleartext, but is transmitted as such.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n    cwe425 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe614\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe425 primary\n    class cwe614,cwe312 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n1.  **Missing Authentication/Authorization (CWE-425):** The root cause is the **lack of authentication** for the `/session/list/allActiveSession` endpoint, allowing direct access.\n2.  **Information Disclosure (CWE-614):** The direct request leads to the exposure of sensitive cookie information.\n3.  **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker uses the cookie to create an admin user.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The key evidence is the ability to access the `/session/list/allActiveSession` endpoint without authentication, as stated in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\": \"The Netsia SEBA+ application's \"Active Sessions\" section allows HTTP requests without requiring a valid session cookie.\" This aligns directly with CWE-425, which describes a web application that \"does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\"\n\nThe secondary weakness is the exposure of session cookies in cleartext (CWE-614), which is a direct consequence of the **missing authentication**. The attacker can then use these cookies to gain unauthorized access, highlighting the importance of protecting cookies with the \"Secure\" attribute.\n\nThe relationship analysis reinforced the selection of CWE-425 as the primary cause, as it directly leads to the information disclosure. CWE-614 provides a more specific characterization of the data being exposed.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision - While the application relies on session cookies, the primary issue isn't the reliance on untrusted input, but rather the **lack of authentication** to access the session list.\n*   CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information - While related to CWE-614, CWE-614 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability related to the absence of the Secure attribute in HTTPS sessions.\n* CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - Not applicable, the vulnerability is not about tricking a user into making a request.\n* CWE-287: Improper Authentication - Too broad. CWE-425 describes the specific missing authorization.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately capture the root cause (CWE-425) and the immediate consequence (CWE-614) of the vulnerability, based on the provided evidence.",
