CWE-532 is a more specific case of information exposure, focusing on the logging of sensitive data. While other CWEs like CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) were considered, they didn't precisely capture the act of logging the information, which is the core issue. Abstraction levels guided the selection towards the Base level for greater specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe798 -->|RELATED| cwe312\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe312,cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure logging** mechanism that writes sensitive information to the log file. This leads to the **exposure of encrypted usernames and passwords**. The final impact is potential **unauthorized access** to the database and **data breaches**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability and selecting the most appropriate CWE based on the available evidence. The primary CWE, CWE-532, was chosen because it directly addresses the **insertion of sensitive information into the log file**, which is the core issue. The supporting evidence includes the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions that the AMQ Broker discloses JDBC encrypted usernames and passwords in the application logfile.\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically:\n\n*   \"A flaw was found in the AMQ Broker that discloses JDBC encrypted usernames and passwords when provided in the AMQ Broker application logfile when using the jdbc persistence functionality.\"\n*   \"The vulnerability stems from the Red Hat AMQ Broker logging JDBC connection details, specifically the username and password, in the application log file.\"\n*   \"The logging mechanism does not properly sanitize or redact sensitive data before writing it to the log file.\"\n\nThe graph relationships helped to narrow down the selection to CWE-532, as it is a more specific case of CWE-200 (Information Exposure). The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the logging of sensitive information, which is the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
