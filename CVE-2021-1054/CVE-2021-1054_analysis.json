Given that the vulnerability description specifically mentions a **missing** authorization check, CWE-862 is a more precise classification than its parent. There are no discernible chain relationships applicable in this context.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the **lack of authorization** leading directly to a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, both CWE-285 and CWE-862 were considered due to the vulnerability description indicating that the software \"**does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check**\".\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision comes directly from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"**Root cause of vulnerability**: The NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows **does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check** when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\"\n\nHowever, upon closer examination and consideration of CWE relationships, CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) was selected as the primary CWE. This is because the description uses the phrase \"**does not perform**\" which is more accurately described as a missing authorization check.\n\nCWE-285 is retained as a secondary candidate, as the description also notes \"incorrectly performs\", which could fall under improper authorization, however, the primary cause is **missing** the authorization check.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 provides a more specific and accurate classification, aligning with the principle of choosing the most granular CWE when the evidence supports it.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
