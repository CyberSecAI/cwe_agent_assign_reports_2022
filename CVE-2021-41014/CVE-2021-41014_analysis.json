While CWE-770 and CWE-789 are more specific and at a preferred abstraction level (Base/Variant), the description doesn't provide enough detail to confidently select either of them. CWE-400 is a class-level CWE, which makes it less specific but the only CWE with sufficient support in the description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe789 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the following steps:\n1.  An unauthenticated attacker sends huge HTTP packets to the FortiWeb device.\n2.  The FortiWeb's HTTP daemon does not properly handle these large packets, leading to **uncontrolled resource consumption**.\n3.  This excessive resource consumption makes the httpsd daemon unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).\n\nThe root cause is the **uncontrolled resource consumption** due to the improper handling of large HTTP packets, and the impact is the DoS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the \"Retriever Results\" suggested CWE-400, CWE-770, and CWE-789 as potential candidates. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**uncontrolled resource consumption**,\" making CWE-400 the most relevant primary CWE. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" further supports this by stating that the root cause is \"**uncontrolled resource consumption** due to incorrect handling of large HTTP requests.\"\n\nWhile CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) and CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) are more specific, there isn't enough evidence to confirm the exact mechanism of resource consumption. CWE-770 would apply if the system was allocating resources without limits, and CWE-789 would apply if the memory allocation was based on an excessive size value. Since the description only mentions huge HTTP packets leading to **uncontrolled resource consumption**, it's not specific enough to choose either of these over the more general CWE-400.\n\nTherefore, CWE-400 is selected as the primary CWE because it directly aligns with the provided evidence. While it is a Class-level CWE and thus less specific, it is the best fit based on the available information. The MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-400 due to its high-level nature, but also suggests considering its children; however, as explained above, the children are not specific enough.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an iteration or loop without sufficiently limiting the number of times that the loop is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
