# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1333 | Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE.  This CWE accurately captures the root cause of the vulnerability, which involves an inefficient regular expression leading to excessive CPU consumption. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE identified is CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity), which is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity). This parent-child relationship reflects that inefficient regular expressions are a specific type of inefficient algorithm. The analysis focused on the base-level CWE because it directly describes the root cause.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain consists of:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity** (CWE-1333) due to the regex `<!--[\s\S]*?-->`
2.  **Impact:** Denial of Service due to excessive CPU consumption.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, the vulnerability was identified as having **Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity**. The analysis, based on the provided evidence, strongly supports the selection of CWE-1333.

The vulnerability description states: "prism is vulnerable to **Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity**". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating: "The vulnerability lies within the regular expression used to match comments in the PrismJS library's markup language definition" and "The original regex `<!--[\s\S]*?-->` is susceptible to ReDoS." The root cause and weakness are pinpointed in these phrases.

The retriever results also list CWE-1333 as the top combined result. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-1333 is a child of CWE-407, making it a more specific and appropriate choice.

The analysis concludes that CWE-1333 is the optimal choice because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the inefficient regular expression complexity, and it is at the appropriate level of specificity (Base).

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a regular expression that does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1176: Inefficient CPU Computation
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs CPU computations using
         algorithms that are not as efficient as they could be for the
         needs of the developer, i.e., the computations can be
         optimized further.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-637: Unnecessary Complexity in Protection Mechanism (Not Using 'Economy of Mechanism')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a more complex mechanism than necessary, which could lead to resultant weaknesses when the mechanism is not correctly understood, modeled, configured, implemented, or used.

**Mapping Guidance**:
