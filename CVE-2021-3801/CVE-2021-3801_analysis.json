This CWE accurately captures the root cause of the vulnerability, which involves an inefficient regular expression leading to excessive CPU consumption. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE identified is CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity), which is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity). This parent-child relationship reflects that inefficient regular expressions are a specific type of inefficient algorithm. The analysis focused on the base-level CWE because it directly describes the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity** (CWE-1333) due to the regex `<!--[\\s\\S]*?-->`\n2.  **Impact:** Denial of Service due to excessive CPU consumption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability was identified as having **Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity**. The analysis, based on the provided evidence, strongly supports the selection of CWE-1333.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"prism is vulnerable to **Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating: \"The vulnerability lies within the regular expression used to match comments in the PrismJS library's markup language definition\" and \"The original regex `<!--[\\s\\S]*?-->` is susceptible to ReDoS.\" The root cause and weakness are pinpointed in these phrases.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-1333 as the top combined result. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-1333 is a child of CWE-407, making it a more specific and appropriate choice.\n\nThe analysis concludes that CWE-1333 is the optimal choice because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the inefficient regular expression complexity, and it is at the appropriate level of specificity (Base).\n\nRelevant CWE
