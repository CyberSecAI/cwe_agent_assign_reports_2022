## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that impacted my decision was the ChildOf relationship. CWE-319 [CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information] is a base CWE, providing a good level of specificity for the **rootcause** where the application uses cleartext HTTP for updates. The secondary CWE is CWE-494 [CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check], which follows the first CWE as there is no integrity check when downloading an update. Both are base CWEs so they have the best levels of abstraction.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause** of using cleartext HTTP for updates. This leads to the download of code without integrity checks. The end result is a machine-in-the-middle attack to download a malicious binary.

Cleartext Communication (CWE-319) -> No Integrity Check (CWE-494) -> Malicious Binary Download (Impact)

## Summary of Analysis
My analysis is heavily based on the provided evidence, especially the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" and "CVE Reference Links Content Summary." The **rootcause** is explicitly stated as the application using **cleartext HTTP to check and request updates**. This directly aligns with CWE-319 [CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information].

The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" further supports this by highlighting the lack of encryption and integrity checks. This leads to the secondary CWE of CWE-494 [CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check], as the application doesn't verify the authenticity of the downloaded updates.

The hierarchical relationships influenced my decision by ensuring that I selected the most specific and relevant CWEs. Both CWE-319 [CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information] and CWE-494 [CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check] are base-level CWEs, providing the optimal level of specificity.

Other CWEs Considered:

*   CWE-295 [CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation]: While related to certificate issues, the primary problem isn't the validation of certificates but the use of cleartext HTTP.
*   CWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function]: Authentication might be missing, but the more immediate issue is the cleartext transmission.
*   CWE-346 [CWE-346: Origin Validation Error]: This is too broad and doesn't directly address the cleartext communication and lack of integrity check.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause and the immediate consequence of the vulnerability.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-27574

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in Emote Remote Mouse through 4.0.0.0. It uses cleartext HTTP to check, and request, updates. Thus, attackers can machine-in-the-middle a victim to download a malicious binary in place of the real update, with no SSL errors or warnings.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **uses cleartext HTTP to check and request updates**
- **impact:** download a malicious binary
- **vector:** machine-in-the-middle
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** Emote Remote Mouse
- **version:** through 4.0.0.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27574:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Remote Mouse application uses cleartext HTTP to check for and request updates. This lack of encryption allows for a Machine-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack where a malicious actor can intercept the update request and serve a fake, malicious update binary.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Communication:** The application uses insecure HTTP for update checks and downloads instead of HTTPS.
*   **Lack of Integrity Check:** The application doesn't verify the authenticity or integrity of the downloaded updates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):** By serving a malicious executable as an update, an attacker can achieve complete control of the victim's machine. The attacker can execute any code, install malware, or exfiltrate sensitive data.
*   **No SSL Errors or Warnings:** The victim will not receive any warnings or error messages from the application or OS, making the attack very stealthy and harder to detect.
*   **Forced Update:** An attacker can set the update to be mandatory via the XML configuration to force an update to the malicious binary.
*   **UAC Bypass (Indirect):** While not directly related to the CVE, the attacker can pass through User Account Control (UAC) prompts using the applications input methods, or serve a malicious binary through the auto-update functionality that requires UAC.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **MITM Attack:** An attacker positioned between the victim's computer and the update server (e.g., on the same network or by controlling a router) intercepts and modifies the update traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Position:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the victim's machine and the remote server hosting the updates. This can be achieved by:
    *   Being on the same network as the victim.
    *   Compromising a router that handles the victim's traffic.
    *   Using techniques such as ARP poisoning to redirect traffic.
*   **Web server:** The attacker must be able to host a malicious binary and an XML file that simulates the legitimate update.

**Additional Details from the Content (beyond the official CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability is present in Remote Mouse versions up to and including 3.015, and remains unfixed in 4.0.0.0 (latest version at time of writing in the document)
*   The attacker can force an update by setting the `<mandatory>true</mandatory>` tag in the XML manifest file.
*   The attacker can then serve a malicious binary to the user via a MITM attack.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited without the use of any passwords/authentication with a MITM attack.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry has some significant overlap with other CWE entries and may need some clarification. See terminology notes.

**[Terminology]** The "Origin Validation Error" term was originally used in a 1995 thesis [REF-324]. Although not formally defined, an issue is considered to be an origin validation error if either (1) "an object [accepts] input from an unauthorized subject," or (2) "the system [fails] to properly or completely authenticate a subject." A later section says that an origin validation error can occur when the system (1) "does not properly authenticate a user or process" or (2) "does not properly authenticate the shared data or libraries." The only example provided in the thesis (covered by OSVDB:57615) involves a setuid program running command-line arguments without dropping privileges. So, this definition (and its examples in the thesis) effectively cover other weaknesses such as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), and CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges). There appears to be little usage of this term today, except in the SecurityFocus vulnerability database, where the term is used for a variety of issues, including web-browser problems that allow violation of the Same Origin Policy and improper validation of the source of an incoming message.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2000-1218:** DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning
- **CVE-2005-0877:** DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning

## CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product downloads source code or an executable from a remote location and executes the code without sufficiently verifying the origin and integrity of the code.

### Extended Description
An attacker can execute malicious code by compromising the host server, performing DNS spoofing, or modifying the code in transit.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Research Gap]** This is critical for mobile code, but it is likely to become more and more common as developers continue to adopt automated, network-based product distributions and upgrades. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) might introduce additional subtleties. Common exploitation scenarios may include ad server compromises and bad upgrades.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-9534:** Satellite phone does not validate its firmware image.
- **CVE-2021-22909:** Chain: router's firmware update procedure uses curl with "-k" (insecure) option that disables certificate validation (CWE-295), allowing adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) compromise with a malicious firmware image (CWE-494).
- **CVE-2008-3438:** OS does not verify authenticity of its own updates.




## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

### Extended Description
Capture-replay attacks are common and can be difficult to defeat without cryptography. They are a subset of network injection attacks that rely on observing previously-sent valid commands, then changing them slightly if necessary and resending the same commands to the server.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1390

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-3435:** product authentication succeeds if user-provided MD5 hash matches the hash in its database; this can be subjected to replay attacks.
- **CVE-2007-4961:** Chain: cleartext transmission of the MD5 hash of password (CWE-319) enables attacks against a server that is susceptible to replay (CWE-294).




## CWE-322: Key Exchange without Entity Authentication
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product performs a key exchange with an actor without verifying the identity of that actor.

### Extended Description
Performing a key exchange will preserve the integrity of the information sent between two entities, but this will not guarantee that the entities are who they claim they are. This may enable an attacker to impersonate an actor by modifying traffic between the two entities. Typically, this involves a victim client that contacts a malicious server that is impersonating a trusted server. If the client skips authentication or ignores an authentication failure, the malicious server may request authentication information from the user. The malicious server can then use this authentication information to log in to the trusted server using the victim's credentials, sniff traffic between the victim and trusted server, etc.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-306
CanPrecede -> CWE-923
PeerOf -> CWE-295

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use






## CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
A protocol or its implementation supports interaction between multiple actors and allows those actors to negotiate which algorithm should be used as a protection mechanism such as encryption or authentication, but it does not select the strongest algorithm that is available to both parties.

### Extended Description
When a security mechanism can be forced to downgrade to use a less secure algorithm, this can make it easier for attackers to compromise the product by exploiting weaker algorithm. The victim might not be aware that the less secure algorithm is being used. For example, if an attacker can force a communications channel to use cleartext instead of strongly-encrypted data, then the attacker could read the channel by sniffing, instead of going through extra effort of trying to decrypt the data using brute force techniques.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-693

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is related to CWE-300, although not all downgrade attacks necessarily require an entity that redirects or interferes with the network. See examples.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2006-4302:** Attacker can select an older version of the software to exploit its vulnerabilities.
- **CVE-2006-4407:** Improper prioritization of encryption ciphers during negotiation leads to use of a weaker cipher.
- **CVE-2005-2969:** chain: SSL/TLS implementation disables a verification step (CWE-325) that enables a downgrade attack to a weaker protocol.




## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

### Extended Description


Attackers might be able to spoof the intended endpoint from a different system or process, thus gaining the same level of access as the intended endpoint.


While this issue frequently involves authentication between network-based clients and servers, other types of communication channels and endpoints can have this weakness.


### Alternative Terms
