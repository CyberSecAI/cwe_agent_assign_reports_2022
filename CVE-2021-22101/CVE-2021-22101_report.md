# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-22101

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-770, is a child of CWE-400, indicating a more specific type of uncontrolled resource consumption. CWE-20, Improper Input Validation, can precede CWE-770, suggesting that the lack of input validation might contribute to the resource allocation issue. The relationship between these CWEs helped to identify the root cause and the flow of the vulnerability. Choosing CWE-770 provides a more precise classification than its parent, CWE-400, aligning with best practices.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the lack of proper input validation, leading to the allocation of resources without limits or throttling, ultimately resulting in uncontrolled resource consumption and a denial-of-service.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, several CWEs were considered based on the vulnerability description. The vulnerability description key phrases and CVE reference links content summary highlighted the **denial of service** caused by **REST HTTP requests with label_selectors** that generate an **enormous SQL query**. This led to considering CWE-400, CWE-20, and CWE-770.

The final decision to select CWE-770 as the primary CWE is based on the following analysis:

*   The **root cause** is the **allocation of resources without limits or throttling** when processing REST HTTP requests with `label_selectors`, leading to the generation of very large SQL queries. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-770. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states, *"Specifically, the processing of these requests leads to the generation of extremely large SQL queries."* and *"The requests include `label_selectors` parameters which trigger the generation of the problematic SQL queries."*
*   CWE-400, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, is a more general class and less specific than CWE-770. While the vulnerability does result in uncontrolled resource consumption, the more precise weakness is the lack of limits on resource allocation. The Mapping Guidance for CWE-400 advises: *"Closely analyze the specific mistake that is causing resource consumption, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake. Consider children/descendants such as CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling..."*
*   CWE-20, Improper Input Validation, is also relevant because the `label_selectors` are not properly validated, which allows the generation of the enormous SQL query. However, the immediate cause of the denial of service is the unbounded resource allocation. CWE-20 can be considered a contributing factor, as indicated by the CanPrecede relationship with CWE-770. However, the core issue remains with resource management rather than input handling itself.

Therefore, CWE-770 is the most accurate and specific representation of the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The provided evidence supports this conclusion. The selection is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) and aligns with MITRE's mapping guidance.
