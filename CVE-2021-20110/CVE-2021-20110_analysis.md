# Analysis for CVE-2021-20110

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-120 | Buffer Copy without Checking Size ('Classic Buffer Overflow') | 1.0 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 1.0 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-190, **Integer Overflow or Wraparound**, which leads to a **heap overflow**. This can be further described as CWE-787, **Out-of-bounds Write** or CWE-120, **Buffer Copy without Checking Size ('Classic Buffer Overflow')**, as the **integer overflow** results in allocating insufficient memory, and the subsequent write operation overflows the buffer.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with:
1.  **Integer Overflow**: CWE-190, **Integer Overflow or Wraparound**, in the calculation of the buffer size.
2.  **Heap Overflow**: The undersized buffer is then overflowed. This can be represented as:
    *   CWE-787, **Out-of-bounds Write**, due to writing beyond the allocated buffer.
    *   CWE-120, **Buffer Copy without Checking Size ('Classic Buffer Overflow')**, because the data is copied into the buffer without checking the size.
3. **Remote Code Execution**: Due to the ability to write to arbitrary memory locations.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is the **integer overflow** (CWE-190) when calculating the buffer size. This then leads to a **heap overflow** because the allocated buffer is too small. The **heap overflow** can be classified as CWE-787, **Out-of-bounds Write**, because the write operation goes beyond the buffer's boundaries, or CWE-120, **Buffer Copy without Checking Size ('Classic Buffer Overflow')**. Both CWE-787 and CWE-120 are appropriate depending on the specific mechanism. The description indicates a classic buffer overflow scenario where data is copied into the undersized buffer without proper bounds checking.

The vulnerability description states: "The Integer Overflow occurs when receiving POST response from the Manage Engine server, and the agent calling HttpQueryInfoW in order to get the Content-Length size from the incoming POST request. This size is taken, but multiplied to a larger amount. If an attacker specifies a Content-Length size of 1073741823 or larger, this integer arithmetic will wrap the value back around to smaller integer, then calls calloc with this size to allocate memory. The following API InternetReadFile will copy the POST data into this buffer, which will be too small for the contents, and cause **heap overflow**."

Therefore, the primary CWE is CWE-190 because that's the root cause of the vulnerability. The **heap overflow** that results can be described with either CWE-787 or CWE-120. Because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions that `InternetReadFile` copies POST data into the buffer which is too small, CWE-120 is slightly more accurate.

CWE-295, **Improper Certificate Validation**, was considered but not selected as the primary CWE. Although the vulnerability description mentions that the agent doesn't validate HTTPS certificates, this is a separate vulnerability that allows an attacker to send a NEWSCAN request. The **integer overflow** and subsequent **heap overflow** is a different issue.

CWE-789, **Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value** was also considered. However, it is less appropriate because the **integer overflow** results in a smaller than expected buffer being allocated, not an excessively large one.
