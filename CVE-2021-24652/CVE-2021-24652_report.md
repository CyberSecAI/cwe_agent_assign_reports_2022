## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is the parent-child relationship between CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and both CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). While CWE-285 is discouraged, its children are more specific. Since the vulnerability description explicitly states "**incorrect checks**," CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is chosen as the primary CWE. CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is considered a secondary candidate because it's possible the checks were entirely missing, but the description leans towards an error in the checks performed. Both are classes and could have more specific base level CWEs.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect checks** leading to the ability for any logged-in user to modify, delete, or add `ultp_options` values.
- **Root Cause:** **Incorrect Authorization** (CWE-863).
- **Impact:** Ability to modify, delete, or add `ultp_options` values, leading to potential data manipulation or privilege escalation.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on the "**incorrect checks**" phrase in the vulnerability description. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions "**Missing access controls**" and "**incorrect checks**," supporting the selection of CWE-863 and CWE-862.

The relationship graph helped visualize the hierarchy of authorization-related CWEs. The decision to choose CWE-863 as primary and CWE-862 as secondary is based on the description explicitly mentioning **incorrect checks**, suggesting an attempt at authorization that failed, rather than a complete absence of authorization.

The selected CWEs are at the Class level. Further investigation may reveal a more specific Base or Variant CWE. However, based solely on the provided evidence, CWE-863 and CWE-862 are the most appropriate classifications.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

This CWE was considered, but it is not the best fit. While it involves authorization bypass, the root cause isn't directly tied to user-controlled keys but rather to the **incorrect checks** performed during authorization.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

This CWE was also considered. While the attack vector involves AJAX requests, the core issue isn't related to assumed-immutable parameters but to the **incorrect authorization checks**.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

This CWE is not the best fit because the problem is **incorrect checks**, not necessarily the reliance on untrusted inputs.

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

This is not the best fit since the issue occurs post-authentication.

## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

Similar to CWE-1390, this is related to authentication, but the problem is with authorization.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

This is too specific and not the primary cause.

## CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs authentication based on the name of a resource being accessed, or the name of the actor performing the access, but it does not properly check all possible names for that resource or actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

Not the best fit since the problem is **incorrect authorization checks**, not necessarily related to resource naming.

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

The issue is not in the authentication algorithm, but the authorization checks.

## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

This is possible but the provided evidence is not specific enough to confidently assign it.

## CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts within a short time frame.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of
