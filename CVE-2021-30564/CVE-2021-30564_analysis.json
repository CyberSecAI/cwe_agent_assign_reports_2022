This is a heap buffer overflow allowing a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. |\n| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability is specifically a heap-based buffer overflow. |\n| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. Considered because it is a more general case of memory buffer errors. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-787, which is a base level CWE describing an out-of-bounds write. The secondary CWE, CWE-122, is a variant that specifies that the out-of-bounds write occurs on the heap. CWE-119 is a class-level CWE and parent of both CWE-787 and CWE-122, representing a more general case of improper buffer operation restrictions. The relationships that influenced the selection are the parent-child relationships between CWE-119, CWE-787, and CWE-122.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **heap buffer overflow** which is **CWE-787**, and results in the potential to exploit heap corruption, and potential for arbitrary code execution or denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **heap buffer overflow** as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description states \"**Heap buffer overflow** in WebXR in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.164 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.\" The phrase \"**Heap buffer overflow**\" is a key indicator. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this root cause: \"root_cause\": \"Heap buffer overflow in WebXR.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 is based on the vulnerability description and CVE details, indicating a **heap buffer overflow** leading to potential heap corruption. The mapping guidance for CWE-787 allows its usage at the Base level of abstraction. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119, but CWE-787 is more specific to the type of **out-of-bounds write**.\n\nCWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) was considered because the vulnerability is specifically described as a \"heap buffer overflow\". This is a variant of CWE-787.\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) was considered but ultimately classified as secondary because it is a more general class of vulnerability. The mapping guidance for CWE-119 discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available, like CWE-787.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the **heap buffer overflow** condition (CWE-787) and the location of the overflow (heap, CWE-122).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\nNot selected because the root cause is not related to buffer size calculation, but rather an out-of-bounds write.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\nNot selected because the root cause is not related to integer underflow.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\nNot selected because the root cause is not related to an off-by-one error.\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\nNot selected because there's no evidence to support a race condition.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\nNot selected because the root cause is not related to numeric truncation.\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\nNot selected because the vulnerability is an overflow (write past the end), not an underflow (write before the beginning).\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\nNot selected because there's no evidence to support improper locking.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\nNot selected because the description doesn't point to an incorrect length value being used to access the buffer.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\nNot selected because the root cause is not related to resource shutdown or release.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\nNot selected because the root cause is not related to sensitive information reuse.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\nNot selected because the root cause is not related to integer overflow.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\nNot selected because the vulnerability is related to an out-of-bounds write.\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\nNot selected because the root cause is not related to a double free.\n\n## CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\nNot selected because the description doesn't suggest the attacker has control of where they can write in memory.\n\n## CWE-170: Improper Null Termination\nNot selected because the root cause is not related to null termination.\n\n## CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\nNot selected because the root cause is not explicitly related to a buffer copy operation.\n\n## CWE-416: Use After Free\nNot selected because the root cause is not related to use-after-free.\n\n## CWE-195: Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error\nNot selected because the root cause is not related to signed to unsigned conversion.\n\n## CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\nNot selected because the root cause is not related to pointer dereference.\n\n## CWE-1341: Multiple Releases of Same Resource or Handle\nNot selected because the root cause is not related to multiple releases of the same resource.\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\nNot selected because the root cause is not related to improper validation of specified quantity in input.",
