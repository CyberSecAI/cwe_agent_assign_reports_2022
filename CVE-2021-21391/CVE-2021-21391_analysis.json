The selection of the Base level CWE-1333 was preferred over the Class level CWE-407 because of its specificity to the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single point: the use of an inefficient regular expression leading to denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the **rootcause** \"regular expression denial of service\" and the **weakness** \"regular expression complexity\" as per the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\n\nThe choice of CWE-1333 is strongly supported by this evidence:\n> \"Following an internal audit, a **regular expression denial of service** (ReDoS) vulnerability has been discovered in multiple CKEditor 5 packages.
