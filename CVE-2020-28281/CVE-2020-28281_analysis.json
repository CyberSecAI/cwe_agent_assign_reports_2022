This hierarchical relationship indicates that CWE-1321 is a more specific case of the broader weakness described by CWE-915, fitting the vulnerability description more accurately. CWE-1321 can precede CWE-471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1321[\"CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\"]\n    cwe915[\"CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Initialization\"]\n    cwe471[\"CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\"]\n\n    cwe1321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe915\n    cwe1321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe1321 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe471\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1321 primary\n    class cwe915,cwe913,cwe471 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improperly controlled modification of object prototype attributes (CWE-1321)**, leading to potential modification of assumed-immutable data (CWE-471), which can then result in denial of service and remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly supports the selection of CWE-1321 as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**prototype pollution**\", which aligns directly with the name and description of CWE-1321. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause** is the lack of type checking in the `replaceValue()` function, which allows an attacker to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects. This directly corresponds to the weakness described in CWE-1321: \"The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype.\"\n\nCWE-915 is considered as a secondary CWE because it is a broader classification that encompasses the specific issue of prototype pollution. While the vulnerability involves **improperly controlled modification of dynamically-determined object attributes**, the focus is specifically on the object prototype, making CWE-1321 a more precise fit.\n\nThe decision is based on clear evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The hierarchical relationship between CWE-1321 and CWE-915 further supports this decision, as CWE-1321 is a variant of CWE-915 and provides a more specific classification. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-1321 being a Variant and CWE-915 being a Base CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs
