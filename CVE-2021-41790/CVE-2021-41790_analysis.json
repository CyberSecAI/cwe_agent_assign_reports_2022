While code execution is an impact, CWE-94 specifically addresses the **improper generation of code**. CWE-863 is related in that the **lack of proper authorization** allows for the execution of the script action.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n    \n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe74,cwe913,cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect authorization**, leading to the ability to upload scripts outside of the intended Data Dictionary, which then enables the **improper generation of code** during Script Action execution, ultimately resulting in arbitrary code execution within a sandboxed environment.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the script execution and the resulting arbitrary code execution. The core issue, as identified in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", is that the **inadequate validation** in the business logic of the script execution leading to potential privilege escalation which occurs because the application handles script execution within its sandboxed environment **improperly**, and certain edge cases were not properly handled.\n\nThe retriever results suggested CWE-22, CWE-184, CWE-116, CWE-434, and CWE-917. However, based on the provided evidence and the descriptions of these CWEs, they did not accurately reflect the root cause. For example, CWE-22 relates to path traversal, CWE-184 to incomplete lists of disallowed inputs, CWE-116 to improper encoding, CWE-434 to unrestricted file uploads, and CWE-917 to expression language injection.\n\nThe strongest candidate was CWE-94, because the vulnerability involves executing scripts uploaded outside of the Data Dictionary. \"Script Action execution allows executing scripts uploaded outside of the Data Dictionary.\" This indicates that the application is generating code (by executing the script) and that there is **improper control** over what code is being generated. The **lack of authorization** is a contributing factor, as it allows the attacker to upload the malicious scripts in the first place.\n\nCWE-863 captures the authorization aspect since \"This could allow a logged-in attacker to execute arbitrary code inside a sandboxed environment.\". This implies that the attacker, by being logged-in, can bypass some authorization checks to perform actions they should not be able to.\n\nThe decision to classify CWE-94 as the primary CWE is based on the MITRE mapping guidance, which states that it should only be used when the product's functionality intentionally constructs all or part of a code segment. In this case, the \"Script Action execution\" feature explicitly involves the execution of scripts, indicating code generation. The mapping guidance also mentions that CWE-94 is frequently misused for vulnerabilities with a technical impact of \"code execution,\" but in this case, the vulnerability *directly* involves the generation and execution of code.\n\nThe selection of CWE-94 and CWE-863 reflects the two-faceted nature of the vulnerability: the improper generation of code due to the execution of untrusted scripts (CWE-94), and the bypass of authorization checks that allows the initial upload (CWE-863).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
