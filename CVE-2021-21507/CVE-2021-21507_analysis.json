CWE-261 is also related to using weak cryptographic algorithms or inadequate encryption strength, as represented by the relationship to CWE-326 **[CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength]**, though not directly linked in the graph. The choice of CWE-261 is preferred because it more accurately reflects the described **weakness**, which is about the trivial encoding of passwords rather than broader issues like broken algorithms or general credential protection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe261[\"CWE-261: Weak Encoding for Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    \n    cwe261 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe261 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe326 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the **weak password encryption** (**ROOTCAUSE**), leading to the disclosure of user credentials (IMPACT). The attacker then leverages these disclosed credentials to access the vulnerable system with compromised privileges (IMPACT).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the Dell security advisory for CVE-2021-21507. The advisory explicitly states the **root cause** as \"**weak password encryption**\". The advisory also notes that the impact is the disclosure of user credentials, which can then be used to access the system.\n\nThe selection of CWE-261 **[CWE-261: Weak Encoding for Password]** is based on the high retriever score and the alignment of its description with the provided vulnerability details. The advisory uses the term \"**weak password encryption**\", which directly corresponds to the concept of weak encoding.\n\nCWE-326 **[CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength]** and CWE-522 **[CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials]** were considered as potential mappings. However, CWE-261 **[CWE-261: Weak Encoding for Password]** is more specific than CWE-326 **[CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength]**, as the encryption isn't necessarily weak in its algorithmic design, but rather in its application (trivial encoding). Also, CWE-261 **[CWE-261: Weak Encoding for Password]** is more specific than CWE-522 **[CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials]**, because we specifically know it is a **weak encoding** issue.\n```",
