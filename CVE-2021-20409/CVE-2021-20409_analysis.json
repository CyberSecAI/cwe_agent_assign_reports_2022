Although CWE-614 is more specific (\"Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"), the vulnerability description focuses on the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security** in general, which leads to sensitive information being transmitted in cleartext. Therefore, the more general CWE-319 is more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    \n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe614 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**, leading to cleartext transmission of sensitive information, which can be intercepted by a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary factor in the assessment is based on the vulnerability description key phrases, which states the **rootcause** as **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates that the ISIQ server **does not include the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header** in error responses.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information), is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred. The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information because HSTS is not properly enabled, resulting in transmission of data in cleartext. The retriever results also list CWE-319 as the top combined result.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-300: Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not adequately verify the identity of actors at both ends of a communication channel, or does not adequately ensure the integrity of the channel, in a way that allows the channel to be accessed or influenced by an actor that is not an endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-300 is commonly misused for vulnerabilities in which the prerequisites for exploitation require the adversary to be in a privileged \"in-the-middle\" position.\n\n*CWE Considered but not used:*\n\n*   CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint): This was considered but not chosen because the description states that CWE-300 is commonly misused when the attacker needs to be in a privileged \"in-the-middle\" position.

The vulnerability is broader, relating to the general lack of HSTS.",
