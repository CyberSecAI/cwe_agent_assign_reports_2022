CWE-345 is a class level of abstraction and therefore less specific. CWE-1310 is also considered as a secondary candidate because the **insufficient verification** occurs in the boot ROM and there's no patching ability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe1310[\"CWE-1310: Missing Ability to Patch ROM Code\"]\n\n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe345,cwe1310 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Insufficient verification of the integrity of decrypted image** (CWE-347).\n2.  **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution in the PSP.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **insufficient verification of the integrity of the decrypted image** as the primary **weakness**. The vulnerability description and CVE reference links support this.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-347, which directly addresses the **improper verification of a cryptographic signature**. The evidence is strong, as the vulnerability stems from the CPU internal ROM improperly implementing the decryption of signed off-chip firmware, which falls under the scope of CWE-347.\n\nCWE-345 was considered but not chosen as the primary because it's a broader class describing **insufficient verification of data authenticity**, but CWE-347 is more specific to cryptographic signatures. The mapping guidance discourages using class-level CWEs when a more specific base-level CWE is available.\n\nCWE-1310 was considered as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability occurs in the ROM.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-347 being the most direct representation of the vulnerability's root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
