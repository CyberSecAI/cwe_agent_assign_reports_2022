The absence of CSRF tokens leads to **CWE-352** [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)].\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the application is susceptible to both Reflected XSS and CSRF. The CVE reference links content summary confirms that the root cause of the XSS vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in `app/admin/subnets/find_free_section_subnets.php`, and the root cause of the CSRF vulnerability is the absence of CSRF tokens in the form.\n\nThe retriever results also support this classification, with **CWE-79** [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] and **CWE-352** [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] being the top two combined results.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately represent the weaknesses described in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. **CWE-79** [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is a Base level CWE that accurately represents the lack of input sanitization, while **CWE-352** [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] is a Compound level CWE that accurately represents the absence of CSRF tokens.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-80 was considered but not used because **CWE-79** [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is a more general case of XSS.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\nCWE-74 was considered but not used because **CWE-79** [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is a lower-level weakness that is more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-184 was considered but not used because the vulnerability is not specifically related to an incomplete list of disallowed inputs, but rather a general lack of input sanitization.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
