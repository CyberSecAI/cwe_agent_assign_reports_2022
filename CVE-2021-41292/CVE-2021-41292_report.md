## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-288 | Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-288, a base-level CWE. This is preferred because it represents a specific scenario where authentication is bypassed through an alternate path, which aligns with the cookie poisoning attack vector. CWE-288 is a child of CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). The secondary CWE, CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), is a class-level CWE, suggesting that there might be a more specific base or variant available.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** in how the application handles cookies, leading to authentication bypass. An unauthenticated attacker leverages cookie poisoning to circumvent authentication, disclose sensitive information, and manipulate HVAC systems.

Root Cause: Improper cookie handling leading to predictable or manipulable authentication tokens.
Weakness: Authentication Bypass (CWE-288)
Impact: Disclosure of sensitive information, manipulation of HVAC systems.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis indicates that CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) is the most appropriate primary CWE for this vulnerability. The vulnerability description highlights the use of cookie poisoning to bypass authentication, which directly aligns with the description of CWE-288. The retriever results also list CWE-288 as the top candidate.

CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) was considered as a secondary CWE because cookie poisoning often involves the **insufficient protection of credentials**. However, the primary issue is the bypass itself, making CWE-288 more directly relevant. CWE-522 is a Class level and could have a more specific Base level vulnerability.

The evidence from the vulnerability description states: "An unauthenticated attacker through cookie poisoning can remotely **bypass authentication** and disclose sensitive information and circumvent physical access controls in smart homes and buildings and manipulate HVAC."

The graph relationships support the selection of CWE-288 because it is a base-level CWE that directly addresses the authentication bypass achieved through an alternate channel.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-288 accurately captures the mechanism of the attack, while CWE-522 provides additional context regarding the protection of credentials.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-291: Reliance on IP Address for Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an IP address for authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed as the result of a separate weakness that is primary to the authentication error.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs authentication based on the name of a resource being accessed, or the name of the actor performing the access, but it does not properly check all possible names for that resource or actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
This attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-603: Use of Client-Side Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A client/server product performs authentication within client code but not in server code, allowing server-side authentication to be bypassed via a modified client that omits the authentication check.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 4646.11
