It is a child of CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) and CWE-923 (Improper or Incomplete Initialization). Choosing CWE-297 provides a more specific characterization of the vulnerability than its parent CWE-295.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe297[\"CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch\"]\n    cwe295[\"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\"]\n    cwe923[\"CWE-923: Improper or Incomplete Initialization\"]\n    \n    cwe297 -->|CHILDOF| cwe295\n    cwe297 -->|CHILDOF| cwe923\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe297 primary\n    class cwe295,cwe923 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to perform correct host name verification**, leading to a potential Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, and ultimately resulting in the interception of traffic and the ineffectiveness of field-level encryption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment was based on the vulnerability description, which highlighted the **failure to perform correct host name verification**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states that the root cause is the MongoDB Java driver's failure to perform proper hostname verification of the KMS server's certificate.\n\nThe Retriever Results strongly suggested CWE-297 (Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch) as the most relevant CWE, with a high similarity score. The evidence supports this selection, as the vulnerability directly involves the **failure to properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.**\n\nCWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) was also considered, but CWE-297 is a more specific variant that directly addresses the hostname mismatch aspect of the vulnerability. The MITRE mapping guidance recommends using the most specific CWE available, which further supports the selection of CWE-297.\n\nOther CWEs, such as CWE-346 (Origin Validation Error), CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm), and CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information), were considered but deemed less relevant because they do not precisely capture the specific weakness of improper hostname verification. The provided evidence clearly points to a problem with hostname validation within the certificate validation process, making CWE-297 the most accurate and specific classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
