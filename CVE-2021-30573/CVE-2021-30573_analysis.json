It can be preceded by CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size) or CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition). CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a potential secondary CWE, as it is a common consequence of memory corruption issues. However, the description and reference summary explicitly mention **use after free** as the root cause, making CWE-416 the more direct and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe120\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe123\n    cwe787 -->|CHILD_OF| cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe825,cwe672,cwe120,cwe123 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **use after free** (**CWE-416**) in the GPU component of Google Chrome. This **rootcause** allows a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption, which is the impact. The attacker crafts an HTML page to trigger the vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment and conclusion are based on the evidence provided, particularly the vulnerability description key phrases and CVE reference links content summary. The primary **rootcause** is clearly identified as a **use after free** in the GPU component. The reference summary reinforces this by stating \"An **use after free** flaw was found in the GPU component of the Chromium browser\" and listing \"**Use after free**\" as a weakness. Given this strong evidence, CWE-416 is the most appropriate choice.\n\nCWE-787 was considered as a secondary candidate because the impact is heap corruption, which can be a result of out-of-bounds writes. However, since the **rootcause** is a **use after free**, and there's no explicit mention of an out-of-bounds write, CWE-416 is the more accurate primary mapping.\n\nThe selection of CWE-416 is at the optimal level of specificity. It is a Variant, which is a preferred level of abstraction. It directly addresses the **rootcause** of the vulnerability, as supported by the evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
