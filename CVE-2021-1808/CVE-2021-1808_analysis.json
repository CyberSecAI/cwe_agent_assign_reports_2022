Since the description mentions \"read restricted memory\" as an impact, I am considering CWE-125 as well. However, the root cause is **memory corruption**, which is more closely associated with writing than reading. Therefore, CWE-787 is the primary mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **memory corruption** issue, which allows an application to read restricted memory.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **memory corruption** issue, which directly relates to writing to memory. The CVE description states \"An application may be able to read restricted memory,\" indicating an impact that could be related to reading out-of-bounds. The primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions is CWE-787.\n\nBased on the evidence provided:\n- The vulnerability description mentions \"**memory corruption** issue\" as the root cause.\n- The impact is that \"An application may be able to read restricted memory.\"\n- The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section also confirms the root cause as \"A **memory corruption** issue\" and the impact as \"An application may be able to read restricted memory\".\n\nGiven the focus on memory corruption as the root cause, and the potential for reading restricted memory as a consequence, CWE-787 is selected as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-125 is considered a secondary candidate due to the \"read restricted memory\" impact.\n\nCWE-119 is too general.\n\nCWE-843 (Type Confusion), CWE-415 (Double Free), CWE-665 (Improper Initialization), CWE-667 (Improper Locking), CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition), CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), CWE-282 (Improper Ownership Management), and CWE-1263 (Improper Physical Access Control) do not fit the provided vulnerability description as well as CWE-787 and CWE-125.\n\nTherefore, my selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1263: Improper Physical Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is designed with access restricted to certain information, but it does not sufficiently protect against an unauthorized actor with physical access to these areas.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product violates well-established principles for secure design.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
