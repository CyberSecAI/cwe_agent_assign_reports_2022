CWE-352 requires that the application cannot sufficiently verify whether a request was intentionally provided by the user. CWE-862 indicates that the application does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves:\n1.  **Missing Authorization Checks (CWE-862):** The application **fails to properly verify** the user's permissions to perform the requested action.\n2.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CWE-352):** The application **lacks sufficient CSRF protection**, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a victim user.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states the **root cause** as **\"missing authorisation and CSRF checks\"** in the `add_calendar_event` AJAX actions. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating that the plugin **\"lacks proper authorization and CSRF checks.\"**\n\nThe Retriever Results list CWE-352 and CWE-862 as top candidates. CWE-352 is a Compound weakness representing Cross-Site Request Forgery. CWE-862 is a Class-level weakness representing Missing Authorization.\n\nThe evidence strongly supports the selection of both CWE-352 and CWE-862. The application **does not properly verify** the origin of the request (CSRF), and **does not check** if the user has the necessary permissions to create events (Authorization).\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) were considered but deemed less appropriate than CWE-862. CWE-862 directly addresses the **missing authorization** aspect, whereas CWE-285 and CWE-863 are broader and encompass cases where authorization is attempted but performed incorrectly.\n\nCWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) was considered because it is a commonly found vulnerability. However, the issue isn't with user input being displayed without proper sanitization, but rather a lack of authorization and CSRF protection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
