This is a Class-level CWE. While the retriever results suggested other CWEs, including child CWEs of CWE-863, the provided information does not give enough specificity to go to the Base or Variant level of abstraction.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper permissions checking** during token removal. This leads to the potential for unauthorized actions, as the system **fails** to properly verify if the user has privileges to remove the tokens. The final impact is the disruption of service or unauthorized access to resources.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates an **improper permissions checking** issue during token removal in JetBrains TeamCity. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating the root cause is **improper permissions checks** during token removal, leading to insufficient authorization checks.\n\nBased on this information, CWE-863 \"Incorrect Authorization\" is selected. CWE-863 is a Class-level CWE, and the provided description doesn't go into enough detail to select more specific Base or Variant CWEs. The description of CWE-863 states: \"The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\" This aligns directly with the **improper permissions checking** described in the vulnerability.\n\nThe use of CWE-285 \"Improper Authorization\" was considered, but the mapping guidance discourages its use due to its high level of abstraction, suggesting to \"Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.\" Since the provided information indicates that the authorization check *is* performed, but **incorrectly**, CWE-863 is a better fit than CWE-862.\n\nCWE-732 \"Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\" was also considered. However, the vulnerability is not about the initial assignment of permissions, but about the **incorrect checking** of permissions during token removal. Therefore, CWE-863 is the more appropriate choice.\n\nThe evidence to support the selection of CWE-863 is based on the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\": \"**rootcause:** **improper permissions checking**\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\": \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** **Improper permissions checks** during token removal in TeamCity.\"\n\nThe final selection is CWE-863 as it best represents the vulnerability based on the available information.",
