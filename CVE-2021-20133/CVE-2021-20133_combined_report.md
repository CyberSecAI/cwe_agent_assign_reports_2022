# Analysis for CVE-2021-20133

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-22, which is a Base level CWE, providing a specific description of the path traversal vulnerability. CWE-22 has child CWEs such as CWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal) and CWE-36 (Absolute Path Traversal). The vulnerability description specifically mentions an **absolute path traversal** vulnerability, but CWE-22 encompasses both relative and absolute path traversal, making it the more appropriate choice at the base level. CWE-201 is a related weakness as the path traversal allows the insertion of sensitive information into sent data (the message of the day banner).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper limitation of a pathname** (CWE-22), which enables an attacker to read arbitrary files. This leads to the **insertion of sensitive information into sent data** (CWE-201), as the contents of those files (which might include credentials, configuration files, or private keys) are displayed in the message of the day banner.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified CWE-22 as the primary weakness due to the **absolute path traversal** vulnerability. The selection is strongly based on the provided evidence. The vulnerability description states "Quagga Services on D-Link DIR-2640 less than or equal to version 1.11B02 are affected by an **absolute path traversal** vulnerability". The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section also confirms "Absolute path traversal vulnerability in Quagga Services on D-Link DIR-2640 routers". This makes CWE-22 the most appropriate and specific choice. CWE-201 is included as a secondary weakness.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-20133

## Vulnerability Description
Quagga Services on D-Link DIR-2640 less than or equal to version 1.11B02 are affected by an **absolute path traversal** vulnerability that allows a remote, authenticated attacker to set the message of the day banner to any file on the system, allowing them to read all or some of the contents of those files. Such sensitive information as hashed credentials, hardcoded plaintext passwords for other services, configuration files, and private keys can be disclosed in this fashion. Improper handling of filenames that identify virtual resources, such as /dev/urandom allows an attacker to effect a denial of service attack against the command line interfaces of the Quagga services (zebra and ripd).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **absolute path traversal**
- **impact:** read all or some of the contents of files
- **vector:** improper handling of filenames
- **attacker:** remote authenticated attacker
- **product:** Quagga Services
- **version:** less than or equal to version 1.11B02

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

### Extended Description


Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as ".." and "/" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the "../" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as "/usr/local/bin" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.


### Alternative Terms
Directory traversal
Path traversal: "Path traversal" is preferred over "directory traversal," but both terms are attack-focused.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-706
ChildOf -> CWE-706
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add ".txt" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.

**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.

**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing "/" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).

**[Terminology]** 

Like other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use "directory traversal" only to refer to the injection of ".." and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.


Other variants like "absolute pathname" and "drive letter" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve ".." or equivalent.


**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.

**[Research Gap]** 

Incomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that "..\" is vulnerable, but not test "../" which may also be vulnerable.


Any combination of directory separators ("/", "\", etc.) and numbers of "." (e.g. "....") can produce unique variants; for example, the "//../" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama
- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the "\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)




## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as "/abs/path" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description
This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.

### Alternative Terms

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31503:** Python package constructs filenames using an unsafe os.path.join call on untrusted input, allowing absolute path traversal because os.path.join resets the pathname to an absolute path that is specified as part of the input.
- **CVE-2002-1345:** Multiple FTP clients write arbitrary files via absolute paths in server responses
- **CVE-2001-1269:** ZIP file extractor allows full path




## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
insecure temporary file: Some people use the phrase "insecure temporary file" when referring to a link following weakness, but other weaknesses can produce insecure temporary files without any symlink involvement at all.
Zip Slip: "Zip slip" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).

### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** 

Link following vulnerabilities are Multi-factor Vulnerabilities (MFV). They are the combination of multiple elements: file or directory permissions, filename predictability, race conditions, and in some cases, a design limitation in which there is no mechanism for performing atomic file creation operations.


Some potential factors are race conditions, permissions, and predictability.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.
- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.
- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.




## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description
This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses




## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description


This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.


There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:


  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system("nslookup [HOSTNAME]") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.

  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use "exec([COMMAND])" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.

From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** The "OS command injection" phrase carries different meanings to different people. For some people, it only refers to cases in which the attacker injects command separators into arguments for an application-controlled program that is being invoked. For some people, it refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute OS commands of their own choosing. This usage could include untrusted search path weaknesses (CWE-426) that cause the application to find and execute an attacker-controlled program. Further complicating the issue is the case when argument injection (CWE-88) allows alternate command-line switches or options to be inserted into the command line, such as an "-exec" switch whose purpose may be to execute the subsequent argument as a command (this -exec switch exists in the UNIX "find" command, for example). In this latter case, however, CWE-88 could be regarded as the primary weakness in a chain with CWE-78.

**[Research Gap]** More investigation is needed into the distinction between the OS command injection variants, including the role with argument injection (CWE-88). Equivalent distinctions may exist in other injection-related problems such as SQL injection.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-10987:** OS command injection in Wi-Fi router, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-10221:** Template functionality in network configuration management tool allows OS command injection, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-9054:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in username parameter, leading to OS command injection (CWE-78), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

### Extended Description


When resources are released, they can be made available for reuse. For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.


Even when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.


This weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).

**[Maintenance]** This entry needs modification to clarify the differences with CWE-212. The description also combines two problems that are distinct from the CWE research perspective: the inadvertent transfer of information to another sphere, and improper initialization/shutdown. Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.

**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release
- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.

- **CVE-2022-35411:** Python-based RPC framework enables pickle functionality by default, allowing clients to unpickle untrusted data.




## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.

### Extended Description


A hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:

```
		Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.
		Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.
```
In the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.

The Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry could be split into multiple variants: an inbound variant (as seen in the second demonstrative example) and an outbound variant (as seen in the first demonstrative example).
