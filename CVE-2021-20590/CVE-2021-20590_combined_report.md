## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-287, is a Class-level weakness and a parent of CWE-290. CWE-290 is a Base-level weakness that describes authentication bypass by spoofing, which is a more specific case of improper authentication. Given that the vulnerability description mentions specially crafted packets to gain unauthorized access, and that the CVE summary indicates password authentication bypass, CWE-290 could be considered as a secondary weakness that adds specificity to the **improper authentication**. The relationship influenced the decision to include both CWE-287 and CWE-290, with CWE-287 as the primary due to the explicit mention of **improper authentication** in the vulnerability description.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is as follows:
1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-287 (**Improper Authentication**) exists in the VNC server function.
2.  A remote unauthenticated attacker exploits the **improper authentication** vulnerability by sending specially crafted packets.
3.  **Impact:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the VNC server.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the **improper authentication** vulnerability. The vulnerability description and the CVE summary both explicitly mention **improper authentication** as the root cause.

The CVE reference links content summary states: "The vulnerability is due to **improper authentication** in the VNC server function of Mitsubishi Electric GOT2000 and GOT SIMPLE series devices. Specifically, the vulnerability allows for password authentication bypass."

The Retriever Results list CWE-287 (**Improper Authentication**) as a potential candidate, although it is marked as Discouraged. However, given the explicit mention of **improper authentication**, it is appropriate to include CWE-287.

The Retriever Results also list CWE-290 (**Authentication Bypass by Spoofing**), which is a child of CWE-287. The vulnerability description mentions "specially crafted packets" which aligns with the concept of spoofing. Including CWE-290 provides a more specific classification.

CWE-287 is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly states the **rootcause** is **improper authentication**. CWE-290 is included as a secondary CWE to provide more granularity, given that the vulnerability involves specially crafted packets and password authentication bypass. These selections are based on the evidence provided and an understanding of the relationships between different CWEs.

## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

### Relationships

ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).




## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
This attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1390
ChildOf -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from insufficient verification.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30319:** S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which can be bypassed by a forged IP address.
- **CVE-2009-1048:** VOIP product allows authentication bypass using 127.0.0.1 in the Host header.




## CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
A protocol or its implementation supports interaction between multiple actors and allows those actors to negotiate which algorithm should be used as a protection mechanism such as encryption or authentication, but it does not select the strongest algorithm that is available to both parties.

### Extended Description
When a security mechanism can be forced to downgrade to use a less secure algorithm, this can make it easier for attackers to compromise the product by exploiting weaker algorithm. The victim might not be aware that the less secure algorithm is being used. For example, if an attacker can force a communications channel to use cleartext instead of strongly-encrypted data, then the attacker could read the channel by sniffing, instead of going through extra effort of trying to decrypt the data using brute force techniques.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-693

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is related to CWE-300, although not all downgrade attacks necessarily require an entity that redirects or interferes with the network. See examples.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2006-4302:** Attacker can select an older version of the software to exploit its vulnerabilities.
- **CVE-2006-4407:** Improper prioritization of encryption ciphers during negotiation leads to use of a weaker cipher.
- **CVE-2005-2969:** chain: SSL/TLS implementation disables a verification step (CWE-325) that enables a downgrade attack to a weaker protocol.




## CWE-291: Reliance on IP Address for Authentication
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an IP address for authentication.

### Extended Description
IP addresses can be easily spoofed. Attackers can forge the source IP address of the packets they send, but response packets will return to the forged IP address. To see the response packets, the attacker has to sniff the traffic between the victim machine and the forged IP address. In order to accomplish the required sniffing, attackers typically attempt to locate themselves on the same subnet as the victim machine. Attackers may be able to circumvent this requirement by using source routing, but source routing is disabled across much of the Internet today. In summary, IP address verification can be a useful part of an authentication scheme, but it should not be the single factor required for authentication.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-290
ChildOf -> CWE-923
ChildOf -> CWE-471

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30319:** S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which can be bypassed by a forged IP address.




## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
According to WASC, "Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization."

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-672
ChildOf -> CWE-672
CanPrecede -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.






## CWE-337: Predictable Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) is initialized from a predictable seed, such as the process ID or system time.

### Extended Description
The use of predictable seeds significantly reduces the number of possible seeds that an attacker would need to test in order to predict which random numbers will be generated by the PRNG.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-335

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-7010:** Cloud application on Kubernetes generates passwords using a weak random number generator based on deployment time.
- **CVE-2019-11495:** server uses erlang:now() to seed the PRNG, which results in a small search space for potential random seeds
- **CVE-2008-0166:** The removal of a couple lines of code caused Debian's OpenSSL Package to only use the current process ID for seeding a PRNG




## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.

### Extended Description
If an attacker can manipulate the length parameter associated with an input such that it is inconsistent with the actual length of the input, this can be leveraged to cause the target application to behave in unexpected, and possibly, malicious ways. One of the possible motives for doing so is to pass in arbitrarily large input to the application. Another possible motivation is the modification of application state by including invalid data for subsequent properties of the application. Such weaknesses commonly lead to attacks such as buffer overflows and execution of arbitrary code.

### Alternative Terms
length manipulation
length tampering

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-240
ChildOf -> CWE-119
ChildOf -> CWE-119
CanPrecede -> CWE-805

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This probably overlaps other categories including zero-length issues.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2299:** Web application firewall consumes excessive memory when an HTTP request contains a large Content-Length value but no POST data.
- **CVE-2001-0825:** Buffer overflow in internal string handling routine allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a length argument of zero or less, which disables the length check.




## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-693

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** "origin validation" could fall under this.

**[Maintenance]** The specific ways in which the origin is not properly identified should be laid out as separate weaknesses. In some sense, this is more like a category.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30260:** Distributed Control System (DCS) does not sign firmware images and only relies on insecure checksums for integrity checks
- **CVE-2022-30267:** Distributed Control System (DCS) does not sign firmware images and only relies on insecure checksums for integrity checks
- **CVE-2022-30272:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) does not use signatures for firmware images and relies on insecure checksums
