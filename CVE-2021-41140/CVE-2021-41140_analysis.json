CWE-359, a base-level weakness and a child of CWE-200, is also considered because the leaked data includes reactions, which can be considered private personal information.\nCWE-862 and CWE-863 are both class-level weaknesses and children of CWE-285 Improper Authorization, and are alternatives, depending on whether authorization was missing or incorrectly implemented.\nCWE-525 is a variant-level weakness related to improper caching policies that could lead to exposure of sensitive information.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe525[\"CWE-525: Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe525 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe359,cwe525,cwe862,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Inadequate Access Control**/**Missing Authorization** (The plugin fails to check user permissions before displaying reactions)\n2.  **Exposure of Sensitive Information** (Reactions on private messages/secure topics are visible to unauthorized users).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the analysis focused on the **inadequate access control** as the primary weakness, potentially mapping to CWE-862 or CWE-863. However, the core issue is the **exposure of sensitive information**. The provided information explicitly states \"reactions given by user to secure topics and private messages are visible,\" indicating an information exposure issue. Therefore, CWE-200 is selected as the primary CWE. CWE-359, CWE-525, CWE-862, and CWE-863 are considered as secondary CWEs. The evidence for selecting CWE-200 is: \"reactions given by user to secure topics and private messages are visible\" which directly implies **exposure of sensitive information**. The selection of CWE-200 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the core issue of sensitive information exposure, and it is more general than other more specific exposures.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
