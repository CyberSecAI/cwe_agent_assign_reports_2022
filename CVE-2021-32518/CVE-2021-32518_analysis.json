A related CWE is CWE-73, because the attacker is using an externally controlled file name or path to create the symbolic link. CWE-59 is a child of CWE-706 (Use of Multiple Resources with Different Security Contexts) and has peer relationships with CWE-41, CWE-61, and CWE-62 which are all related to file access and path manipulation. The relationship between CWE-59 and CWE-73 is that CWE-73 can precede CWE-59, meaning that external control of the file name or path can lead to improper link resolution.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    cwe706[\"CWE-706: Use of Multiple Resources with Different Security Contexts\"]\n    cwe41[\"CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\"]\n    cwe61[\"CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\"]\n    cwe62[\"CWE-62: UNIX Hard Link\"]\n\n    cwe59 -->|CHILDOF| cwe706\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe59\n    cwe59 -->|PEEROF| cwe41\n    cwe59 -->|PEEROF| cwe61\n    cwe59 -->|PEEROF| cwe62\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe59 primary\n    class cwe73 secondary\n    class cwe706,cwe41,cwe61,cwe62 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of file paths** (CWE-73), which allows a remote attacker to **create a symbolic link** and then **access arbitrary files** (CWE-59).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed to CWE-59 as the primary weakness, which aligns with the vulnerability description of a symbolic link attack. The retriever results also indicated CWE-59 as the top candidate.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that a remote attacker can **create a symbolic link** then **access arbitrary files**. This aligns with the description of CWE-59 which states: \"The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\"\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-59 can be preceded by CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path), indicating that the attacker's ability to control the file name or path is a contributing factor to the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-59 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level for mapping vulnerabilities. CWE-73 is also at the Base level of abstraction. Both CWEs accurately represent the weakness described in the vulnerability.\n\nBased on the vulnerability description and the retriever results, the selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity and accurately represent the vulnerability.",
