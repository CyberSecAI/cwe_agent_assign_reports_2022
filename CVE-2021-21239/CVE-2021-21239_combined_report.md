## Relationship Analysis

The primary CWE, CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature), is a base-level CWE that directly addresses the **improper verification of cryptographic signature** identified in the vulnerability description. CWE-347 is a child of CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity). CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) is a peer of CWE-322 (Key Exchange without Entity Authentication). CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) is a class-level CWE and parent to CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash) as well as other cryptographic algorithm weaknesses. The relationships informed the decision to prioritize the base-level CWE-347, as it is more specific than the class-level CWE-327.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper verification of cryptographic signature** in PySAML2. This leads to the acceptance of SAML documents that are not correctly signed, potentially due to the insecure default configuration of the underlying `xmlsec1` library. The final impact is an authentication bypass, where an attacker can impersonate a legitimate user.

## Summary of Analysis

The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper verification of cryptographic signatures**. The vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary provide strong evidence for this. The selection of CWE-347 is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly states "**improper verification of cryptographic signature**" as the root cause.

The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary states:
"The vulnerability stems from the `xmlsec1` library's default behavior of accepting any key type for signature verification, instead of strictly adhering to X.509 certificates. `pysaml2` uses `xmlsec1` for SAML signature verification but does not explicitly enforce the use of X.509 certificates."

The graph relationships helped prioritize CWE-347 as the primary CWE because it is a base-level CWE directly addressing the identified weakness, providing a more specific classification than higher-level CWEs like CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) or CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity). While CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) was considered, the issue is broader than just certificate validation, encompassing the overall signature verification process.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause and contributing factors to the vulnerability, based on the provided evidence.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-21239

## Vulnerability Description
PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an **improper verification of cryptographic signature** vulnerability. Users of pysaml2 that use the default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. PySAML2 does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend is using the xmlsec1 binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default xmlsec1 accepts any type of key found within the given document. xmlsec1 needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification process of the SAML document signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper verification of cryptographic signature**
- **product:** PySAML2
- **version:** before 6.5.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21239:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `xmlsec1` library's default behavior of accepting any key type for signature verification, instead of strictly adhering to X.509 certificates.  `pysaml2` uses `xmlsec1` for SAML signature verification but does not explicitly enforce the use of X.509 certificates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Default Configuration:** `xmlsec1`'s default behavior is to accept various key types, including those specified within the XML document itself (e.g., `<KeyValue>`). This allows an attacker to potentially use a different key than expected to sign a SAML document, which would still validate.
- **Lack of Explicit Key Type Enforcement:** `pysaml2`, by default, did not explicitly configure `xmlsec1` to only use X.509 certificates for verification. It relied on the insecure default behavior of the underlying library.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can craft a malicious SAML document with a signature generated by an attacker-controlled key. Since the `xmlsec1` default behavior validates this signature even if an unrelated public key is explicitly provided, the malicious SAML document can bypass authentication and impersonate a legitimate user.
- **Security Breach:** Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to resources protected by the SAML authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks:** An attacker intercepting a legitimate SAML response can replace the signature with one generated using a key under their control. If the recipient uses a vulnerable version of pysaml2, then this malformed response would be accepted.
- **Malicious IdP:** A compromised or malicious Identity Provider (IdP) can issue a malicious SAML response with an attacker-controlled key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to intercept or generate a SAML document:** An attacker needs to be able to either intercept a legitimate SAML document or craft a new one.
- **Access to a key-pair:** The attacker needs to possess a private key that they can use to generate a malicious signature, and a corresponding public key.
- **Target uses a vulnerable version of `pysaml2`:** The target service needs to use a version of `pysaml2` (<= 6.4.1) that relies on the vulnerable `xmlsec1` default behavior.

**Additional Information from the provided documents:**
- The github commit diff shows the fix: The `--enabled-key-data raw-x509-cert` parameter was added to the xmlsec1 command in `src/saml2/sigver.py` to force it to only accept x509 certificates.
- The `test_xmlsec1_key_data.py` file shows how the vulnerability is tested, by attempting to verify documents using HMAC keys, or embedded x509 certs, and those tests should fail after the fix.
- The mailing list discussion highlights how `xmlsec1` prefers the `KeyValue` element over explicitly provided public keys and how to limit the key data types accepted by the library.
- The GitHub security advisory confirms the impact, affected versions, patched versions, and provides a link to the mailing list thread discussing the underlying xmlsec1 issue.
- The debian security advisory confirms that this is an issue and references CVE-2021-21239, and that it has been fixed in the debian package.

- **CVE-2005-2182:** Insufficient verification allows spoofing.




## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

### Extended Description


A hash function is defined as an algorithm that maps arbitrarily sized data into a fixed-sized digest (output) such that the following properties hold:


  1. The algorithm is not invertible (also called "one-way" or "not reversible")

  1. The algorithm is deterministic; the same input produces the same digest every time

 Building on this definition, a cryptographic hash function must also ensure that a malicious actor cannot leverage the hash function to have a reasonable chance of success at determining any of the following:

  1. the original input (preimage attack), given only the digest

  1. another input that can produce the same digest (2nd preimage attack), given the original input

  1. a set of two or more inputs that evaluate to the same digest (birthday attack), given the actor can arbitrarily choose the inputs to be hashed and can do so a reasonable amount of times

What is regarded as "reasonable" varies by context and threat model, but in general, "reasonable" could cover any attack that is more efficient than brute force (i.e., on average, attempting half of all possible combinations). Note that some attacks might be more efficient than brute force but are still not regarded as achievable in the real world.

Any algorithm that does not meet the above conditions will generally be considered weak for general use in hashing.


In addition to algorithmic weaknesses, a hash function can be made weak by using the hash in a security context that breaks its security guarantees. For example, using a hash function without a salt for storing passwords (that are sufficiently short) could enable an adversary to create a "rainbow table" [REF-637] to recover the password under certain conditions; this attack works against such hash functions as MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2.

## CWE-1270: Generation of Incorrect Security Tokens
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product implements a Security Token mechanism to differentiate what actions are allowed or disallowed when a transaction originates from an entity. However, the Security Tokens generated in the system are incorrect.

### Extended Description


Systems-On-a-Chip (SoC) (Integrated circuits and hardware engines) implement Security Tokens to differentiate and identify actions originated from various agents. These actions could be "read", "write", "program", "reset", "fetch", "compute", etc. Security Tokens are generated and assigned to every agent on the SoC that is either capable of generating an action or receiving an action from another agent. Every agent could be assigned a unique, Security Token based on its trust level or privileges. Incorrectly generated Security Tokens could result in the same token used for multiple agents or multiple tokens being used for the same agent. This condition could result in a Denial-of-Service (DoS) or the execution of an action that in turn could result in privilege escalation or unintended access.

## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

### Extended Description
In security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Often primary in cryptographic applications and algorithms.

**[Maintenance]** CWE 4.16 removed a demonstrative example for a hardware module because it was inaccurate and unable to be adapted. The CWE team is developing an alternative.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies
- **CVE-2019-10482:** Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels
- **CVE-2014-0984:** Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.




## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.

- **CVE-2008-3775:** Product uses "ROT-25" to obfuscate the password in the registry.




## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

### Extended Description


XML documents optionally contain a Document Type Definition (DTD), which, among other features, enables the definition of XML entities. It is possible to define an entity by providing a substitution string in the form of a URI. The XML parser can access the contents of this URI and embed these contents back into the XML document for further processing.


By submitting an XML file that defines an external entity with a file:// URI, an attacker can cause the processing application to read the contents of a local file. For example, a URI such as "file:///c:/winnt/win.ini" designates (in Windows) the file C:\Winnt\win.ini, or file:///etc/passwd designates the password file in Unix-based systems. Using URIs with other schemes such as http://, the attacker can force the application to make outgoing requests to servers that the attacker cannot reach directly, which can be used to bypass firewall restrictions or hide the source of attacks such as port scanning.


Once the content of the URI is read, it is fed back into the application that is processing the XML. This application may echo back the data (e.g. in an error message), thereby exposing the file contents.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-610
ChildOf -> CWE-610
PeerOf -> CWE-441

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** CWE-918 (SSRF) and CWE-611 (XXE) are closely related, because they both involve web-related technologies and can launch outbound requests to unexpected destinations. However, XXE can be performed client-side, or in other contexts in which the software is not acting directly as a server, so the "Server" portion of the SSRF acronym does not necessarily apply.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-42745:** Recruiter software allows reading arbitrary files using XXE
- **CVE-2005-1306:** A browser control can allow remote attackers to determine the existence of files via Javascript containing XML script.
- **CVE-2012-5656:** XXE during SVG image conversion




## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.

### Extended Description


Even if a certificate is well-formed, signed, and follows the chain of trust, it may simply be a valid certificate for a different site than the site that the product is interacting with. If the certificate's host-specific data is not properly checked - such as the Common Name (CN) in the Subject or the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension of an X.509 certificate - it may be possible for a redirection or spoofing attack to allow a malicious host with a valid certificate to provide data, impersonating a trusted host. In order to ensure data integrity, the certificate must be valid and it must pertain to the site that is being accessed.


Even if the product attempts to check the hostname, it is still possible to incorrectly check the hostname. For example, attackers could create a certificate with a name that begins with a trusted name followed by a NUL byte, which could cause some string-based comparisons to only examine the portion that contains the trusted name.


This weakness can occur even when the product uses Certificate Pinning, if the product does not verify the hostname at the time a certificate is pinned.
