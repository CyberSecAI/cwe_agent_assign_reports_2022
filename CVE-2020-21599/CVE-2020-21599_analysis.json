CWE-122 **Heap-based Buffer Overflow** is a variant of CWE-787 and is considered as a secondary CWE as the buffer is allocated in the heap memory. CWE-119 **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer** is a class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-787. While it broadly applies, it is less specific than CWE-787.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nINSERT the chain of root cause and weaknesses that followed for the Vulnerability Description.\n  - Map the sequence from initial flaw to final impact\n  - Identify which CWEs represent root causes vs. impacts\n  - Note any missing links in the chain based on relationship data\n\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the processing of a crafted file, leading to a **heap buffer overflow** (CWE-122), which is a specific type of **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787). The ultimate impact is denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nINSERT your analysis of both the initial analysis and criticism and your resulting conclusion.\n  - Highlight how much your assessment is based on the provided evidence only, and show or quote that evidence.\n  - Explain how the graph relationships influenced your final selection\n  - Provide clear justification for your decision\n  - Explain why your selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity\n\nThe primary weakness is a **heap buffer overflow** in the `de265_imageavailable_zscan` function, as stated in the vulnerability description: \"libde265 v1.0.4 contains a **heap buffer overflow** in the de265_imageavailable_zscan function\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this, stating: \"The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow located in the `de265_image::available_zscan` function within the libde265 library.\"\n\nCWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write** is the most accurate base-level representation of the vulnerability, aligning with the description of writing data beyond the allocated buffer. CWE-122 **Heap-based Buffer Overflow** provides more specific information about where the buffer is allocated and is a variant of CWE-787. CWE-119 **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer** is a more general class.\n\nThe decision to prioritize CWE-787 is based on its direct relevance to the **out-of-bounds write** condition. While CWE-122 accurately captures the heap allocation aspect, CWE-787 represents the fundamental flaw.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
