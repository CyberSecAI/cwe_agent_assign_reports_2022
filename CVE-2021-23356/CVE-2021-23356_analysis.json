It is a child of CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements) and CWE-74. CWE-74 is a Class level weakness, representing a more general case of injection. CWE-20 represents a failure to validate input, which can often precede injection vulnerabilities.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe78\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of input sanitization**, which leads to **OS command injection**, allowing the attacker to **execute arbitrary commands**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-78 as the primary weakness due to the **use of the child_process exec function without input sanitization**, which directly leads to command injection. The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section clearly states: \"rootcause: **use of the child_process exec function without input sanitization**\" and \"impact: execute arbitrary commands\". This is further supported by the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** which states: \"The `kill-process-by-name` package uses the `child_process.exec` function without sanitizing user-provided input, leading to arbitrary command injection.\"\n\nThe Retriever Results also lists CWE-78 as a potential match.\n\nCWE-78 is a more specific, base-level CWE, making it a better fit than its parent CWE-74, which is a class. While CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) could be considered a contributing factor, the core issue is the **lack of sanitization** when executing the OS command, making CWE-78 the more direct and appropriate classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
