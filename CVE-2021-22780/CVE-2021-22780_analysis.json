This CWE is a class-level weakness related to insufficient protection of credentials. While it has child CWEs, there isn't enough information in the vulnerability description to specify exactly which child CWE would be a better fit. CWE-311 is a class-level weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weaknesses in Authentication or Authorization Protocol\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe311 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe522 primary\n    class cwe1390,cwe287,cwe668,cwe311,cwe693 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Insufficiently Protected Credentials**, leading to unauthorized access to the project file. The attacker can bypass the password protection, view, and modify the project file.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the root cause is \"**Insufficiently Protected Credentials**\". The impact is that an attacker may bypass the password protection and be able to view and modify a project file.\n\nCWE-522 **Insufficiently Protected Credentials** is the best fit because it directly reflects the stated weakness. The retriever results also list this CWE as the top match. While CWE-522 is a Class-level CWE, there isn't sufficient detail to choose a more specific Base-level CWE. Therefore, the Class level is appropriate.\n\nCWE-311 **Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data** was considered because encryption is a common method of protecting credentials. However, the description doesn't explicitly state that the credentials were not encrypted. It's possible that the credentials were encrypted, but the encryption method was weak or improperly implemented. Since encryption is not mentioned, this is a less appropriate fit.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision comes directly from the vulnerability description: \"**Insufficiently Protected Credentials** vulnerability exists in EcoStruxure Control Expert...that could cause unauthorized access to a project file protected by a password when this file is shared with untrusted sources. An attacker may bypass the password protection and be able to view and modify a project file.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5716.29\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks",
