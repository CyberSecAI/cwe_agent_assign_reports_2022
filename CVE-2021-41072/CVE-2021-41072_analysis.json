CWE-61 **UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following** is a compound CWE, which is related to CWE-59 as it is a child of CWE-59. CWE-22 **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** represents a different type of path manipulation issue, and is included as a secondary candidate because directory traversal is mentioned as an exploit in the description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n    cwe61[\"CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    \n    cwe61 -->|CHILDOF| cwe59\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe59 primary\n    class cwe61,cwe22 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the creation of a symbolic link followed by a write operation that passes through the link to an unintended location.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** The application does not properly validate filenames, allowing symlinks to be created.\n2.  **Weakness:** The application follows the symbolic link when writing a file with the same name, resulting in an arbitrary file write.\n3.  **Impact:** Arbitrary file write on the file system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **improper handling of symbolic links**, which allows writing to unintended locations. The analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description and the provided CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The core issue revolves around the ability to write through a symbolic link, making CWE-59 the most appropriate primary classification. CWE-61 is considered since it's directly related to symlink usage. The high retriever scores of CWE-59, CWE-61 and CWE-22 also support this conclusion. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-59 being a base-level weakness and CWE-61 a compound weakness providing additional context. The evidence clearly supports the **symlink creation** and the **write through symbolic link** as the root cause and impact, respectively.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
