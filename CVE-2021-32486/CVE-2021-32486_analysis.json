CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-787, which in turn is a child of CWE-119. Given the specific nature of the **heap buffer overflow** mentioned in the vulnerability description, CWE-122 is the most specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **heap buffer overflow** (CWE-122), which leads to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787), ultimately resulting in a system crash and remote denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards CWE-787 as the primary match, which aligns with the top CWEs for similar CVE descriptions. However, the vulnerability description specifically mentions a \"**heap buffer overflow**\". Therefore, CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a more precise classification.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision comes directly from the \"**Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**\" which pinpoint the **rootcause** as a \"**heap buffer overflow**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also reinforces this by stating that the **root cause of vulnerability** is a **heap-based buffer overflow**.\n\nCWE-122 is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level for mapping root causes. It's a child of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), which is a more general description of the issue. The selection of CWE-122 provides a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-119 was considered as a potential candidate but was rejected as it is too generic. The mapping guidance for CWE-119 discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## Vulnerability Description\nIn modem 2G RRM, there is a possible system crash due to a **heap buffer overflow**. This could lead to remote denial of service with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.

If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis typically occurs when the software copies data of a fixed length into a buffer that is too small to hold it, resulting in a write past the end of the buffer.\n\nWhile the terms \"buffer overflow",
