This can lead to a secondary weakness, **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)**, because the integer overflow results in a smaller-than-expected memory allocation. The **CWE-190** is a **Base** level weakness, and **CWE-122** is a **Variant** of **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)**. **CWE-190** can **CanPrecede** **CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer)**. **CWE-122** is a specific type of **CWE-787**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n    class cwe787,cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with an **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)** due to unchecked addition arithmetic. This leads to an undersized memory allocation and subsequently a **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)** when data is written to the buffer using the original, non-truncated size.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis identified **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)** as the primary root cause because the **integer overflow** directly leads to the subsequent **heap-based buffer overflow**. The vulnerability description clearly states: \"A specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an **integer overflow** due to unchecked addition arithmetic resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption.\" The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** reinforces this, stating: \"An integer overflow occurs when parsing the \"svhd\" atom in the GPAC library, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.\"\n\n**CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)** is classified as a secondary weakness. While the buffer overflow is the direct consequence and impact, the root cause is the **integer overflow** that creates the condition for it.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-190** is supported by the retriever results, which list it as the top combined result. **CWE-122** is also listed in the retriever results.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports these classifications. **CWE-190** accurately represents the root cause, while **CWE-122** describes the resulting vulnerability. The **Base** abstraction level for **CWE-190** and the **Variant** level for **CWE-122** are appropriate because they provide the right level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation to determine how much memory to allocate, but an integer overflow can occur that causes less memory to be allocated than expected, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a named chain, which combines multiple weaknesses.\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
