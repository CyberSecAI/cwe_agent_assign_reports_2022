CWE-776 directly addresses the **XML entity expansion** vulnerability. CWE-400 is a class-level CWE and is too general but is a potential impact of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe776[\"CWE-776: Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')\"]\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    cwe405[\"CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe776 -->|CHILDOF| cwe674\n    cwe776 -->|CHILDOF| cwe405\n    cwe400 -->|ParentOF| cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400 -->|ParentOF| cwe772[\"CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe400 -->|ParentOF| cwe410[\"CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool\"]\n    cwe400 -->|ParentOF| cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\"]\n\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe776 primary\n    class cwe674,cwe405,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper restriction of recursive entity references in DTDs (CWE-776)**, leading to high CPU and memory consumption and ultimately resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-776 as the primary weakness due to the **XML entity expansion** root cause. The final decision is based on the evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section, which explicitly mentions \"**XML entity expansion**\". The retriever results also list CWE-776 as the top combined result.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates an **XML entity expansion** vulnerability. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-776, which states, \"The product uses XML documents and allows their structure to be defined with a Document Type Definition (DTD), but it does not properly control the number of recursive definitions of entities.\" The resulting high CPU and memory consumption leading to a denial of service is also consistent with the extended description of CWE-776. Therefore, CWE-776 is the most specific and appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nCWE-400 was considered as a secondary CWE since the **impact** of the vulnerability is a denial of service due to uncontrolled resource consumption. However, CWE-400 is a class-level CWE and is too general. The root cause is the **XML entity expansion**, which is more accurately captured by CWE-776.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or
