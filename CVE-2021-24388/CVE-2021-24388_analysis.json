CWE-352, a Compound CWE, is a secondary weakness because the vulnerability description highlights the **lack of CSRF protection** when saving settings, which allows attackers to inject XSS payloads. CWE-79 and CWE-352 are PeerOf each other.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n\n    cwe79 -- PEEROF --> cwe352\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe352 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Lack of CSRF Protection (CWE-352):** An attacker can trick an admin into making unintended requests.\n2.  **Improper Neutralization of Input (CWE-79):** The application fails to sanitize or escape user input, particularly the \"Field Name\" option.\n3.  **Stored XSS:** The malicious script is saved in the database.\n4.  **Impact:** When a user views the page, the malicious script is executed in their browser, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis identified two main weaknesses: Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CWE-352). The primary weakness is CWE-79 because the **lack of sanitization or escaping of user input** directly leads to the XSS vulnerability. The secondary weakness is CWE-352 because the **lack of CSRF protection** allows an attacker to inject the XSS payload into the settings. The evidence is strong as the vulnerability description explicitly states the **lack of sanitization or escaping of user input** and the **lack of CSRF protection**.\n> \"However, the field name is not sanitised or escaped before being output back in the page, leading to a stored Cross-Site Scripting issue. There is also no CSRF check done before saving the setting, allowing attackers to make a logged in admin set arbitrary Custom Fields, including one with XSS payload in it.\"\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-79 and CWE-352 are PeerOf each other. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity as CWE-79 is a Base level CWE and CWE-352 is a Compound level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*Not Selected:* CWE-74 is too high-level as the specific injection is Cross-Site Scripting.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This vulnerability is not about inserting sensitive information into files.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* While related to web parameters, the core issue is improper sanitization leading to XSS and a **lack of CSRF protection**.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
