CWE-312, in turn, is a child of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data). This hierarchical relationship helped to narrow down the most specific CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe317[\"CWE-317: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in GUI\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    \n    cwe317 -->|CHILDOF| cwe312\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe317 primary\n    class cwe312 secondary\n    class cwe311 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **cleartext storage of sensitive information** in the GUI, which leads to a remote authenticated attacker being able to retrieve sensitive information by deobfuscating the password entry fields.\n\nRoot Cause: **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** in the GUI (CWE-317)\nImpact: Remote authenticated attacker can retrieve sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-317 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in GUI) because the vulnerability description specifically states \"**cleartext storage of sensitive information** in GUI\". The evidence is strong because the \"**rootcause:** **cleartext storage of sensitive information**\" is explicitly mentioned in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" indicates that user passwords (LDAP), RADIUS shared secret, and the Elastic Cloud database password are not properly encrypted in the GUI.\n\nCWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) was considered as a secondary CWE because it is a more general form of CWE-317. However, since the vulnerability is specifically related to the GUI, CWE-317 is a better fit.\n\nCWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) was also considered because the root cause involves the lack of encryption. However, CWE-312 and CWE-317 are more specific and thus more appropriate. The MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-311 in favor of its more specific children.\nThe retriever also suggests the use of the lowest level that matches, so I am choosing the variant.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.84\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-316: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext in memory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.

In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders.
