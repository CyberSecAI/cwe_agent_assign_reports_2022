CWE-862 is a more specific case of CWE-285, where authorization is completely missing. The analysis also considered CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) but determined that the described scenario fits better with the absence of authorization checks rather than an incorrect implementation. CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery) was considered as a secondary weakness due to the lack of nonce verification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe352 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe863,cwe613 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **unprotected AJAX endpoints** (CWE-862), which leads to students being able to modify course information and elevate their privileges. The **missing** authorization checks on the `tutor_add_instructor` AJAX action is the direct root cause. If CSRF protection via nonce verification is also **missing**, then CWE-352 may also be present.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference content summary. The key evidence is: \"**unprotected AJAX endpoints**\", \"**Missing Capability Checks**,\" and \"**Privilege Escalation**.\"\n\nThe primary selection is CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) because the plugin **lacked proper checks to verify if the user had the necessary permissions**. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-862: \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\" This is at the Class level, but the retriever results, and the CWE specifications indicate that no child is a better fit.\n\nCWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a secondary consideration since there was no nonce verification (which protects against CSRF).\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): While related, the vulnerability is due to the complete absence of authorization checks, not an incorrect implementation.\n*   CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key): This CWE is about modifying a key to access another user's data, which is not the primary issue here.\n*   CWE-472 (External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter): This is about modifying parameters that are assumed to be immutable, which is not the core issue here.\n*   CWE-471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)): Similar to CWE-472, this is not the central problem.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as CWE-862 directly represents the **missing** authorization and its consequences. CWE-352 is a secondary consideration because of the **lack of nonce verification**.",
