While it aligns with the **improper access control** root cause, its discouraged usage suggests considering more specific descendants. CWE-200 **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**, is a Class-level CWE and a potential impact of the vulnerability. The relationship between these CWEs helped refine the classification, prioritizing the root cause while acknowledging the potential information exposure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe284 -->|CHILD| cwe863\n    cwe284 -->|CHILD| cwe862\n    cwe284 -->|CHILD| cwe732\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe668,cwe863,cwe862,cwe732 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control** (CWE-284). This leads to an authenticated attacker with a restricted user profile being able to retrieve the list of administrative users of other ADOMs and their related configurations, which results in **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **improper access control** as the root cause, aligning with the vulnerability description and key phrases. The CVE reference links content summary reinforced this by stating that the root cause of the vulnerability is **improper access control** in the FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer GUI interface.\n\nThe Retriever Results highlighted CWE-284 **Improper Access Control** as the top candidate. However, the mapping guidance for CWE-284 discourages its use due to its high-level nature. It suggests considering more specific descendants such as CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**, CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization**, or CWE-732 **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource**. While these are more specific, the description indicates a general **improper access control** issue rather than a specific authorization or permission problem. Therefore, while acknowledging its limitations, CWE-284 is chosen due to the lack of sufficient evidence to pinpoint a more specific cause.\n\nCWE-200 **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** is considered as a secondary weakness, as the **improper access control** leads to the retrieval of sensitive information. However, as the mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-200 as a primary cause, due to it being a technical impact, it is only added as a secondary candidate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability is not related to HTTP request/response smuggling.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE is not applicable because the issue isn't about exposing a resource to the wrong sphere, but rather an access control issue allowing unauthorized retrieval of information.\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE is not applicable since it deals with improper neutralization of CRLF sequences, which is not related to the described vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability does not involve injection of special elements.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability isn't about failing to remove sensitive information before storage or transfer, but about unauthorized access to begin with.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE is not applicable, as the vulnerability is not about relying on untrusted inputs for security decisions.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability doesn't involve path equivalence issues.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE is not applicable, as the vulnerability doesn't involve limiting interaction frequency.\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability doesn't stem from improper isolation or compartmentalization.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE is not applicable since the vulnerability doesn't involve handling insufficient permissions or privileges.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 6240.35\n**Source**: sparse\nThis CWE is a potential impact of the vulnerability, as the **improper access control** leads to the retrieval of sensitive information. However, as the mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-200 as a primary cause, due to it being a technical impact, it is not selected.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 6180.73\n**Source**: sparse\nThis is a more specific child of CWE-284 and could be applicable. However, there is no specific evidence about an incorrect authorization check, only about a general access control issue.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6072.18\n**Source**: sparse\nThis CWE is not applicable, as the vulnerability doesn't involve bypassing authorization through user-controlled keys.\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 6062.76\n**Source**: sparse\nThis CWE is similar to CWE-863, but still requires more specific evidence about authorization checks.\n\n## CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5976.21\n**Source**: sparse\nThis CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability is not related to HTTP request/response smuggling.\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\nThis CWE is not applicable, as the vulnerability isn't about inserting sensitive information into sent data.\n\n## CWE-1272: Sensitive Information Uncleared Before Debug/Power State Transition\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\nThis CWE is not applicable because the issue isn't related to debug or power state transitions.\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: base",
