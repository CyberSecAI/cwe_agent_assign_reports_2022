The vulnerability results in an infinite loop, making CWE-835 a more specific and appropriate choice than CWE-834. Additionally, **CWE-1287 (Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input)** is related as the **lack of input validation** leads to the infinite loop.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe835[\"CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\"]\n    cwe1287[\"CWE-1287: Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input\"]\n\n    cwe835 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    cwe1287 -->|CAUSES| cwe835\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe835 primary\n    class cwe1287 secondary\n    class cwe834 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-1287 (Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input)**, which allows malformed data (strings instead of numbers) to be processed. This then leads to **CWE-835 (Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop'))**, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **CWE-835 (Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition)** as the primary weakness due to the direct evidence of an infinite loop in the vulnerability description. The **root cause** of the issue is the **lack of input validation**, leading to the loop. The selection is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description, specifically the phrases \"**infinite loop** is possible when the cumulative-distribution-function is evaluated for a given point when the input data is string data rather than type `number`\".\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the connection between improper input validation and the infinite loop.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because **CWE-835 (Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition)** directly represents the resulting infinite loop, and **CWE-1287 (Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input)** accurately identifies the underlying cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an iteration or loop without sufficiently limiting the number of times that the loop is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Analysis:** While the vulnerability does involve a loop, **CWE-835 (Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition)** is a more specific child that explicitly describes an infinite loop. Therefore, CWE-834 is less appropriate.\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Analysis:** Although the infinite loop results in inefficient computation, the root cause is not the algorithm itself but rather the lack of input validation. Therefore, **CWE-407** is not the primary issue.\n\n## CWE-606: Unchecked Input for Loop Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Analysis:** While relevant as a contributing factor, **CWE-1287 (Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input)** more directly addresses the **lack of type validation**, making it a better fit than **CWE-606**, which focuses on loop conditions more generally.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Analysis:** **CWE-667** is not relevant to this vulnerability, which is related to input validation and loop conditions rather than locking mechanisms.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Analysis:** **CWE-799** does not apply as the vulnerability isn't related to interaction frequency but to the handling of specific malformed inputs causing an infinite loop.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Analysis:** **CWE-1289** is not a good fit. The vulnerability isn't about validating equivalence but about validating the *type* of input.\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Analysis:** While the lack of type validation could be considered an improper check for exceptional conditions, **CWE-1287 (Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input)** is more specific and therefore a better fit.\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n**Analysis:** **CWE-703** is too general and not appropriate given the availability of more specific CWEs like **CWE-1287 (Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input)**.\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a",
