## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-121 which is a child of CWE-788 and CWE-787. CWE-787 is also a parent of CWE-124. CWE-119 is a parent of CWE-125, CWE-120 and others. CWE-119 is a class level CWE and is too general. CWE-121 is a Variant and is more specific.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of root cause and weaknesses that followed for the Vulnerability Description:
  - The application had a **stack based buffer overflow**.
  - An adversary would potentially have been able to execute arbitrary code with system privileges.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states a "**stack based buffer overflow**". The Retriever Results listed CWE-121 as the third ranked option. The first ranked option was CWE-119 which is too general. The description for CWE-121 states: "A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function)."
The evidence supports CWE-121 as the primary CWE. The next option to consider was CWE-119 because CWE-121 is a child of CWE-119. However, the MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-119 and recommends a more specific CWE.
The other top combined results were CWE-190, CWE-126, CWE-120, CWE-250, CWE-128, CWE-193, CWE-125, and CWE-1284. These are not a good match based on the vulnerability description.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
When converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6513.90
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 623
