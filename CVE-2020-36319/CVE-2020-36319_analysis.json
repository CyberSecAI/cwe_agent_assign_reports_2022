CWE-1188 is a child of CWE-1419 (Initialization Problems) and CWE-665 (Improper Initialization). The vulnerability involves an insecure default configuration of the ObjectMapper, making CWE-1188 the most specific and appropriate choice. CWE-200 is a class-level CWE representing the impact of the insecure default, but it's less specific than CWE-1188 regarding the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1188[\"CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default\"]\n    cwe1419[\"CWE-1419: Initialization Problems\"]\n    cwe665[\"CWE-665: Improper Initialization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe1188 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1419\n    cwe1188 -->|CHILDOF| cwe665\n    cwe200 -->|RESULT| cwe1188\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1188 primary\n    class cwe1419,cwe665,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure configuration of the default ObjectMapper** (CWE-1188), which leads to the potential to **expose sensitive data** (CWE-200) through JSON responses.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to **CWE-1188 Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default** as the primary weakness. The `ObjectMapper` was configured **insecurely by default**, leading to the exposure of sensitive data. The evidence for this is found in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\": \"The vulnerability stems from the **insecure configuration of the default `ObjectMapper`** in Vaadin Flow server.\"\n\nThe graph relationships support this selection as CWE-1188 is a specific Base CWE, while CWE-200 is a Class CWE representing the resulting impact. The selection of CWE-1188 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **insecure default initialization**.\n\nCWE-200 was considered but ultimately deemed a secondary concern, representing the potential impact rather than the root cause. The mapping guidance for CWE-668 discourages its use as it is a high-level class.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
