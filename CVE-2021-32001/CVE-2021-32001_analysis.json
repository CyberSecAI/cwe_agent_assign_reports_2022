While CWE-327 is a class-level CWE, it's considered as a potential secondary issue if the empty string is indeed a known, risky algorithm. CWE-1394 is also considered as a potential secondary issue if the empty string can be regarded as a default cryptographic key.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1394[\"CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n\n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe327 -->|PEEROF| cwe319\n    cwe1394 -->|PEEROF| cwe319\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe327,cwe1394 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses starts with the **lack of proper encryption** when no token is provided, leading to sensitive data being transmitted in cleartext.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-319 as the primary weakness because the core issue is that sensitive bootstrap data is exposed due to the **lack of encryption**, resulting in the cleartext transmission of that data. This is supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary which states: \"The vulnerability is that the bootstrap data is not properly encrypted if no token is provided by the user, effectively resulting in no encryption of the data.\"\nThe vulnerability description states that an attacker with access to the datastore can \"extract the clusters confidential keying material... and decrypt it, without having to know the token value,\".\n\nCWE-327 and CWE-1394 were considered as secondary issues. If the empty string encryption is considered a risky algorithm, then CWE-327 would be appropriate. If the empty string is considered a default key, then CWE-1394 would be appropriate. However, the primary issue is the **lack of encryption**, making CWE-319 more accurate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-319 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause: the **cleartext transmission** of sensitive data due to the **lack of proper encryption**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
