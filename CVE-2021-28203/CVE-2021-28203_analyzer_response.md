# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2021-28203

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that CWE-78 is a Base level CWE, making it more specific than its Class parent, CWE-77. It accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability, which involves the injection of OS commands.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with the **failure to filter a specific parameter** within the Web Set Media Image function. This **lack of filtering** allows remote attackers with administrator privileges to inject OS commands. The injected commands are then executed, resulting in arbitrary command execution on the ASUS BMCs.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment and final conclusion are based on the provided vulnerability description, which clearly indicates a **command injection** vulnerability. The key phrase "**does not filter the specific parameter**" directly points to the root cause, and the impact is that remote attackers can execute arbitrary commands.

The graph relationships confirm that CWE-78 is a specific type of command injection, focusing on OS commands, which aligns with the evidence. The retriever results also strongly support the selection of CWE-78, with a high similarity score.

The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately represents the root cause (improper neutralization) and the affected domain (OS commands). The description explicitly states that remote attackers can "launch **command injection** to execute command arbitrarily," which aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-78.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-791: Incomplete Filtering of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an upstream component, but does not completely filter special elements before sending it to a downstream component.
