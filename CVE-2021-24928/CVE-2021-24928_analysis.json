CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] is a child of CWE-285 [CWE-285: Improper Authorization]. The selection of CWE-89 is preferred due to its base level of abstraction and direct match with the **SQL injection** vulnerability. CWE-862 is also relevant due to the **improper access controls**, but less directly related than the **SQL injection** itself. The graph relationships confirm that CWE-89 is a common weakness type, further solidifying the choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe862,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access controls** and lack of validation of user input which leads to the **SQL injection**. The impact is that an attacker can modify arbitrary post content and exfiltrate data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **SQL injection** as the primary vulnerability due to the lack of validation and escaping of user-supplied data. The retriever results strongly support CWE-89 [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')], with a score of 1.0. The vulnerability description also mentions **improper access controls**, which suggests a secondary weakness related to authorization.\n\nThe final decision is to map the vulnerability to CWE-89 [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] as the primary CWE, given the strong evidence and retriever score. Additionally, CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] is included as a secondary CWE due to the **improper access controls**.\n\nCWE-79 [CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] was considered because the impact includes the ability to inject XSS payloads, but this is a consequence of the **SQL injection**, not a separate vulnerability. CWE-352 [CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] was also considered but deemed not applicable because there's no mention of CSRF in the vulnerability description. CWE-434 [CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type] was not considered because the vulnerability description doesn't involve file uploads.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-89 [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] directly addresses the **SQL injection** issue, and CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] highlights the **improper access controls**.",
