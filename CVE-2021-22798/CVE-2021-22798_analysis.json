CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) can also be related as a potential cause or contributing factor. Selecting CWE-523 provides a more specific classification than the broader CWE-522.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe523[\"CWE-523: Unprotected Transport of Credentials\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe523 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe523 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe319\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe523 primary\n    class cwe319,cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Insufficiently Protected Credentials**, leading to the **exposure of sensitive data** via **network sniffing**. The root cause is the unprotected transport of credentials, which allows attackers to intercept the data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, driven by the vulnerability description's key phrase \"**Insufficiently Protected Credentials**,\" pointed towards CWE-522. However, the description elaborates on **sensitive data (login credentials) being exposed via network sniffing**. This strongly suggests the credentials are being transmitted without adequate protection.\n\nCWE-523 (Unprotected Transport of Credentials) aligns more accurately with this scenario. It is a child of CWE-522, providing greater specificity. The retriever results also list CWE-523 with a high score.\n\nCWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is also considered as a secondary CWE because the description mentions credentials being exposed via network sniffing which implies the data is being transmitted in cleartext.\n\nTherefore, the primary CWE is CWE-523, with CWE-319 and CWE-522 as secondary considerations.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
