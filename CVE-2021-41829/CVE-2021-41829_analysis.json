CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is related because using a default key is similar to not encrypting at all, since the key is publicly known. We chose CWE-1394 as the primary because it directly addresses the vulnerability's root cause: reliance on a default key for encryption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1394[\"CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Predictable Key\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe1394 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1392\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1394 primary\n    class cwe312 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a default cryptographic key** (CWE-1394). Because the encryption key is derived from the application's build number, this makes it predictable. This predictable key leads to the ability to decrypt the backup files, which contain **sensitive information stored in a way that is now accessible** (CWE-312).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The key points are:\n\n*   \"The ManageEngine Remote Access Plus application uses the build number of the application to calculate a password/key.\"\n*   \"This credential derivation method is hardcoded within the source code (specifically in the `DCBackupRestore.jar` file).\"\n*   \"The hardcoded key is used to encrypt backup files.\"\n*   \"An attacker can obtain the static key by reverse engineering the application and then use it to decrypt backup files.\"\n*   \"The backup files contain sensitive data\"\n\nThis evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-1394 as the primary weakness because the **root cause** is the **use of a default cryptographic key**. The fact that the backup files contain sensitive data and can be decrypted due to the weak key supports the secondary mapping to CWE-312 as a consequence.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1394 is at the Base level, providing the right level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
