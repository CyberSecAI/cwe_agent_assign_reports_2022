# Analysis for CVE-2021-39234

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 1.0 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | 0.75 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-863, which is a Class-level CWE. CWE-639 is a child of CWE-863 and represents a more specific type of authorization bypass. The vulnerability description supports the selection of CWE-863 as the primary weakness because the application performs an authorization check, but it is done incorrectly, allowing authenticated users to bypass ACLs and access blocks they should not have access to. CWE-639 is considered as a potential secondary weakness because the bypass is achieved through crafting a specific request with knowledge of an existing block ID, which can be viewed as a user-controlled key.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect authorization** check (CWE-863). An authenticated user exploits this **incorrect authorization** by crafting a specific request with knowledge of the ID of an existing block (CWE-639). This results in the bypass of ACLs and unauthorized access to raw block data.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-863 as the primary weakness, which aligns with the vulnerability description indicating that authorization checks are performed, but incorrectly. Further analysis considered CWE-639 because the vulnerability description states that the bypass is achieved by crafting specific requests with knowledge of a block ID. This can be considered as a user-controlled key. The decision to include both CWEs is based on the evidence that both the **incorrect authorization** and the **user-controlled key** contribute to the vulnerability. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-863 describes the general problem of **incorrect authorization**, while CWE-639 provides a more specific context of how the **authorization bypass** is achieved.

The vulnerability description states: "Authenticated users knowing the ID of an existing block can craft specific request allowing access those blocks, bypassing other security checks like ACL." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further clarifies: "**Root cause of vulnerability:** An authenticated user knowing the ID of an existing block can craft a specific request allowing access to those blocks. **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Bypassing of ACL and authorization checks." This evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-863 as the primary weakness and CWE-639 as a secondary weakness.

CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) were considered but not selected as the primary CWE. CWE-285 was not selected because the description explicitly states that authorization checks are performed, albeit incorrectly, while CWE-285 includes the case where authorization checks are not performed at all. CWE-862 was not selected for the same reason, as it focuses on the absence of authorization checks.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.



## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.



## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges 
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.



## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense
