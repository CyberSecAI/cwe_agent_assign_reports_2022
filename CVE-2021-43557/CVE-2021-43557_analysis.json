CWE-647 is a Variant of CWE-863, providing a more specific description of the authorization issue. The vulnerability description aligns well with the details of CWE-647, making it the more appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe647[\"CWE-647: Use of Non-Canonical URL Paths for Authorization Decisions\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe647 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe647 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper verification** of the `$request_uri` which leads to the ability to bypass the block list.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-647 as the primary candidate due to the **use of $request_uri without verification**, allowing bypass via non-canonical URL paths. The evidence for this is explicitly stated in the vulnerability description: \"The uri-block plugin in Apache APISIX before 2.10.2 **uses $request_uri without verification**. The $request_uri is the full original request URI without normalization. This makes it possible to construct a URI to bypass the block list on some occasions. For instance, when the block list contains ^/internal/, a URI like `//internal/` can be used to bypass it.\"\n\nThe retriever results also suggest CWE-647, indicating its relevance to the vulnerability description. While CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a potential candidate, CWE-647 provides a more specific explanation of the **authorization bypass** by focusing on the non-canonical URL paths.\n\nThe final selection is primarily based on the provided evidence and the hierarchical relationship between CWE-647 and CWE-863. CWE-647 is a variant of CWE-863, making it the more specific and appropriate choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
