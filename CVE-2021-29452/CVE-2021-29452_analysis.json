CWE-285 is a higher-level class that represents the general case of incorrect authorization, while CWE-863 is a more specific class that focuses on performing the authorization check incorrectly. Given that the vulnerability description specifically mentions that privileges were incorrectly checked, CWE-863 is a more appropriate and specific classification. The abstraction level influenced the selection, preferring the more specific \"Class\" of CWE-863 over the more general \"Class\" of CWE-285.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect privileges check** in the a12n-server application. This **incorrect privileges check** allows any logged-in user to edit other users' data through the HAL-Form feature, resulting in unauthorized modification of user data and potential account compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which highlight the **incorrect privileges check** as the root cause. The description states, \"Unfortunately, privileges were incorrectly checked allowing any logged in user to make this change.\" This directly supports the selection of CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization**.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by providing a hierarchical context. While CWE-285 **Improper Authorization** is a parent of CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization**, the evidence clearly indicates that the authorization check was performed incorrectly, making CWE-863 a more specific and accurate classification.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-863 directly addresses the **incorrect authorization** issue, providing a more granular classification than the more general CWE-285.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
