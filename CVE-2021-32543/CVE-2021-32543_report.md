## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-303 | Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-565 | Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-303, is a base-level CWE, and it is a child of CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication). This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-303 is a more specific instance of weak authentication. CWE-565 is related to vulnerabilities that arise from improper handling of cookies, which is relevant given the vulnerability's exploitation vector involving cookie manipulation.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect implementation** of the authentication algorithm (CWE-303). This leads to the ability to manipulate cookies, potentially due to a lack of validation and integrity checking (CWE-565). Finally, this culminates in unauthorized access to other accounts and the ability to perform actions with a spoofed identity.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment, supported by the vulnerability description and CVE details, points to a problem in the **implementation** of the authentication mechanism. The vulnerability description states that the "authentication management is **implemented incorrectly**". The manipulation of cookies is an attack vector, and the root cause is that the authentication algorithm itself is **incorrectly implemented**, which allows cookie manipulation to grant access.

The **Retriever Results** list CWE-303 as the top candidate, reinforcing this assessment. The sparse retriever gives this a score of 0.305. CWE-303 (Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm) aligns well with the root cause, and its base abstraction level is preferred.

CWE-565 is also considered, which is reliance on cookies without validation and integrity checking. This aligns with the cookie manipulation aspect of the attack.

The final selection is based on the evidence that the core issue is with the **incorrect implementation** of authentication, which is why CWE-303 is primary, with CWE-565 as secondary. These CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they address the root cause and the method of exploitation.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.82
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
