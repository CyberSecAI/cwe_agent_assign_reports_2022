This can lead to other issues such as CWE-190 **Integer Overflow or Wraparound**, which in turn can lead to CWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write**. The relationship between these CWEs is that truncation can cause unexpected values, leading to overflow and ultimately a write outside the intended buffer.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe197[\"CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\"]\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe197 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe190\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe197 primary\n    class cwe190,cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer truncation** (CWE-197), which can lead to an integer overflow (CWE-190). This overflow can then result in a heap-based buffer overflow, leading to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **integer truncation** as the primary root cause. The supporting evidence in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section clearly indicates \"**rootcause: integer truncation**.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" further solidifies this by stating, \"Integer truncation and subsequent integer overflow when calculating the buffer size...leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.\"\n\nThe relationship graph shows how CWE-197 can lead to CWE-190, which in turn can lead to CWE-787. This is a common vulnerability chain, where a truncation error causes an incorrect size calculation, leading to an overflow and ultimately an out-of-bounds write.\n\nCWE-197 is at the **Base** level of abstraction, which is the preferred level for mapping root causes, as indicated in the mapping guidance. CWE-190 and CWE-787 were chosen as secondary CWEs because they represent the subsequent steps in the vulnerability chain.\nThe selection of CWE-197 is based directly on the provided evidence and aligns with the recommended mapping practices. The confidence level is high due to the explicit mention of \"**integer truncation**\" as the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value.
