CWE-126 [CWE-126: Buffer Over-read] is a variant of CWE-125 [CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read], providing a slightly more specific classification if the read operation exceeds the buffer's boundaries. Given that the description mentions \"over-read\", CWE-126 [CWE-126: Buffer Over-read] is also considered. CWE-787 [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write] is included because an over-read might be a precursor to an out-of-bounds write, depending on the subsequent usage of the read data. All three have a child-parent relationship with CWE-119 [CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer].\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    cwe787 -->|PEEROF| cwe125\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe126,cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **heap-based buffer over-read**, represented by CWE-125 [CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read]. Depending on how the over-read data is used, it could potentially lead to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787 [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write]) or other exploitable conditions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions a \"**heap-based buffer over-read**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the root cause as \"Heap-based buffer overflow\". Based on this evidence, CWE-125 [CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read] is selected as the primary CWE because it accurately describes the **over-read** condition. CWE-126 [CWE-126: Buffer Over-read] and CWE-787 [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write] are considered as potential secondary CWEs, depending on the specifics of the vulnerability, but with lower confidence.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-125 [CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read] being a base CWE and CWE-126 [CWE-126: Buffer Over-read] being a variant. The retriever results support the selection of CWE-125 [CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read] and CWE-126 [CWE-126: Buffer Over-read] as relevant CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
