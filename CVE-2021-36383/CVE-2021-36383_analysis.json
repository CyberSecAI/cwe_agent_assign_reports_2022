It is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), representing a more specific form of authorization failure. CWE-472 (External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter) is related because the manipulated WebSocket data acts as an externally controlled parameter that the system assumes to be immutable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe472[\"CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe472 -->|ChildOf| cwe642\n    cwe472 -->|ChildOf| cwe471\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe472,cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **mishandling of authorization** by the application, where it **incorrectly** relies on client-provided data (WebSocket `resourceSet.getAll` data) to determine access rights. This leads to the attacker being able to **modify** the 'permission' field and escalate privileges, resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitial analysis identified CWE-863 as the primary weakness due to the **incorrect authorization** check. The application trusts the client-provided permission level, leading to privilege escalation. Supporting evidence includes the vulnerability description stating that the application \"**mishandles authorization**\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirming the \"**lack of proper authorization**\" and \"**insecure permission handling**\".\n\nCWE-472 is a secondary weakness because the vulnerability involves **external control** over a parameter (the 'permission' field in the WebSocket data) that the application assumes to be immutable. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports this by highlighting the manipulation of the API response.\n\nThe retriever results suggested several authorization-related CWEs, including CWE-284, CWE-285, CWE-862, and CWE-639. However, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was chosen as the primary CWE because the application does perform an authorization check, but it does so incorrectly by relying on the client-provided permission level.\n\nCWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) are higher-level classifications and less specific than CWE-863. CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) does not apply because the application attempts to authorize the request. CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) is related but not as precise as CWE-863, since the key in this case is the permission level itself, not just a generic key to access user data.\n\nCWE-472, while relevant, is a secondary concern, as the core issue is the **incorrect** authorization process. The abstraction level of CWE-863 (Class) is appropriate because there are no more specific Base or Variant level CWEs that accurately capture the **incorrect authorization** logic.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
