# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-32629

## Vulnerability Description
Cranelift is an open-source code generator maintained by Bytecode Alliance. It translates a target-independent intermediate representation into executable machine code. There is a bug in 0.73 of the Cranelift x64 backend that can create a scenario that could result in a potential sandbox escape in a Wasm program. This bug was introduced in the new backend on 2020-09-08 and first included in a release on 2020-09-30, but the new backend was not the default prior to 0.73. The recently-released version 0.73 with default settings, and prior versions with an explicit build flag to select the new backend, are vulnerable. The bug in question performs a sign-extend instead of a zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack, under a specific set of circumstances. If those circumstances occur, the bug could allow access to memory addresses upto 2GiB before the start of the Wasm program heap. If the heap bound is larger than 2GiB, then it would be possible to read memory from a computable range dependent on the size of the heaps bound. The impact of this bug is highly dependent on heap implementation, specifically * if the heap has bounds checks, and * does not rely exclusively on guard pages, and * the heap bound is 2GiB or smaller * then this bug cannot be used to reach memory from another Wasm program heap. The impact of the vulnerability is mitigated if there is no memory mapped in the range accessible using this bug, for example, if there is a 2 GiB guard region before the Wasm program heap. The bug in question performs a sign-extend instead of a zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack, when the register allocator reloads a spilled integer value narrower than 64 bits. This interacts poorly with another optimization the instruction selector elides a 32-to-64-bit zero-extend operator when we know that an instruction producing a 32-bit value actually zeros the upper 32 bits of its destination register. Hence, we rely on these zeroed bits, but the type of the value is still i32, and the spill/reload reconstitutes those bits as the sign extension of the i32s MSB. The issue would thus occur when * An i32 value in a Wasm program is greater than or equal to 0x8000_0000 * The value is spilled and reloaded by the register allocator due to high register pressure in the program between the values definition and its use * The value is produced by an instruction that we know to be special in that it zeroes the upper 32 bits of its destination add, sub, mul, and, or * The value is then zero-extended to 64 bits in the Wasm program * The resulting 64-bit value is used. Under these circumstances there is a potential sandbox escape when the i32 value is a pointer. The usual code emitted for heap accesses zero-extends the Wasm heap address, adds it to a 64-bit heap base, and accesses the resulting address. If the zero-extend becomes a sign-extend, the program could reach backward and access memory up to 2GiB before the start of its heap. In addition to assessing the nature of the code generation bug in Cranelift, we have also determined that under specific circumstances, both Lucet and Wasmtime using this version of Cranelift may be exploitable. See referenced GitHub Advisory for more details.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **sign-extend instead of zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack**
- **impact:** potential sandbox escape and read memory from a computable range
- **product:** Cranelift x64 backend
- **version:** 0.73

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32629:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect code generation in the Cranelift x64 backend, specifically during the spilling and reloading of integer values from the stack. When a 32-bit integer value is spilled and later reloaded, the code incorrectly performs a sign-extension instead of a zero-extension. This occurs when the register allocator spills the value due to high register pressure, and the value is produced by an instruction that is known to zero the upper 32-bits of the destination register. This is problematic because the compiler relies on the upper 32-bits of an i32 to be zero, and the incorrect sign extension can lead to an out-of-bounds memory access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Sign Extension:** The core vulnerability is the use of a sign-extension instead of a zero-extension when reloading a spilled 32-bit integer value from the stack.
*   **Optimization Reliance:** The instruction selector's optimization of eliding the 32-to-64-bit zero-extension, relying on the zeroed upper 32 bits from specific instructions, is also a contributing factor.
*   **Type Confusion:**  The type of the value is still i32 but reloaded as sign extended 64bit value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sandbox Escape:** A successful exploit could allow a WebAssembly module to access memory outside of its designated sandbox, potentially accessing up to 2GiB of memory before the start of its allocated heap. This out-of-bounds memory access could lead to arbitrary code execution by reading or writing to different parts of the memory.
*   **Control Flow Subversion:** In the context of a system like Fastly's Compute@Edge, this could be used to potentially subvert control flow in the daemon process.
*   **Memory Corruption/Crashes:**  If the memory accessed outside the sandbox is not valid for reading, the program would likely crash due to an out-of-bounds memory access, or assertion failure.
*   **Information Disclosure:** If attacker is able to craft a WASM module that bypasses the guard pages, they might be able to read memory from other sandboxes

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious WebAssembly Modules:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious WebAssembly module that triggers the specific conditions required for the vulnerability.
*   **Specific Conditions:** The attack requires:
    *   An i32 value greater than or equal to 0x8000_0000
    *   The value being spilled and reloaded due to register pressure.
    *   The value being produced by instructions that zero the upper 32 bits of the register.
    *   The value being used in a context where it's zero-extended to 64-bits (such as heap access).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Upload/Execute WebAssembly:**  The attacker needs the capability to upload and execute a specially crafted WebAssembly module, for example in a platform like Fastly's Compute@Edge or a vulnerable Wasmtime environment.
*   **Understanding of Cranelift Backend:**  The attacker needs knowledge of the Cranelift x64 backend, particularly how spilling and reloading works, and also the memory layout and heap structures of the environment the code is running in.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Cranelift versions up to 0.73.0. It was fixed in versions 0.73.1 and 0.74.0.
*   The impact is highly dependent on the environment, particularly how memory is allocated and managed for WebAssembly modules (e.g., the presence of guard pages).
*   Mitigation strategies include using memory allocators that employ Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and/or guard pages.
*   The issue was discovered through monitoring of unusual behaviour by WebAssembly modules.

This is a critical vulnerability that could lead to severe security issues if not addressed properly.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-194: Unexpected Sign Extension
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an operation on a number that causes it to be sign extended when it is transformed into a larger data type. When the original number is negative, this can produce unexpected values that lead to resultant weaknesses.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-681
ChildOf -> CWE-681
ChildOf -> CWE-681

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Sign extension errors can lead to buffer overflows and other memory-based problems. They are also likely to be factors in other weaknesses that are not based on memory operations, but rely on numeric calculation.

**[Maintenance]** This entry is closely associated with signed-to-unsigned conversion errors (CWE-195) and other numeric errors. These relationships need to be more closely examined within CWE.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2018-10887:** Chain: unexpected sign extension (CWE-194) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190), causing an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)
- **CVE-1999-0234:** Sign extension error produces -1 value that is treated as a command separator, enabling OS command injection.
- **CVE-2003-0161:** Product uses "char" type for input character. When char is implemented as a signed type, ASCII value 0xFF (255), a sign extension produces a -1 value that is treated as a program-specific separator value, effectively disabling a length check and leading to a buffer overflow. This is also a multiple interpretation error.




## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.




## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

### Extended Description

ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with "overflow," "underflow," and "wraparound" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called "underflows").


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.

**[Terminology]** 

"Integer overflow" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.


A "wraparound" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.


"Overflow" is sometimes conflated with "wraparound" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.


The "overflow" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use "overflow" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using "underflow" for exceeding the minimum.


Some people use "overflow" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses "underflow" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.


See [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.


**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.




## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read




## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().

### Extended Description

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Heap-based buffer overflows are usually just as dangerous as stack-based buffer overflows.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).




## CWE-1342: Information Exposure through Microarchitectural State after Transient Execution
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The processor does not properly clear microarchitectural state after incorrect microcode assists or speculative execution, resulting in transient execution.

### Extended Description


In many processor architectures an exception, mis-speculation, or microcode assist results in a flush operation to clear results that are no longer required. This action prevents these results from influencing architectural state that is intended to be visible from software. However, traces of this transient execution may remain in microarchitectural buffers, resulting in a change in microarchitectural state that can expose sensitive information to an attacker using side-channel analysis. For example, Load Value Injection (LVI) [REF-1202] can exploit direct injection of erroneous values into intermediate load and store buffers.


Several conditions may need to be fulfilled for a successful attack:


  1. incorrect transient execution that results in remanence of sensitive information;

  1. attacker has the ability to provoke microarchitectural exceptions;

  1. operations and structures in victim code that can be exploited must be identified.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** CWE-1342 differs from CWE-1303, which is related to misprediction and biasing microarchitectural components, while CWE-1342 addresses illegal data flows and retention. For example, Spectre is an instance of CWE-1303 biasing branch prediction to steer the transient execution indirectly.

**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.9, members of the CWE Hardware SIG are closely analyzing this entry and others to improve CWE's coverage of transient execution weaknesses, which include issues related to Spectre, Meltdown, and other attacks. Additional investigation may include other weaknesses related to microarchitectural state. As a result, this entry might change significantly in CWE 4.10.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-0551:** Load value injection in some processors utilizing speculative execution may allow an authenticated user to enable information disclosure via a side-channel with local access.




## CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer.

### Extended Description


While a pointer can contain a reference to any arbitrary memory location, a program typically only intends to use the pointer to access limited portions of memory, such as contiguous memory used to access an individual array.


Programs may use offsets in order to access fields or sub-elements stored within structured data. The offset might be out-of-range if it comes from an untrusted source, is the result of an incorrect calculation, or occurs because of another error.


If an attacker can control or influence the offset so that it points outside of the intended boundaries of the structure, then the attacker may be able to read or write to memory locations that are used elsewhere in the product. As a result, the attack might change the state of the product as accessed through program variables, cause a crash or instable behavior, and possibly lead to code execution.


### Alternative Terms
Untrusted pointer offset: This term is narrower than the concept of "out-of-range" offset, since the offset might be the result of a calculation or other error that does not depend on any externally-supplied values.

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.

**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2010-2160:** Invalid offset in undocumented opcode leads to memory corruption.
- **CVE-2010-1281:** Multimedia player uses untrusted value from a file when using file-pointer calculations.
- **CVE-2009-3129:** Spreadsheet program processes a record with an invalid size field, which is later used as an offset.




## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-2639:** Chain: integer coercion error (CWE-192) prevents a return value from indicating an error, leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)




## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.

### Extended Description
When a primitive is cast to a smaller primitive, the high order bits of the large value are lost in the conversion, potentially resulting in an unexpected value that is not equal to the original value. This value may be required as an index into a buffer, a loop iterator, or simply necessary state data. In any case, the value cannot be trusted and the system will be in an undefined state. While this method may be employed viably to isolate the low bits of a value, this usage is rare, and truncation usually implies that an implementation error has occurred.

### Additional Notes
**[Research Gap]** This weakness has traditionally been under-studied and under-reported, although vulnerabilities in popular software have been published in 2008 and 2009.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-17087:** Chain: integer truncation (CWE-197) causes small buffer allocation (CWE-131) leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in kernel pool, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.

- **CVE-2008-3282:** Size of a particular type changes for 64-bit platforms, leading to an integer truncation in document processor causes incorrect index to be generated.




## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.

### Alternative Terms
