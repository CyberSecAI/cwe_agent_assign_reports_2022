The vulnerability description strongly suggests CWE-1333 as the root cause due to the mention of \"**regex denial of service**\". While CWE-407 is a broader category, the specificity of the description points towards the more granular CWE-1333.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **inefficient regular expression**. This inefficiency leads to excessive CPU consumption when processing specific inputs, resulting in a **denial of service** by freezing the browser tab. The root cause is the poorly designed regex, and the impact is the denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-1333 as the primary candidate due to the **regex denial of service** (**ReDoS**) vulnerability explicitly mentioned in the description and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\". The Retriever Results also highlighted CWE-1333 as the top candidate.\n\nThe final assessment concludes that CWE-1333 is the most appropriate and specific CWE. The selection is based on the provided evidence, focusing on the **weakness:** **regex denial of service**, the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, and the retriever results.\n\nThe evidence from the Vulnerability Description: \"CKEditor 5 is an open source rich text editor framework with a modular architecture. The CKEditor 5 Markdown plugin (@ckeditor/ckeditor5-markdown-gfm) before version 25.0.0 has a **regex denial of service** (ReDoS) vulnerability.\"\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section provides further support: \"Root Cause of Vulnerability: A regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the CKEditor 5 Markdown plugin.\"\n\nThe relationship analysis shows that CWE-1333 is a child of CWE-407, indicating a specialized form of inefficient algorithmic complexity.\n\nThe final decision is to select CWE-1333 as the primary CWE, as it directly addresses the identified weakness, and CWE-407 as a secondary candidate because it is a broader category.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
