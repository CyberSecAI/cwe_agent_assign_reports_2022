CWE-313 (Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk) is a Variant of CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information). CWE-312 in turn is a child of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) and CWE-922 (Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information). CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a Class-level CWE with children including CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) and CWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format). The relationship analysis shows a clear path from the general issue of insecure credentials down to the specific case of storing them unencrypted in a file.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe313[\"CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe922[\"CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe257[\"CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\"]\n    \n    cwe313 -->|CHILDOF| cwe312\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe922\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe257 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe313 primary\n    class cwe312,cwe522 secondary\n    class cwe311,cwe922,cwe256,cwe257 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of encryption** (**missing encryption**) of the authentication credentials before they are saved. This leads directly to the **storage of these credentials in cleartext on the disk**, making them easily accessible to an attacker.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **storage of authentication credentials in cleartext** as the primary **weakness**. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section confirms this. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section highlights CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials). However, CWE-522 is a class-level CWE. The evidence clearly indicates that the credentials are not only insufficiently protected, but specifically stored in cleartext on disk. Thus, CWE-313 (Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk) is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. The \"Retriever Results\" also list CWE-313 as a candidate. CWE-312 is a valid secondary mapping because it represents the general case of sensitive information being stored in cleartext, but CWE-313 is more precise.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product **stores sensitive information in cleartext** within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product **does not encrypt sensitive** or critical **information** before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
