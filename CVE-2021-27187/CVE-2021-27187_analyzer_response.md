# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-313 | Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is the **storage of credentials in cleartext on disk**. CWE-313 (Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk) is a Variant of CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information). CWE-312 in turn is a child of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) and CWE-922 (Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information). CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a Class-level CWE with children including CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) and CWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format). The relationship analysis shows a clear path from the general issue of insecure credentials down to the specific case of storing them unencrypted in a file.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of encryption** (**missing encryption**) of the authentication credentials before they are saved. This leads directly to the **storage of these credentials in cleartext on the disk**, making them easily accessible to an attacker.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified the **storage of authentication credentials in cleartext** as the primary **weakness**. The "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" section confirms this. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section highlights CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials). However, CWE-522 is a class-level CWE. The evidence clearly indicates that the credentials are not only insufficiently protected, but specifically stored in cleartext on disk. Thus, CWE-313 (Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk) is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. The "Retriever Results" also list CWE-313 as a candidate. CWE-312 is a valid secondary mapping because it represents the general case of sensitive information being stored in cleartext, but CWE-313 is more precise.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product **stores sensitive information in cleartext** within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product **does not encrypt sensitive** or critical **information** before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

## CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product **stores sensitive information without properly limiting read or write access** by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users. In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders. If a system administrator can recover a password directly, or use a brute force search on the available information, the administrator can use the password on other accounts.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-316: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product **stores sensitive information in cleartext in memory**.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product **transmits sensitive** or security-critical data **in cleartext** in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
