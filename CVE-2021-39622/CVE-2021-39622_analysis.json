It is a Class-level CWE. A more specific CWE, such as CWE-926 (**CWE-926: Improper Export of Android Application Components**) could also be considered.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe926[\"CWE-926: Improper Export of Android Application Components\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe926 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe926 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a **missing permission check** (CWE-862) leading to a bypass of Factory Reset Protection. The root cause is the **missing permission check**, and the impact is bypassing Factory Reset Protection, which enables local escalation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates a **missing permission check** in GBoard that allows bypassing Factory Reset Protection. The root cause is the **missing permission check**, which directly relates to authorization.\n\nCWE-862 (**CWE-862: Missing Authorization**) is a Class-level CWE describing a situation where a product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. This aligns well with the **missing permission check** described in the vulnerability. The impact, bypassing Factory Reset Protection and achieving local escalation of privilege, is a direct consequence of this missing authorization. The CWE's description accurately captures the essence of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-926 (**CWE-926: Improper Export of Android Application Components**) is a Variant-level CWE. It describes a situation where an Android application exports a component for use by other applications, but does not properly restrict which applications can launch the component or access the data it contains. While the vulnerability description does not explicitly mention improper export of components, the possibility exists that the missing permission check is related to an exported component.\n\nThe evidence from the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases states \"**rootcause:** **missing permission check**\".\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states that \"The provided document indicates that CVE-2021-39622 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability\".\n\nBased on the evidence, CWE-862 is the most appropriate primary CWE due to the explicit mention of a **missing permission check**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
