The secondary CWEs considered are CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) and CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials). CWE-532 is a child of CWE-200 (Information Exposure). CWE-256 is a child of CWE-522, which in turn is related to CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere). CWE-532 and CWE-256 are at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred, while CWE-522 is a Class, suggesting that a more specific child might be appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe256,cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **storage of unencrypted credentials**. This leads to sensitive information being present in the audit logs. An attacker with authenticated access can then view this sensitive information in clear text, potentially gaining access to network devices.\n\nRoot Cause: **Storage of unencrypted credentials**\nWeakness: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File (CWE-532)\nImpact: Exposure of Sensitive Information\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identifies the **storage of unencrypted credentials** in audit logs as the root cause. The primary CWE selected is CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) because the vulnerability description explicitly states that the issue is due to the storage of certain unencrypted credentials in the audit logs, which directly aligns with the CWE's description. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" further supports this by stating \"The vulnerability is due to the **storage of certain unencrypted credentials** in the audit logs\".\n\nCWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) was considered because the stored credentials are unencrypted. However, since the credentials are not necessarily passwords and are stored in a log file, CWE-532 is a more precise fit. CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a more general class of weakness and less descriptive than CWE-532.\n\nThe graph relationships highlight that CWE-532 is a child of CWE-200 (Information Exposure), which accurately reflects the impact of the vulnerability. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly describe the root cause and the resulting exposure of sensitive information in log files.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence that the vulnerability involves storing unencrypted credentials in audit logs, making CWE-532 the most accurate and specific classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
