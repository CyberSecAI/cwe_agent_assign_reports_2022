Its children include CWE-1390 Weak Authentication and CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function. CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials is also a child of CWE-287, representing how the credentials are being protected. The relationships show a progression from a general authentication failure to specific weaknesses in credential protection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Insecure Authentication:** The root cause is the **authentication mechanism** failing to properly validate the origin of the token.\n2.  **Netrc Exposure:** This leads to the `~/.netrc` file being accessible.\n3.  **Secret Exposure:** The attacker can then obtain secrets from the `~/.netrc` file.\n4.  **Unauthorized API Access:** Finally, the attacker uses the stolen credentials to access the Vela API.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **insecure authentication mechanism** that led to the vulnerability. The evidence clearly points to a failure in validating the token's origin. The graph relationships highlight the connection between the general authentication failure (CWE-287) and the specific weakness in protecting credentials (CWE-522). The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-287 capturing the core authentication flaw and CWE-522 detailing how the credentials were inadequately protected.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that an **authentication mechanism** added in version 0.7.0 enables a malicious user to obtain secrets. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the server did not properly check if a provided token was created by Vela before using it to authorize a user. This constitutes **insecure authentication**. This allowed an attacker to use a valid GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) to gain unauthorized access to the Vela API. The attacker must first gain administrative access to the Vela server, then create a malicious pipeline designed to output the contents of `~/.netrc` into the build logs, extract the token from the build logs, and finally use the compromised token to interact with any API endpoint accessible by the compromised user.\n\nCWE-287 Improper Authentication is a Class-level CWE that describes a situation where the product does not sufficiently prove that a claimed identity is correct. Given the root cause description, this is the most appropriate CWE. While CWE-287 is discouraged, it's because lower-level CWEs may be more applicable. In this case, the \"Insecure Authentication\" weakness in the CVE details aligns well with CWE-287.\n\nCWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials is a Class-level CWE that describes a situation where the product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval. In this case, the GitHub credentials were stored in the `~/.netrc` file, which was accessible within the build environment and allowed for secret exposure.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function as a potential candidate. However, this CWE is more appropriate when there is a complete lack of authentication, rather than an improper implementation.\n\nThe descriptions for other CWEs such as CWE-212, CWE-74, CWE-319, CWE-668, CWE-639, CWE-807, CWE-226, CWE-23, CWE-345, CWE-1336, CWE-863, CWE-88, CWE-918, CWE-22, CWE-178, CWE-79, CWE-209, CWE-611, CWE-1289, CWE-202, CWE-917, CWE-1336, and CWE-94 do not fit the vulnerability description as closely as CWE-287 and CWE-522.",
