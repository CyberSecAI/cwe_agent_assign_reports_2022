Its child CWE, CWE-1240 (Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation), is a Base-level CWE and represents a more specific instance of using risky cryptographic algorithms. CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength) is also a Class-level CWE and is related to the strength of encryption, but less specific than algorithms. The relationships indicate a hierarchy from general cryptographic issues to specific algorithm implementation risks, helping to refine the selection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n\n    cwe1240 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe326 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    cwe327 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe1240,cwe326 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the use of **weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms** (CWE-327), which leads to the potential to **decrypt highly sensitive information**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the provided vulnerability description, highlighting the use of **weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms** in IBM QRadar SIEM. The evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" clearly points to a cryptographic issue. The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" also lists CWE-327 as the primary match.\n\nThe analysis considered several CWEs, particularly CWE-327, CWE-326, and CWE-1240. The final decision emphasizes CWE-327 as the primary weakness because it directly addresses the use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm. CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength) was considered, but CWE-327 is more specific to the algorithm itself being risky. CWE-1240 (Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation) is more specific but still relevant as a secondary concern.\n\nThe selection of CWE-327 is based on the following evidence:\n- The vulnerability description states \"**weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms**\".\n- The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" identifies \"**weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms**\" as the root cause.\n- The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" mentions \"Use of weak cryptographic algorithms.\"\n- \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" identifies CWE-327 as the primary CWE match.\n\nThe usage guidance for CWE-327 is \"Allowed-with-Review,\" suggesting a check for more specific children. While CWE-1240 is a child, the description indicates a non-standard implementation, which isn't explicitly stated in the vulnerability. Therefore, CWE-327 is the most appropriate primary mapping.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
