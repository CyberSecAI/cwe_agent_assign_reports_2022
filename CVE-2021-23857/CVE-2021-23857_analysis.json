CWE-836 is a child of CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication), indicating that it is a specific type of weak authentication. CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) is a child of CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) and CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash), suggesting related but distinct weaknesses. The selection is influenced by favoring the more specific CWE-836, which directly describes the **root cause**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe836[\"CWE-836: Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n\n    cwe836 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe328\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe836 primary\n    class cwe916 secondary\n    class cwe1390,cwe327,cwe328 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **root cause**, which is the use of password hashes instead of passwords for authentication (CWE-836). This is compounded by CVE-2021-23858, which exposes the password hashes. The chain then leads to the impact, which is an attacker gaining unauthorized access to the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **root cause** described in the vulnerability description: \"login routine allows the client to log in to the system not by using the password, but by using the hash of the password.\" This directly aligns with CWE-836 (Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication). The retriever results also highlighted CWE-836 as the top candidate. The graph relationships show that CWE-836 is a specific type of weak authentication (CWE-1390). The decision to select CWE-836 is based on the clear evidence from the vulnerability description and the support from the retriever results. The evidence supporting CWE-836 is, \"The login routine allows authentication using the password hash instead of the actual password.\" I considered CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) as a secondary candidate because the strength of the password hash is a related concern. However, the primary issue is the use of the hash instead of the password itself.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
