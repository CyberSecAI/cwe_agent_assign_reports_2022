This indicates that CWE-862 is a more specific type of access control issue. The selection between CWE-862 and CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) was influenced by their peer relationship, where CWE-668 is a broader class of resource exposure. However, given the specific nature of the **permissions bypass** described, CWE-862 is deemed a better fit, even though it is a Class-level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe862 --o|PEEROF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe668 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **permissions bypass** in `change_pte_range` which leads to making a shared mmap writable.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the description of the vulnerability pointed towards a **permissions bypass** which would indicate an authorization issue. The evidence in \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section states \"**weakness:** **permissions bypass**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section describes the intention to use `mprotect` to protect memory regions, and the vulnerability allows shared memory mappings to be writable.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). This is due to the explicit mention of a **permissions bypass**, indicating that authorization checks are either missing or insufficient.\n\nCWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) was considered but deemed less suitable as the primary CWE. Although the vulnerability results in a resource (shared mmap) being exposed to the wrong sphere (writable when it should not be), the root cause is more accurately described as a failure to properly authorize access, hence the stronger focus on authorization issues.\n\nCWE-667 (Improper Locking), CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')), CWE-413 (Improper Resource Locking), CWE-665 (Improper Initialization), CWE-1260 (Improper Handling of Overlap Between Protected Memory Ranges), CWE-364 (Signal Handler Race Condition), CWE-1021 (Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames), CWE-514 (Covert Channel), CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) were considered based on the Retriever Results, but they were not selected as they did not directly address the **permissions bypass** aspect of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-862 directly relates to the authorization aspect of the vulnerability. While it is a Class-level CWE, it accurately reflects the core issue of missing or insufficient authorization checks.",
