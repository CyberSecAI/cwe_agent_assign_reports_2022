# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-476 | NULL Pointer Dereference | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The code attempts to dereference a null pointer when the tensor_name list is empty.|
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The code attempts to read data past the end of the intended buffer when the restore_index is out of bounds. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The vulnerability exhibits two distinct weaknesses: a **NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)** and an **Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)**. Both of these are child-of **CWE-119**, which is **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**, indicating that both vulnerabilities stem from issues with memory boundary handling. The **NULL Pointer Dereference** occurs when there is no tensor list, while the **Out-of-bounds Read** happens when the index is outside of the tensor list bounds. These are independent issues triggered by different conditions.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain involves the following:
1.  The user provides a crafted `tensor_name` list and `preferred_shard` value to `tf.raw_ops.Restore` or `tf.raw_ops.RestoreSlice`.
2.  If the `tensor_name` list is empty, a **NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)** occurs.
3.  If the `restore_index` (derived from `preferred_shard`) is out of bounds, an **Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)** occurs.
4.  The **NULL Pointer Dereference** leads to a denial-of-service (DoS).
5.  The **Out-of-bounds Read** potentially leads to information disclosure.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the detailed vulnerability description and the CVE reference link content summary, which provides evidence of both a **NULL Pointer Dereference** and an **Out-of-bounds Read** vulnerability. The retriever results also strongly support these CWEs.

The primary weakness is the **NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)**, which occurs when the code attempts to dereference a null pointer because the `tensor_name` list is empty. This directly leads to a crash and a denial-of-service. The second issue is the **Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)**, which occurs when the `restore_index` is outside the bounds of the allocated heap data. This can lead to sensitive information being disclosed.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately describe the specific weaknesses present in the vulnerability.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-37639

## Vulnerability Description
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. When restoring tensors via raw APIs, if the tensor name is not provided, TensorFlow can be tricked into dereferencing a null pointer. Alternatively, attackers can read memory outside the bounds of heap allocated data by providing some tensor names but not enough for a successful restoration. The [implementation](https//github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/47a06f40411a69c99f381495f490536972152ac0/tensorflow/core/kernels/save_restore_tensor.cc#L158-L159) retrieves the tensor list corresponding to the `tensor_name` user controlled input and immediately retrieves the tensor at the restoration index (controlled via `preferred_shard` argument). This occurs without validating that the provided list has enough values. If the list is empty this results in dereferencing a null pointer (undefined behavior). If, however, the list has some elements, if the restoration index is outside the bounds this results in heap OOB read. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9e82dce6e6bd1f36a57e08fa85af213e2b2f2622. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **dereferencing a null pointer, heap out-of-bounds read**
- **impact:** read memory outside the bounds of heap allocated data
- **product:** TensorFlow
- **component:** raw APIs

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37639:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `tf.raw_ops.Restore` and `tf.raw_ops.RestoreSlice` operations within TensorFlow. Specifically, the code fails to properly validate the length of the `tensor_name` list against the `preferred_shard` index before accessing elements, leading to potential issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Null Pointer Dereference:** If an empty `tensor_name` list is provided, the code attempts to access a tensor at a given `restore_index` which results in accessing a null pointer, causing a crash.
2.  **Heap Out-of-Bounds Read:** If `tensor_name` list has elements, but the `restore_index` (derived from user-provided `preferred_shard`) is greater or equal to the length of the `tensor_name` list, then the code will attempt to read memory out of bounds of the allocated heap data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A null pointer dereference can lead to a crash, causing a denial of service.
*   **Information Disclosure:** An out-of-bounds read can potentially expose sensitive information from the heap memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by calling the `tf.raw_ops.Restore` or `tf.raw_ops.RestoreSlice` with a crafted `tensor_name` list and `preferred_shard`.
*   Specifically, an empty `tensor_name` list will trigger the null pointer dereference, while a `tensor_name` list with a length smaller than `preferred_shard` will trigger a heap out of bounds read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `tf.raw_ops.Restore` or `tf.raw_ops.RestoreSlice` operations, specifically the `tensor_name` argument and the `preferred_shard` argument.
*   The attacker needs to be able to execute TensorFlow code.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided commit [9e82dce6e6bd1f36a57e08fa85af213e2b2f2622](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/9e82dce6e6bd1f36a57e08fa85af213e2b2f2622) fixes this issue by adding a check to ensure that the `restore_index` is within the bounds of the `tensor_name` list.
* The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity.
* The affected versions are TensorFlow versions prior to 2.6.0, and the patches have been backported to versions 2.3.4, 2.4.3, and 2.5.1.
* The vulnerability was reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.

ChildOf -> CWE-754
ChildOf -> CWE-754

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-3274:** race condition causes a table to be corrupted if a timer activates while it is being modified, leading to resultant NULL dereference; also involves locking.
- **CVE-2002-1912:** large number of packets leads to NULL dereference
- **CVE-2005-0772:** packet with invalid error status value triggers NULL dereference




## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

### Extended Description


If the pointer contains an uninitialized value, then the value might not point to a valid memory location. This could cause the product to read from or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial of service. If the uninitialized pointer is used as a function call, then arbitrary functions could be invoked. If an attacker can influence the portion of uninitialized memory that is contained in the pointer, this weakness could be leveraged to execute code or perform other attacks.


Depending on memory layout, associated memory management behaviors, and product operation, the attacker might be able to influence the contents of the uninitialized pointer, thus gaining more fine-grained control of the memory location to be accessed.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.

**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-32878:** LLM product has a free of an uninitialized pointer
- **CVE-2010-0211:** chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) leads to free of invalid, uninitialized pointer (CWE-824).
- **CVE-2009-2768:** Pointer in structure is not initialized, leading to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) and system crash.




## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Heap-based buffer overflows are usually just as dangerous as stack-based buffer overflows.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).




## CWE-415: Double Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.

### Extended Description
When a program calls free() twice with the same argument, the program's memory management data structures become corrupted. This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer. If malloc() returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.

### Alternative Terms
Double-free

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is usually resultant from another weakness, such as an unhandled error or race condition between threads. It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.

**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of "Use after Free", but "Use" and "Release" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately "Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release", which doesn't exist yet.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).
- **CVE-2004-0642:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.
- **CVE-2004-0772:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.




## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

### Extended Description

- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms

## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

### Extended Description


While assertion is good for catching logic errors and reducing the chances of reaching more serious vulnerability conditions, it can still lead to a denial of service.


For example, if a server handles multiple simultaneous connections, and an assert() occurs in one single connection that causes all other connections to be dropped, this is a reachable assertion that leads to a denial of service.
