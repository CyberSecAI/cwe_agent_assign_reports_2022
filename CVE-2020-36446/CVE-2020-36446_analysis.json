The vulnerability allows non-`Send` types to be moved between threads, potentially leading to data races. |\n| CWE-667 | Improper Locking | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability could lead to the unlocking of mutexes from a thread that did not lock them. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-362, which is a Class-level CWE. The vulnerability description directly mentions the potential for data races due to the **incorrect** implementation of `Send` and `Sync` traits. CWE-362's description fits this scenario because it involves concurrent execution and improper synchronization.\nCWE-667 is related as a potential consequence of the race condition, where mutexes can be unlocked by the wrong thread.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    \n    cwe362 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe667\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe667 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with the **incorrect** implementation of `Send` and `Sync` for `SyncChannel`. This allows non-`Send` types to be moved between threads, leading to a race condition (CWE-362). The race condition can then lead to data races, memory corruption, and incorrect mutex unlocking.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe assessment is primarily based on the provided evidence, particularly the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which explicitly mentions data races and incorrect thread safety implementation.\n\nThe key evidence is: \"The `SyncChannel` type in the `signal-simple` crate **incorrectly** implemented `Send` and `Sync` traits unconditionally, without requiring the contained type `T` to also implement `Send`. This allows non-`Send` types to be moved between threads,\" and \"Users can create undefined behavior (UB) in safe Rust code by sending types that are not safe to share between threads (i.e., `!Send` types). This can lead to data races, memory corruption, and the unlocking of mutexes from a thread that did not lock them.\"\n\nThe graph relationships support the selection of CWE-362 as the primary weakness, with CWE-667 as a secondary weakness arising from the race condition.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-362 being a Class-level CWE and CWE-667 also a Class-level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not selected* because the core issue isn't about resource release, but about improper synchronization leading to data races.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Selected as a secondary CWE* because the vulnerability description mentions that the issue can lead to the unlocking of mutexes from a thread that did not lock them.\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not selected* because the vulnerability does not primarily revolve around resource consumption or amplification.\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not selected* because the vulnerability is not related to inefficient algorithms.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
