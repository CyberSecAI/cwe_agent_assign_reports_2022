This can lead to code execution. **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine CWE-1336** is a child of **CWE-94** and relates to the specific use of template engines. The **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') CWE-22** indicates an issue with path restrictions, where external input isn't properly neutralized, potentially allowing access to files outside the restricted directory.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe1336 -->|ChildOf| cwe94\n    cwe94 -->|ChildOf| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe1336,cwe22 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain begins with the **improper handling of the translator service** within the expression language, leading to **unrestricted access to methods** and the potential for **file inclusion**. This file inclusion can then result in **remote code execution**. The root cause is the **lack of proper neutralization** when constructing code segments.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" and \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" sections, which provide sufficient evidence for CWE mapping.\n\nThe vulnerability description mentions a **PHP file include** vulnerability. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states that the `SymfonyExpressionTokenProvider` directly exposed the translator service to the expression language, allowing methods like `addResource` to be called. This can include files from the local file system, leading to remote code execution.\n\n**CWE-94** aligns well with this, as it describes the product constructing a code segment using externally-influenced input without proper neutralization. The advisory indicates that the translator object was passed directly to the expression language, allowing access to dangerous methods. This aligns with the description of **CWE-94**. While **CWE-94** is \"Allowed-with-Review\", the conditions of the vulnerability align strongly with the CWE description.\n\n**CWE-1336** is also considered, as it describes vulnerabilities related to template engines. The expression language in Symfony can be viewed as a type of template engine. The vulnerability stems from the **improper neutralization** of special elements used within this expression language.\n\n**CWE-22** is also considered because of the arbitrary file read impact. The `addResource` function in the translator can be used to include a file from the local file system.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the base level of specificity, providing a clear representation of the weaknesses involved.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
