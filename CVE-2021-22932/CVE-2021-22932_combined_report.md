*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-311 and CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure). This indicates that the missing encryption is a specific type of protection mechanism failure. The "Mapping Guidance" for CWE-311 advises that it is a Class level CWE and that more specific children should be considered. However, given the specific context, a more specific CWE is not needed.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the execution of the CTX269106 mitigation tool, which leads to the **disabling of the ShareFile file encryption option**. This **missing encryption** (CWE-311) exposes sensitive data.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description, which clearly states that the mitigation tool **disables the ShareFile file encryption option**.

The vulnerability description states "An issue has been identified in the CTX269106 mitigation tool for Citrix ShareFile storage zones controller which causes the ShareFile file encryption option to become disabled if it had previously been enabled." This clearly indicates a **lack of encryption** for sensitive data, directly corresponding to CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data.

The selection of CWE-311 is at an appropriate level of specificity. While more specific child CWEs exist, they describe particular encryption contexts (storage, transmission) that aren't explicitly detailed in the report.

Relevant CWE Information:

### CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
This CWE was considered, but the vulnerability does not involve writing sensitive information to a file or directory. It involves disabling encryption, which is different.

### CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
This is a potential child of CWE-311. However, the vulnerability description does not explicitly state that the files are being stored in cleartext, only that the encryption option is disabled.

### CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
This CWE does not fit because the issue is not about failing to remove sensitive information, but about disabling encryption.

### CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
Similar to CWE-312, this could be a child of CWE-311, but there is no explicit mention of cleartext transmission.

### CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
This CWE is related to data authenticity, which is not the core issue here. The problem is the disabling of encryption.

### CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
This CWE is about differences in behavior revealing information, which is not the case here.

### CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
This CWE is too broad and does not accurately capture the specific issue of disabling encryption.

### CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
This CWE is about reusing resources without clearing sensitive information, which is not relevant to this vulnerability.

### CWE-778: Insufficient Logging
Logging is not relevant to this vulnerability.

### CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
This CWE is about using weak encryption algorithms, but the issue here is that encryption is disabled entirely.

### CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
This CWE is about race conditions, which are not related to the vulnerability.

### CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
Authentication is not the primary issue. The problem is the **disabling of encryption**.

### CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
Authorization is not the primary issue. The problem is the **disabling of encryption**.

### CWE-322: Key Exchange without Entity Authentication
Key exchange is not relevant to the vulnerability.

### CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
Input validation is not relevant to the vulnerability.

### CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity
Case sensitivity is not relevant to the vulnerability.

### CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
Certificate validation is not relevant to the vulnerability.

### CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
Return values are not relevant to the vulnerability.

### CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name
Authentication bypass is not relevant to the vulnerability.

### CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
Sending sensitive data is not explicitly part of this vulnerability.

### CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
Timing discrepancies are not relevant to this vulnerability.

### CWE-1272: Sensitive Information Uncleared Before Debug/Power State Transition
This is not about a power state transition or debugging.

### CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
This is not about restricting communication channels.

The "Retriever Results" suggested CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) as the top candidate. This aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description.

Given the evidence and analysis, CWE-311 is the most appropriate classification.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

### Extended Description
The lack of proper data encryption passes up the guarantees of confidentiality, integrity, and accountability that properly implemented encryption conveys.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-693

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider children CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information or CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** There is an overlapping relationship between insecure storage of sensitive information (CWE-922) and missing encryption of sensitive information (CWE-311). Encryption is often used to prevent an attacker from reading the sensitive data. However, encryption does not prevent the attacker from erasing or overwriting the data.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie
- **CVE-2009-1466:** password stored in cleartext in a file with insecure permissions
- **CVE-2009-0152:** chat program disables SSL in some circumstances even when the user says to use SSL.




## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

### Extended Description


Attackers might be able to spoof the intended endpoint from a different system or process, thus gaining the same level of access as the intended endpoint.


While this issue frequently involves authentication between network-based clients and servers, other types of communication channels and endpoints can have this weakness.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30319:** S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which can be bypassed by a forged IP address.
- **CVE-2022-22547:** A troubleshooting tool exposes a web server on a random port between 9000-65535 that could be used for information gathering
- **CVE-2022-4390:** A WAN interface on a router has firewall restrictions enabled for IPv4, but it does not for IPv6, which is enabled by default




## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

### Extended Description
Capture-replay attacks are common and can be difficult to defeat without cryptography. They are a subset of network injection attacks that rely on observing previously-sent valid commands, then changing them slightly if necessary and resending the same commands to the server.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1390
ChildOf -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-3435:** product authentication succeeds if user-provided MD5 hash matches the hash in its database; this can be subjected to replay attacks.
- **CVE-2007-4961:** Chain: cleartext transmission of the MD5 hash of password (CWE-319) enables attacks against a server that is susceptible to replay (CWE-294).




## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).




## CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext in a file, or on disk.

### Extended Description
The sensitive information could be read by attackers with access to the file, or with physical or administrator access to the raw disk. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-312

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Different people use "cleartext" and "plaintext" to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-1481:** Cleartext credentials in world-readable file.
- **CVE-2005-1828:** Password in cleartext in config file.
- **CVE-2005-2209:** Password in cleartext in config file.




## CWE-322: Key Exchange without Entity Authentication
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product performs a key exchange with an actor without verifying the identity of that actor.

### Extended Description
Performing a key exchange will preserve the integrity of the information sent between two entities, but this will not guarantee that the entities are who they claim they are. This may enable an attacker to impersonate an actor by modifying traffic between the two entities. Typically, this involves a victim client that contacts a malicious server that is impersonating a trusted server. If the client skips authentication or ignores an authentication failure, the malicious server may request authentication information from the user. The malicious server can then use this authentication information to log in to the trusted server using the victim's credentials, sniff traffic between the victim and trusted server, etc.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-306
CanPrecede -> CWE-923
PeerOf -> CWE-295

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use






## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30273:** SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity
- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.
- **CVE-2008-3775:** Product uses "ROT-25" to obfuscate the password in the registry.




## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

### Extended Description
This weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.

### Alternative Terms
TOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to "Time Of Check To Time Of Use".
TOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.

### Relationships

ChildOf -> CWE-362

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.

**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed
- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.
- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.




## CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product writes sensitive information to a log file.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-538
ChildOf -> CWE-200

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2017-9615:** verbose logging stores admin credentials in a world-readable log file
- **CVE-2018-1999036:** SSH password for private key stored in build log
