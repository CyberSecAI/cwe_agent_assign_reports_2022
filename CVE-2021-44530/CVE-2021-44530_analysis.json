CWE-74 is a Class level CWE, making CWE-917 more specific. CWE-917 is also a peer of CWE-1336.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe917[\"CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n\n    cwe917 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe917 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe917 --|PEEROF| cwe1336\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe917 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe77,cwe1336 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a third-party library containing an **injection vulnerability**. This allows a malicious actor to control the application. The root cause is the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an expression language statement.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description states an **injection vulnerability** exists in a third-party library that allows a malicious actor to control the application. The key phrase is \"**injection vulnerability**\".\n\nBased on the retriever results, the top CWE candidates are:\n*   CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n*   CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n\nCWE-917 is a Base level CWE with a description that the product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement using externally-influenced input but does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed. The observed examples include **CVE-2021-44228**: Product does not neutralize ${xyz} style expressions, allowing remote code execution. (log4shell vulnerability in log4j). Given the description states Log4J CVE-2021-44228, this maps well and is chosen as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-74 is a Class level CWE that the product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component. Since it is a Class level CWE, it is less specific than CWE-917.\n\nCWE-79, CWE-78, CWE-1336, CWE-20, CWE-94, CWE-502, CWE-306 and CWE-200 were considered, but deemed less relevant. CWE-79 is for Cross-site Scripting, CWE-78 is for OS Command Injection, CWE-1336 is for Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine, CWE-20 is for Improper Input Validation, CWE-94 is for Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'), CWE-502 is Deserialization of Untrusted Data, CWE-306 is Missing Authentication for Critical Function and CWE-200 is Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor. None of these mapped as well as CWE-917.\n\nThe assessment is heavily based on the provided evidence, especially the mention of \"Log4J CVE-2021-44228\".\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## Vulnerability Description\nAn **injection vulnerability** exists in a third-party library used in UniFi Network Version 6.5.53 and earlier (Log4J CVE-2021-44228) allows a malicious actor to control the application.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **weakness:** **injection vulnerability**\n- **impact:** control the application\n- **attacker:** malicious actor\n- **product:** UniFi Network\n- **version:** 6.5.53 and earlier\n- **component:** third-party library",
