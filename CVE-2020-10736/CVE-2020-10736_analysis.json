The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check. |\n| CWE-639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. Authorization bypass by modifying the key value identifying the data. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization, which is a child of both CWE-285 Improper Authorization and CWE-284 Improper Access Control. CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key is also a child of CWE-863 and CWE-284. The relationships indicate a hierarchy from general access control issues (CWE-284) to more specific authorization flaws (CWE-863, CWE-285) and an even more specific case of authorization bypass (CWE-639). Selecting CWE-863 provides a balance between generality and specificity, accurately reflecting the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper restriction of access**, leading to an **authorization bypass**. This allows an authenticated client to **modify the configuration** and potentially conduct further attacks.\nThe chain: **Improper Access Control** -> **Incorrect Authorization** -> **Configuration Modification/Further Attacks**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed towards authorization bypass due to the **root cause** being \"**do not properly restrict access**\". The detailed CVE description and root cause analysis confirm that the `ceph-mon` and `ceph-mgr` daemons **do not properly restrict access**, leading to an **authorization bypass**. The authenticated client can then modify the configuration and conduct further attacks.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization, because the authorization check is performed but is not correctly performed.\n\nCWE-284 Improper Access Control is too general, as it encompasses broader access control issues beyond just authorization.\n\nCWE-285 Improper Authorization is also a strong candidate because the product does not perform the authorization check correctly. However, given that an authorization check *is* performed, but incorrectly, CWE-863 is a slightly better fit.\n\nCWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key is more specific and applies if the bypass occurs through modifying a key value. In this case, the bypass isn't explicitly stated as being through a user-controlled key, thus CWE-863 is a better fit.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is based on the evidence from the CVE description, particularly the sections describing how `ceph-mon` and `ceph-mgr` daemons fail to properly validate permissions and access control.\n\nThe provided evidence and the relationship analysis support the selection of CWE-863 as the primary CWE. The abstraction level is appropriate as it is a Class-level CWE, offering a good balance between generality and specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
