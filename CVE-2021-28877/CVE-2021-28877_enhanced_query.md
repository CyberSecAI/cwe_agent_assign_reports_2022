# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-28877

## Vulnerability Description
In the standard library in Rust before 1.51.0, the Zip **implementation calls __iterator_get_unchecked() for the same index more than once when nested**. This bug can lead to a memory safety violation due to an unmet safety requirement for the TrustedRandomAccess trait.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **implementation calls __iterator_get_unchecked() for the same index more than once when nested**
- **impact:** memory safety violation
- **product:** Rust standard library
- **version:** before 1.51.0
- **component:** Zip implementation

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28877:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from an incorrect composition of the `TrustedRandomAccess` specialization in nested `iter::Zip` adapters. When a `Zip` adapter is partially consumed and then wrapped in another `Zip` adapter, the outer adapter may return elements that should have already been consumed. This is because the `TrustedRandomAccess` optimization does not correctly track offsets after partial consumption in nested `Zip` iterators.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect `TrustedRandomAccess` specialization:** The `TrustedRandomAccess` trait is not correctly implemented for nested `Zip` iterators, leading to incorrect offset calculations after partial consumption of the inner iterator.
- **Potential for logic errors:**  The incorrect offset calculation can lead to iterators returning the wrong elements or returning elements multiple times, causing unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The immediate impact of this vulnerability is incorrect iterator behavior, potentially leading to:

*   **Incorrect data processing:** When nested `Zip` iterators are used, and one of them is partially consumed, it might result in incorrect data being returned by the outer iterator.
*   **Possible performance issues:** The initial report also suggests potential performance impacts, if the optimizer is tripped up by the addition.
*   **Logic errors:** The unexpected behavior can cause logic errors that can be difficult to debug.

**Attack Vectors:**

The primary attack vector involves using nested `Zip` iterators where the inner iterator is partially consumed before being used in the outer `Zip`.  This is a logical bug rather than a traditional attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

An attacker would need to control or influence the logic using `Zip` iterators in Rust code, and specifically trigger the situation where a partially consumed `Zip` adapter is nested within another. No specific privileges or network access are required for exploitation, as this is a flaw within the logic of the Rust standard library implementation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Rust for years before being discovered.
*   The fix was implemented by correcting the `TrustedRandomAccess` specialization.
*   The fix was included in the Rust 1.51.0 release.
*   The provided GitHub pull request ([#80670](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80670)) contains details about the vulnerability and its fix.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-118
ChildOf -> CWE-20

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

### Extended Description
This weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.

### Alternative Terms
TOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to "Time Of Check To Time Of Use".
TOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-362
ChildOf -> CWE-362

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.

## CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product dereferences a pointer that contains a location for memory that was previously valid, but is no longer valid.

### Extended Description
When a product releases memory, but it maintains a pointer to that memory, then the memory might be re-allocated at a later time. If the original pointer is accessed to read or write data, then this could cause the product to read or modify data that is in use by a different function or process. Depending on how the newly-allocated memory is used, this could lead to a denial of service, information exposure, or code execution.

### Alternative Terms
Dangling pointer

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.

**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2008-5013:** access of expired memory address leads to arbitrary code execution
- **CVE-2010-3257:** stale pointer issue leads to denial of service and possibly other consequences
- **CVE-2008-0062:** Chain: a message having an unknown message type may cause a reference to uninitialized memory resulting in a null pointer dereference (CWE-476) or dangling pointer (CWE-825), possibly crashing the system or causing heap corruption.
