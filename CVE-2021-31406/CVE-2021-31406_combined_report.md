## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-208, "Observable Timing Discrepancy," which accurately captures the essence of the vulnerability: a **non-constant-time comparison** leads to observable timing differences that an attacker can exploit.

CWE-1254, "Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity," is considered a related CWE because the **non-constant-time comparison** is happening at a finer granularity where the timing differences can be observed. CWE-1254 is a child of CWE-208, indicating a more specific type of timing discrepancy related to comparison logic.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **non-constant-time comparison of CSRF tokens**, which is the root cause. This leads to an **observable timing discrepancy (CWE-208)**. An attacker exploits this discrepancy via a **timing attack**, eventually being able to **guess the security token**. This allows the attacker to potentially submit data on behalf of the user or manipulate websockets.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis correctly identifies the vulnerability as a timing attack stemming from **non-constant-time comparison of CSRF tokens**. The retriever results strongly suggest CWE-208 (Observable Timing Discrepancy) as a potential match, which aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description.

The provided evidence is strong, as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **"Non-constant-time comparison of CSRF tokens"** and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary describes it as a "Timing Side Channel" which allows attackers to infer information about the token's validity through timing analysis.

The relationship analysis indicates that CWE-208 is the more general case, while CWE-1254 (Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity) is a more specific variant. Given that the vulnerability description highlights the comparison of CSRF tokens as the source of the timing discrepancy, CWE-1254 is a strong secondary candidate.

The final decision is to classify the vulnerability primarily as CWE-208, with CWE-1254 as a secondary candidate. CWE-208 directly captures the essence of the vulnerability, while CWE-1254 provides additional context regarding the comparison logic. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-31406

## Vulnerability Description
**Non-constant-time comparison of CSRF tokens** in endpoint request handler in com.vaadinflow-server versions 3.0.0 through 5.0.3 (Vaadin 15.0.0 through 18.0.6), and com.vaadinfusion-endpoint version 6.0.0 (Vaadin 19.0.0) allows attacker to guess a security token for Fusion endpoints via timing attack.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Non-constant-time comparison of CSRF tokens**
- **impact:** guess a security token for Fusion endpoints
- **vector:** timing attack
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** com.vaadinflow-server and com.vaadinfusion-endpoint
- **version:** 3.0.0 through 5.0.3 and 6.0.0
- **component:** endpoint request handler

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the non-constant-time comparison of CSRF tokens in the endpoint request handler of Vaadin. This means the time taken to reject a request with an invalid token varied, allowing attackers to infer information about the token's validity through timing analysis. Specifically, the previous fix was incomplete, neglecting CSRF token checking in Fusion endpoints.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Timing Side Channel:** The primary vulnerability is a timing side channel (CWE-208). By observing the time it takes for the server to respond to requests with different CSRF tokens, an attacker can deduce the correct token through multiple attempts.
- **Incomplete Fix:** An earlier attempt to fix similar issues was incomplete, leaving CSRF token checking in Fusion endpoints vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **CSRF Token Exposure:** A successful timing attack could expose the user's CSRF token.
- **Blind Data Submission:** The attacker can use the exposed token to submit data on the user's behalf. However, they cannot directly read back responses.
- **Websocket Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially open websockets and receive published data from the server for the compromised user. This data may or may not contain sensitive information depending on the application's nature.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack is performed by sending crafted HTTP requests with varying tokens.
- **Timing Analysis:** The attacker needs to analyze the server's response time to determine if a token is correct, based on minute differences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Vaadin application.
- **Timing Observation:** The attacker must be capable of accurately measuring the response time of the server.
- **Iterative Attacks:** The exploit requires sending multiple requests with varying tokens to perform a timing analysis.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects `com.vaadin:flow-server` versions 3.0.0 through 5.0.3 (Vaadin 15.0.0 through 18.0.6), and `com.vaadin:fusion-endpoint` version 6.0.0 (Vaadin 19.0.0).
- The fix implemented a constant-time comparison for all security tokens, mitigating timing attacks.
- The provided text also references a related vulnerability and fix, indicating that similar issues were previously discovered.
- The fix was implemented in pull request #10157, which is also referenced.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

### Extended Description
In security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Often primary in cryptographic applications and algorithms.

**[Maintenance]** CWE 4.16 removed a demonstrative example for a hardware module because it was inaccurate and unable to be adapted. The CWE team is developing an alternative.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies
- **CVE-2019-10482:** Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels
- **CVE-2014-0984:** Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.




## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
According to WASC, "Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization."

### Extended Description

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.






## CWE-1254: Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product's comparison logic is performed over a series of steps rather than across the entire string in one operation. If there is a comparison logic failure on one of these steps, the operation may be vulnerable to a timing attack that can result in the interception of the process for nefarious purposes.

### Extended Description


Comparison logic is used to compare a variety of objects including passwords, Message Authentication Codes (MACs), and responses to verification challenges. When comparison logic is implemented at a finer granularity (e.g., byte-by-byte comparison) and breaks in the case of a comparison failure, an attacker can exploit this implementation to identify when exactly the failure occurred. With multiple attempts, the attacker may be able to guesses the correct password/response to challenge and elevate their privileges.

## CWE-1295: Debug Messages Revealing Unnecessary Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product fails to adequately prevent the revealing of unnecessary and potentially sensitive system information within debugging messages.

### Extended Description


Debug messages are messages that help troubleshoot an issue by revealing the internal state of the system. For example, debug data in design can be exposed through internal memory array dumps or boot logs through interfaces like UART via TAP commands, scan chain, etc. Thus, the more information contained in a debug message, the easier it is to debug. However, there is also the risk of revealing information that could help an attacker either decipher a vulnerability, and/or gain a better understanding of the system. Thus, this extra information could lower the "security by obscurity" factor. While "security by obscurity" alone is insufficient, it can help as a part of "Defense-in-depth".

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses




## CWE-1255: Comparison Logic is Vulnerable to Power Side-Channel Attacks
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A device's real time power consumption may be monitored during security token evaluation and the information gleaned may be used to determine the value of the reference token.

### Extended Description


The power consumed by a device may be instrumented and monitored in real time. If the algorithm for evaluating security tokens is not sufficiently robust, the power consumption may vary by token entry comparison against the reference value. Further, if retries are unlimited, the power difference between a "good" entry and a "bad" entry may be observed and used to determine whether each entry itself is correct thereby allowing unauthorized parties to calculate the reference value.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-12788:** CMAC verification vulnerable to timing and power attacks.




## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

### Extended Description


When resources are released, they can be made available for reuse. For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.


Even when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.


This weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-459
ChildOf -> CWE-212
CanPrecede -> CWE-201

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).

**[Maintenance]** This entry needs modification to clarify the differences with CWE-212. The description also combines two problems that are distinct from the CWE research perspective: the inadvertent transfer of information to another sphere, and improper initialization/shutdown. Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.

**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release
- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.
- **CVE-2003-0291:** router does not clear information from DHCP packets that have been previously used




## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.

### Extended Description
Some regular expression engines have a feature called "backtracking". If the token cannot match, the engine "backtracks" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.
 Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:


  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.

  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.

  - The input can be long enough.

 Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. 

### Alternative Terms
ReDoS: ReDoS is an abbreviation of "Regular expression Denial of Service".
Regular Expression Denial of Service: While this term is attack-focused, this is commonly used to describe the weakness.
Catastrophic backtracking: This term is used to describe the behavior of the regular expression as a negative technical impact.

**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-5243:** server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.
- **CVE-2021-21317:** npm package for user-agent parser prone to ReDoS due to overlapping capture groups
- **CVE-2019-16215:** Markdown parser uses inefficient regex when processing a message, allowing users to cause CPU consumption and delay preventing processing of other messages.




## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

### Extended Description


Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.


For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.


One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.


### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-36539:** An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.




## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

### Extended Description


Resources such as files and directories may be inadvertently exposed through mechanisms such as insecure permissions, or when a program accidentally operates on the wrong object. For example, a program may intend that private files can only be provided to a specific user. This effectively defines a control sphere that is intended to prevent attackers from accessing these private files. If the file permissions are insecure, then parties other than the user will be able to access those files.


A separate control sphere might effectively require that the user can only access the private files, but not any other files on the system. If the program does not ensure that the user is only requesting private files, then the user might be able to access other files on the system.


In either case, the end result is that a resource has been exposed to the wrong party.

**Rationale:** CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** A "control sphere" is a set of resources and behaviors that are accessible to a single actor, or a group of actors. A product's security model will typically define multiple spheres, possibly implicitly. For example, a server might define one sphere for "administrators" who can create new user accounts with subdirectories under /home/server/, and a second sphere might cover the set of users who can create or delete files within their own subdirectories. A third sphere might be "users who are authenticated to the operating system on which the product is installed." Each sphere has different sets of actors and allowable behaviors.
