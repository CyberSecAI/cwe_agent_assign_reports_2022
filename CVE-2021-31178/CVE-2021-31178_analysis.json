CWE-200 and CWE-497 are related to information exposure, with CWE-497 being a child of CWE-200. The hierarchical structure suggests that if more details were available, CWE-497 might be a more specific fit than the broader CWE-200.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cweNVD[\"CWE-NVD-noinfo: NVD Provided No Information For This Vulnerability\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cweNVD primary\n    class cwe200,cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe provided information is insufficient to determine a vulnerability chain. The description only mentions **Information Disclosure** as the impact. Without knowing the root cause, it's impossible to map a sequence of weaknesses.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment relies heavily on the limited information provided. The primary mapping, CWE-NVD-noinfo, directly reflects the absence of detailed vulnerability information from the NVD. The secondary CWEs, CWE-200 and CWE-497, were considered based on the **impact** of **Information Disclosure**, but they remain speculative due to the lack of root cause details.\n\nThe graph relationships show how a lack of information leads to a very high-level classification. If more information were available, a more specific CWE (like CWE-497) would be preferred.\n\nThe selection of CWE-NVD-noinfo is justified by the explicit statement that the NVD provided no information. The choice of CWE-200 and CWE-497, while less certain, attempts to capture the essence of the **Information Disclosure** impact, albeit at a higher, less specific level of abstraction.\nThe assessment is based on the evidence only, and that evidence is extremely limited:\n\"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:\n- **impact:** Information Disclosure\n- **product:** Microsoft Office\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
