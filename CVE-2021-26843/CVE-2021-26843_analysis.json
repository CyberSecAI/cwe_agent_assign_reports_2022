It is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-119 (**Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**). CWE-125 (**Out-of-bounds Read**) is considered as a secondary CWE because while the primary issue is writing out of bounds, reading out of bounds could be related to this vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper use of `strcpy`** when implemented with `memcpy`, leading to overlapping memory ranges and a subsequent **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787). This results in **memory corruption** and a **Denial-of-Service** (daemon crash).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly points to CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**) as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary highlight the issue of `strcpy` being implemented with `memcpy` causing overlapping memory ranges and leading to memory corruption. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-787.\n\nThe choice of CWE-787 is further supported by the following evidence:\n\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** \"strcpy function implemented with memcpy\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"The vulnerability stems from the use of `strcpy` within the `de_dotdot` function of `libhttpd.c` in `sthttpd`. Specifically, when `strcpy` is implemented using `memcpy` (as is the case on GLIBC and macOS), it can lead to memory corruption or a crash due to overlapping memory ranges being passed to `memcpy`.\"\n\nCWE-125 (**Out-of-bounds Read**) was considered because memory corruption could potentially lead to reading data from unintended memory locations.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-191 was considered but deemed less relevant because the core issue is not related to integer underflow but rather memory corruption due to overlapping memory operations.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-131 was not selected because the vulnerability is not caused by an incorrect buffer size calculation, but rather by the use of `strcpy` with potentially overlapping memory regions when implemented with `memcpy`.\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-126 was considered as a secondary candidate because the primary impact is writing to an out-of-bounds memory location, but it is possible that this could lead to out-of-bounds reads as well.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-125 was considered as a secondary candidate.
