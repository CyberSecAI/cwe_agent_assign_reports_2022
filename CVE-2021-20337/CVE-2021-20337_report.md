## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-327 | Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm | 1.0 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |
| CWE-326 | Inadequate Encryption Strength | 0.8 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the selection was the parent-child relationship between CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure) and both CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) and CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength). Since the vulnerability explicitly mentions the use of **weak cryptographic algorithms**, selecting a CWE related to cryptographic issues is appropriate. The Retriever Results indicated both CWE-327 and CWE-326 as potential candidates.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of weaknesses starts with the **root cause** of the **use of weak cryptographic algorithms**, leading to the impact of potential decryption of sensitive information by an attacker.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-327 as the primary candidate due to the vulnerability description explicitly stating the use of **weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms**. This aligns with the CWE's description of using a "broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol." CWE-326 was considered as a secondary candidate.

The evidence supporting this decision comes directly from the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" which identified "**weak cryptographic algorithms**" as the **rootcause**. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" further reinforces this by stating, "The IBM QRadar SIEM is using weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms."

The relationship analysis, particularly the parent-child relationship with CWE-693, confirmed that a cryptographic weakness is the correct classification.

The final decision to select CWE-327 is based on the explicit mention of **weak cryptographic algorithms** and is at the appropriate level of specificity (Class) as recommended by the MITRE mapping guidance, which states, "This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate." Further analysis to identify a more specific base-level CWE could be beneficial, but currently the evidence supports CWE-327.
