CWE-184 is included as a secondary CWE because the root cause is **improper input sanitization**, which can mean that the list of disallowed inputs is incomplete.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe184\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe184 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input sanitization**, leading to **command injection** and ultimately resulting in arbitrary code execution. The **lack of proper sanitization** allows attackers to inject malicious commands into the PowerShell command, leading to code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-78 as the primary weakness due to the **command injection** vulnerability. The supporting evidence lies in the vulnerability description stating that the RetroArch text-to-speech engine passes unsanitized input to PowerShell, enabling attackers to execute code via **command injection**. The CVE reference link summary further confirms this, specifying that the `accessibility_speak_windows` function in `platform_win32.c` does not sanitize input, which leads to **command injection**. The **root cause** is **improper input sanitization**.\n\nThe analysis also considered CWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs) as a potential secondary weakness. The connection is that the **improper input sanitization** might stem from an incomplete list of disallowed inputs. This is a reasonable assumption given the nature of the vulnerability.\n\nThe final decision is to include CWE-78 as the primary weakness, with CWE-184 as a secondary contributing factor. This aligns with the evidence provided and the relationships between the CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant

Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')**\n\n    *   The product constructs an OS command using externally-influenced input but does not neutralize special elements.\n    *   This allows attackers to modify the intended OS command, leading to arbitrary code execution.\n    *   The vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the RetroArch user.\n    *   This is a Base level CWE, providing a specific classification of the weakness.\n    *   Mapping Guidance: Allowed.\n*   **CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs**\n\n    *   The product implements a protection mechanism using a list of disallowed inputs, but the list is incomplete.\n    *   This incompleteness allows attackers to bypass the protection mechanism.\n    *   This is a Base level CWE.\n    *   Mapping Guidance: Allowed.\n\n### Rejected CWEs\n\n*   **CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')**: While related, CWE-78 is more specific as it involves OS commands.\n*   **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**: Not applicable as the vulnerability is not related to path traversal.\n*   **CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element**: Not applicable as the vulnerability is not related to uncontrolled search paths.\n*   **CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')**: While code execution is the impact, the vulnerability is not due to improper generation of code but rather the injection of commands.\n*   **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**: Too generic; CWE-78 and CWE-184 provide more specific classifications.\n\nThe choice of CWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the OS command injection vulnerability.",
