CWE-287 is a high-level class, while CWE-1390 is a more specific class. Since the description indicates an **Authentication Bypass**, and CWE-1390 falls under that category, it's a relevant consideration. However, CWE-305 (Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness) offers a more specific base-level classification, suggesting the bypass stems from another weakness. The relationships and abstraction levels guided the selection towards a combination of CWE-287 as a general classification, with consideration of CWE-1390 and CWE-305 for greater specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe305[\"CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\"]\n    \n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe305 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe1390,cwe305 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an unspecified **weakness** in the SAML Authentication component, leading to an **Authentication Bypass**, and culminating in unauthorized access to the application in the context of targeted user accounts. The chain is:\n1.  Unspecified **weakness** in SAML Authentication Component\n2.  CWE-287 Improper Authentication / CWE-1390 Weak Authentication / CWE-305 Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\n3.  Impact: Gain access to the application in the context of the targeted users account.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the primary focus was on identifying the most appropriate CWE for the **Authentication Bypass** vulnerability. The retriever results pointed to CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication), and CWE-305 (Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness).\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description highlights an **Authentication Bypass** in the SAML Authentication component.\n*   \"An **Authentication Bypass** vulnerability in the SAML Authentication component of BlackBerry Workspaces Server (deployed with Appliance-X) version(s) 10.1, 9.1 and earlier could allow an attacker to potentially gain access to the application in the context of the targeted users account.\"\n\nBased on the MITRE mapping guidance, CWE-287 is discouraged due to its high-level classification, suggesting the consideration of more specific child CWEs. CWE-1390 is a more specific child, focusing on **weak authentication** mechanisms, making it a strong candidate. CWE-305 is also a strong candidate because it more directly addresses the **Authentication Bypass** issue.\n\nThe final decision involves using CWE-287 as the primary CWE due to its alignment with the general **Improper Authentication** issue, while acknowledging the relevance of CWE-1390 and CWE-305 in further specifying the nature of the **weakness** that leads to the **bypass**. The selection of CWE-287 is at the optimal level of specificity given the available evidence, even though it is discouraged.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n\n## CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs authentication based on the name of a resource being accessed, or the name of the actor performing the access, but it does not properly check all possible names for that resource or actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n\n## CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed as the result of a separate weakness that is primary to the authentication error.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n\n## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n\n**Description**:\nThis attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5324.49\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n\n## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 5192.16\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 5045.57\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 4904.92\n\n**Description**:\nWhen an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 4900.35\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak",
