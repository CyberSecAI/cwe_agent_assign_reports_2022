CWE-126 is more specific because it explicitly involves reading past the end of the buffer. CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is related as a potential consequence of out-of-bounds reads, especially when heap memory is involved. The relationship between these CWEs helps to refine the classification from a general out-of-bounds read to a more precise buffer over-read.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    cwe126 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe122\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe126 primary\n    class cwe125,cwe122 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **heap-based buffer over-read** (**WEAKNESS**), leading to a denial-of-service (**IMPACT**) due to a crafted file (**VECTOR**). The chain here is direct: the over-read is the root cause, and the denial of service is the immediate impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed towards CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), driven by the \"heap-based buffer over-read\" description. However, after reviewing the definitions and relationships, CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) was selected as the primary CWE because it more precisely captures the nature of the vulnerability, which involves reading *past* the end of the buffer. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the **heap-based buffer over-read** occurs in `vc1_decode_b_mb_intfi in vc1_block.c`.\n\nCWE-126 is a variant of CWE-125, providing a more specific classification. The \"Retriever Results\" also list CWE-126 with a high score, supporting this choice.\n\n*   **CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read):** This is the primary CWE because the vulnerability description specifically mentions a \"heap-based buffer over-read.\" CWE-126 directly addresses the scenario where a program reads past the end of an allocated buffer. The description of CWE-126, \"The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer,\" aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description.\n\n*   **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read):** This is considered as a secondary CWE since CWE-126 is a child of CWE-125 and provides a more precise description of the vulnerability.\n\n*   **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow):** While the vulnerability is heap-based, the primary issue is an over-read, not an overflow. An overflow involves writing data beyond the buffer's boundaries, whereas this vulnerability involves reading beyond the boundaries. Therefore, CWE-122 is less appropriate but relevant due to the heap context.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-126 being a variant that accurately describes the vulnerability, and CWE-125 providing a broader context.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
