CWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-287. The vulnerability description indicates a **flaw in the social login implementation**, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to login as any user. This suggests that the authentication process is either missing or implemented incorrectly. Since CWE-287 is discouraged and suggests using CWE-306, both are considered.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **flaw in the social login implementation**, leading to **improper authentication**, and finally allowing an **unauthenticated attacker to login as any user on the site**.\n- **Root Cause:** Flaw in Social Login implementation.\n- **Weakness:** Improper or Missing Authentication (CWE-287 or CWE-306).\n- **Impact:** Unauthenticated user can login as any user.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered CWE-287 and CWE-306 based on the description indicating a **flaw in the social login implementation** that allowed unauthenticated users to login as any user.\n\nThe evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" clearly states that the **root cause** is a **flaw in the social login implementation**, and the impact is an **authentication bypass**. The description mentions an **unauthenticated attacker** being able to **login as any user**, which points to a problem with authentication.\n\nThe relationship analysis shows that CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287, providing a more specific classification when authentication is completely missing. The retriever results also support these CWEs with high scores, especially CWE-287.\n\nThe mapping guidance for CWE-287 discourages its direct use, suggesting to consider its children like CWE-306. While the initial assessment was CWE-287, the evidence suggests that the authentication is not completely missing, but rather **flawed**, leading to bypass. However, since the attacker is unauthenticated, CWE-306 is considered as a secondary candidate to show that the authentication is missing for an attacker.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-287 as a general classification and CWE-306 as a more specific one, providing a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is related to injection vulnerabilities.
