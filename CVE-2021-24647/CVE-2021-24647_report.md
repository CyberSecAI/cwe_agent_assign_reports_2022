## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 1.0 | Class | Primary | Discouraged |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.9 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-287, Improper Authentication, which is a Class-level CWE. CWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-287. The vulnerability description indicates a **flaw in the social login implementation**, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to login as any user. This suggests that the authentication process is either missing or implemented incorrectly. Since CWE-287 is discouraged and suggests using CWE-306, both are considered.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **flaw in the social login implementation**, leading to **improper authentication**, and finally allowing an **unauthenticated attacker to login as any user on the site**.
- **Root Cause:** Flaw in Social Login implementation.
- **Weakness:** Improper or Missing Authentication (CWE-287 or CWE-306).
- **Impact:** Unauthenticated user can login as any user.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment considered CWE-287 and CWE-306 based on the description indicating a **flaw in the social login implementation** that allowed unauthenticated users to login as any user.

The evidence from the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" and "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" clearly states that the **root cause** is a **flaw in the social login implementation**, and the impact is an **authentication bypass**. The description mentions an **unauthenticated attacker** being able to **login as any user**, which points to a problem with authentication.

The relationship analysis shows that CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287, providing a more specific classification when authentication is completely missing. The retriever results also support these CWEs with high scores, especially CWE-287.

The mapping guidance for CWE-287 discourages its direct use, suggesting to consider its children like CWE-306. While the initial assessment was CWE-287, the evidence suggests that the authentication is not completely missing, but rather **flawed**, leading to bypass. However, since the attacker is unauthenticated, CWE-306 is considered as a secondary candidate to show that the authentication is missing for an attacker.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-287 as a general classification and CWE-306 as a more specific one, providing a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

*Not Selected:* This is related to injection vulnerabilities. There is no mention of injection in the vulnerability description.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This is related to tampering with hidden form fields or parameters, but the vulnerability description does not provide enough information to support this.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This CWE is potentially relevant, but there isn't enough information to confirm it is happening.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This is about authorization bypass. The vulnerability is focused on authentication bypass

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* There's no evidence of input validation problems.

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* The vulnerability description does not provide sufficient information to determine if the authentication algorithm was implemented incorrectly.

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* The vulnerability description specifies that an unauthenticated user can log in, indicating a missing authentication rather than weak authentication.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This is about authorization bypass, not authentication.

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This is not about information exposure.
