# Analysis for CVE-2021-39772

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1.0 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-285 | Improper Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review, Parent of CWE-862 |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization). This means CWE-862 is a more specific case of CWE-285. The evidence directly supports the "missing permission check," which falls squarely under the definition of missing authorization. Therefore, while CWE-285 is a valid higher-level classification, CWE-862 provides a more precise characterization of the vulnerability. The other relationships like chains or peer relationships are not as directly relevant to this specific vulnerability description.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is straightforward:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing permission check** (CWE-862)
2.  **Impact:** Access to a2dp audio control switch, leading to local escalation of privilege.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis, based on the vulnerability description and key phrases, clearly points to a **missing permission check** as the root cause. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that this is an Elevation of Privilege (EoP) issue.

The Retriever Results list CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as the top candidate, which aligns perfectly with the **missing permission check** mentioned in the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases.

The decision to select CWE-862 is strongly supported by the evidence:
*   The vulnerability description explicitly states a **"missing permission check."**
*   CWE-862 directly addresses the scenario where a product "does not perform an authorization check."
*   The impact (access to a2dp audio control switch, local escalation of privilege) is a typical consequence of missing authorization.

The selection of CWE-862 as the primary CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the **root cause** described in the vulnerability. While CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is a parent CWE and could be considered, CWE-862 provides a more precise characterization of the weakness.

- **CVE-2008-2934:** Free of an uninitialized pointer leads to crash and possible code execution.




## CWE-927: Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The Android application uses an implicit intent for transmitting sensitive data to other applications.

### Extended Description


Since an implicit intent does not specify a particular application to receive the data, any application can process the intent by using an Intent Filter for that intent. This can allow untrusted applications to obtain sensitive data. There are two variations on the standard broadcast intent, ordered and sticky.


Ordered broadcast intents are delivered to a series of registered receivers in order of priority as declared by the Receivers. A malicious receiver can give itself a high priority and cause a denial of service by stopping the broadcast from propagating further down the chain. There is also the possibility of malicious data modification, as a receiver may also alter the data within the Intent before passing it on to the next receiver. The downstream components have no way of asserting that the data has not been altered earlier in the chain.


Sticky broadcast intents remain accessible after the initial broadcast. An old sticky intent will be broadcast again to any new receivers that register for it in the future, greatly increasing the chances of information exposure over time. Also, sticky broadcasts cannot be protected by permissions that may apply to other kinds of intents.


In addition, any broadcast intent may include a URI that references data that the receiving component does not normally have the privileges to access. The sender of the intent can include special privileges that grant the receiver read or write access to the specific URI included in the intent. A malicious receiver that intercepts this intent will also gain those privileges and be able to read or write the resource at the specified URI.

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

### Extended Description


A race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.


A race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:


  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.

  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.

A race condition exists when an "interfering code sequence" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.

The interfering code sequence could be "trusted" or "untrusted." A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.


### Alternative Terms
Race Condition

ChildOf -> CWE-691
CanPrecede -> CWE-416
CanPrecede -> CWE-476

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.

**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.

**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.

**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-925: Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The Android application uses a Broadcast Receiver that receives an Intent but does not properly verify that the Intent came from an authorized source.

### Extended Description
Certain types of Intents, identified by action string, can only be broadcast by the operating system itself, not by third-party applications. However, when an application registers to receive these implicit system intents, it is also registered to receive any explicit intents. While a malicious application cannot send an implicit system intent, it can send an explicit intent to the target application, which may assume that any received intent is a valid implicit system intent and not an explicit intent from another application. This may lead to unintended behavior.

- **CVE-2002-1912:** large number of packets leads to NULL dereference
- **CVE-2005-0772:** packet with invalid error status value triggers NULL dereference




## CWE-223: Omission of Security-relevant Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not record or display information that would be important for identifying the source or nature of an attack, or determining if an action is safe.

### Extended Description

- **CVE-2000-0542:** Failed authentication attempts are not recorded if later attempt succeeds.




## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

### Extended Description


Locking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.

**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice
- **CVE-2010-4210:** function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.




## CWE-514: Covert Channel
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
A covert channel is a path that can be used to transfer information in a way not intended by the system's designers.

### Extended Description
Typically the system has not given authorization for the transmission and has no knowledge of its occurrence.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1229

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** A covert channel can be thought of as an emergent resource, meaning that it was not an originally intended resource, however it exists due the application's behaviors.

**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.9, members of the CWE Hardware SIG are working to improve CWE's coverage of transient execution weaknesses, which include issues related to Spectre, Meltdown, and other attacks that create or exploit covert channels. As a result of that work, this entry might change in CWE 4.10.
