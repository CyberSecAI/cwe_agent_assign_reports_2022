CWE-113 is a variant of CWE-93, specifically dealing with HTTP headers. The vulnerability involves **CRLF injection** into SMTP headers, so both CWEs are relevant, but CWE-93 is a more general root cause. The relationship shows that CWE-113 is a more specific case of CWE-93.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    \n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe93 primary\n    class cwe113 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with a **user-controlled parameter not being correctly validated**. This leads to the ability to **inject CRLF characters and arbitrary SMTP headers** into the generated test email. The final impact is the potential for malicious use, such as email spoofing or other SMTP-based attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-93 as the primary candidate due to the **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences**. The vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary both emphasize the ability to inject CRLF characters into the SMTP headers.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-93 is strong, as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the ability to \"add the Carriage Return and Line Feed (CRLF) control characters and include arbitrary SMTP headers.\" The CVE reference links content summary confirms that the root cause is the **improper validation** of the \"subject\" parameter, allowing for **CRLF injection**.\n\nThe retriever results also support this assessment, with CWE-93 being the top-ranked CWE. The relationship graph shows that CWE-113 is a child of CWE-93, indicating a more specific context within HTTP headers.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-93 as the primary CWE is based on the core weakness of **improper CRLF neutralization**, while CWE-113 is considered a secondary candidate due to its specific focus on HTTP headers, which is a relevant but not the central aspect of the vulnerability.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-93 being a base-level CWE and CWE-113 being a variant. This provides a balance between generality and precision in the classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product acts as an intermediary HTTP agent\n         (such as a proxy or firewall) in the data flow between two\n         entities such as a client and server, but it does not\n         interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that\n         are consistent with how the messages will be processed by\n         those entities that are at the ultimate destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping

Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-150: Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream

dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external
