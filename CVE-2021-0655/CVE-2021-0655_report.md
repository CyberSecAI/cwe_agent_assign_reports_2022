# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-0655

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.7 | Class | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-787, which is a Base level CWE and a child of CWE-119. CWE-119 is a Class level CWE and represents a more general case of the vulnerability. The analysis focuses on the specific **incorrect bounds check** leading to **memory corruption**, making CWE-787 the most appropriate choice.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain involves an **incorrect bounds check** leading to a **memory corruption**, specifically an out-of-bounds write.
  - **Root Cause:** Incorrect bounds check
  - **Weakness:** Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)
  - **Impact:** Local escalation of privilege

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and key phrases, points towards CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as the primary CWE. The description explicitly mentions an **incorrect bounds check** which leads to a **memory corruption**, aligning perfectly with the characteristics of CWE-787. The "CWE for similar CVE Descriptions" section also lists CWE-787 as the primary match and top CWE.

The Retriever Results also list CWE-787 as the top result. The evidence provided supports this classification, as it directly states the root cause and resulting weakness.

The hierarchical relationships, specifically the ChildOf relationship between CWE-787 and CWE-119, were considered. While CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a parent of CWE-787, the more specific nature of an "out-of-bounds write" makes CWE-787 a more accurate representation of the vulnerability.

The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately captures the root cause (incorrect bounds check) and the resulting weakness (out-of-bounds write).

CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size), CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource), CWE-667 (Improper Locking), CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')), CWE-1260 (Improper Handling of Overlap Between Protected Memory Ranges), CWE-130 (Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency), CWE-704 (Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast), CWE-191 (Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)), and CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) were considered but not selected. These CWEs, while potentially related to memory corruption or improper resource handling, do not directly address the specific issue of an **incorrect bounds check** leading to an out-of-bounds write.
