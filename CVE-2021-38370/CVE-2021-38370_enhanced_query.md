### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **product:** Alpine
- **version:** before 2.25

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-38370:

**Verification:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2021-38370, which is mentioned in the Gentoo bug report, the Gentoo Security Advisory, and the NO STARTTLS paper, specifically detailing a vulnerability in the Alpine email client.

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the Alpine email client improperly handling untagged responses from an IMAP server before the STARTTLS handshake is complete. This means the client processes commands from the server when it shouldn't, before a secure connection is established.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Acceptance of untagged responses before STARTTLS: The client processes server messages before the TLS connection is established, which is vulnerable to manipulation.
    *   Denial of service: The related issue mentioned is a crash of the Alpine client when LIST or LSUB commands are sent before STARTTLS.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Leakage/Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious IMAP commands by sending crafted responses to the client before STARTTLS is initiated. This can lead to modification of mail content or other malicious activity.
    *   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could send specific commands (LIST, LSUB) before the secure connection is established, causing the Alpine client to crash.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker positioned between the email client and server can intercept and modify network traffic. The attacker can manipulate server responses before the TLS connection is established.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a MitM on the network connection between the vulnerable client and its server.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to intercept, modify, and inject packets into the TCP stream.
    *   No specific client-side actions or preconditions beyond using a vulnerable version of Alpine are explicitly needed.

**Additional Details from Content:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered as part of broader research on STARTTLS vulnerabilities, as highlighted in the "NO STARTTLS" paper.
*   The "NO STARTTLS" research paper mentions that many email clients and servers are vulnerable to similar STARTTLS related issues.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Alpine version 2.25, resolving both the untagged response issue and the crash related to the LIST/LSUB commands sent before STARTTLS.
*   Gentoo released a security advisory (GLSA 202301-07) to address the vulnerability, and users are advised to upgrade.
*   The issue was also assigned CVE-2021-46853, which was initially misreported by Mitre.

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-38370 in Alpine arises from improper handling of untagged server responses before the STARTTLS handshake. This makes the client vulnerable to MitM attacks that can lead to information manipulation and denial of service. The vulnerability is resolved in version 2.25 of Alpine. The related CVE-2021-46853 also involved a similar issue that could crash the client with LIST/LSUB commands prior to the secure TLS connection.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is conceptually similar to other weaknesses, such as insufficient verification and regular expression errors. It is primary to some weaknesses.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2014-6394:** Product does not prevent access to restricted directories due to partial string comparison with a public directory
- **CVE-2004-1012:** Argument parser of an IMAP server treats a partial command "body[p" as if it is "body.peek", leading to index error and out-of-bounds corruption.
- **CVE-2004-0765:** Web browser only checks the hostname portion of a certificate when the hostname portion of the URI is not a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), which allows remote attackers to spoof trusted certificates.




## CWE-180: Incorrect Behavior Order: Validate Before Canonicalize
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product validates input before it is canonicalized, which prevents the product from detecting data that becomes invalid after the canonicalization step.

### Extended Description
This can be used by an attacker to bypass the validation and launch attacks that expose weaknesses that would otherwise be prevented, such as injection.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This overlaps other categories.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-0433:** Product allows remote attackers to view restricted files via an HTTP request containing a "*" (wildcard or asterisk) character.
- **CVE-2003-0332:** Product modifies the first two letters of a filename extension after performing a security check, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via a filename with a .ats extension instead of a .hts extension.
- **CVE-2002-0802:** Database consumes an extra character when processing a character that cannot be converted, which could remove an escape character from the query and make the application subject to SQL injection attacks.




## CWE-356: Product UI does not Warn User of Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product's user interface does not warn the user before undertaking an unsafe action on behalf of that user. This makes it easier for attackers to trick users into inflicting damage to their system.

### Extended Description
Product systems should warn users that a potentially dangerous action may occur if the user proceeds. For example, if the user downloads a file from an unknown source and attempts to execute the file on their machine, then the application's GUI can indicate that the file is unsafe.
