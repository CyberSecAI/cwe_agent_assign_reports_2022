CWE-598, a variant of CWE-201, specifies the use of GET requests, but the vulnerability description lacks the specificity to confirm this. CWE-209 and CWE-319 were considered as potential related weaknesses; however, there is insufficient information to confirm the generation of error messages (CWE-209) or cleartext transmission (CWE-319).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe598[\"CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe598 -->|CHILDOF| cwe201\n    cwe209 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe201\n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe311 -->|ParentOf| cwe319\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe598 secondary\n    class cwe209,cwe319 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the **disclosure of sensitive information** in HTTP server headers. The initial flaw is the **insertion of sensitive information** into the HTTP headers (CWE-201). The impact is that this information could be used in further attacks against the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description, which states that \"IBM Security Verify Access 20.07 could **disclose sensitive information** in HTTP server headers that could be used in further attacks against the system.\" This aligns directly with CWE-201, \"Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data,\" as it describes the inclusion of sensitive data in transmitted data (in this case, HTTP headers).\n\nThe retriever results support this, with CWE-201 being a top candidate. CWE-598 was considered due to its relation to GET requests, a common method for transmitting HTTP headers, but there isn't explicit mention of GET requests. CWE-209 and CWE-319 were also considered due to the general nature of information exposure but are not directly supported by the description.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause**, which is the **insertion of sensitive information** into the sent data (HTTP headers).
