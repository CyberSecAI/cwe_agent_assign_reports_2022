This indicates a specific type of race condition, making it a more precise fit than CWE-362. The relationship between CWE-269 [Improper Privilege Management] and CWE-250 [Execution with Unnecessary Privileges] was also considered, but the direct evidence of a **TOCTOU race condition** makes CWE-367 a stronger selection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe250[\"CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\"]\n\n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe250 -->|CHILDOF| cwe269\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe367 primary\n    class cwe362 secondary\n    class cwe269 tertiary\n    class cwe250 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **TOCTOU race condition** (CWE-367), which allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code. The chain involves the attacker exiting the crashed process and exploiting PID recycling to spawn a root process with the same PID as the crashed process. This leads to privilege escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is heavily based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which identified \"**TOCTOU race condition**\" as the rootcause, and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which explicitly states, \"The vulnerability is due to a Time-Of-Check Time-Of-Use (TOCTOU) issue.\"\n\nThe graph relationships helped refine the selection to the most specific CWE. While CWE-362 is a parent of CWE-367, the explicit mention of **TOCTOU** makes the latter a more accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-367 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the race condition, which is the root cause, and the vulnerability description provides strong evidence for this classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
