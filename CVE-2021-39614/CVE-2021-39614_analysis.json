CWE-798 is a child of CWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials). Also, CWE-259 is a peer of CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) and CWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format). The secondary CWE is CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort), which is a child of CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash) and CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm). The hardcoded password was then hashed with insufficient computational effort making it easier to crack. This chain of weaknesses leads to unauthorized access.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe328\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe259 primary\n    class cwe916 secondary\n    class cwe798,cwe1391,cwe328,cwe327 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **hard-coded credentials** (CWE-259). These credentials are then stored as password hashes, but the hashing algorithm used has **insufficient computational effort** (CWE-916). The insufficient computational effort makes it easier to crack the passwords, which leads to unauthorized access to undocumented user accounts.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-259 as the primary weakness due to the presence of **hard-coded credentials**. This assessment is strongly supported by the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", both of which mention **hard-coded credentials**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also explicitly lists CWE-259 as a weakness.\n\nThe retriever results further reinforce this assessment, with CWE-259 and CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) being among the top matches. Given that the vulnerability description specifies **hard-coded credentials** in the `/etc/passwd` file, CWE-259, which is a variant of CWE-798, is the more specific and appropriate choice.\n\nAdditionally, the description mentions that weak passwords were used, and the plaintext passwords can be recovered from the hash values. This indicates that the hashing algorithm used was not strong enough, leading to CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) as a secondary weakness.\n\nThe final selection of CWEs is based on the provided evidence, the retriever results, and the relationship analysis. The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-259 being a variant and CWE-916 being a base.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password - The product contains a **hard-coded password**, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.\n- CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort - The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.",
