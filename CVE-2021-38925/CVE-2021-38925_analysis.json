Its child CWE, CWE-1240 (Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation), is a Base-level CWE. While CWE-1240 is more specific, the description indicates the algorithm itself is weak or broken, so the Class level is more appropriate than an implementation issue. CWE-327 is related to CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength), which could also describe the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n\n    cwe327 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe326 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe1240 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe326,cwe1240 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms** (CWE-327 or CWE-326), leading to the potential decryption of highly sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified CWE-327 as the primary candidate based on the **root cause: weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms**. The retriever results also listed CWE-327 as a strong candidate.\n\nCWE-327 is a Class-level CWE. The vulnerability description indicates the use of a **weaker than expected cryptographic algorithm**. This aligns with CWE-327's description: \"The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\" The impact, which is the potential decryption of highly sensitive information, underscores the severity of the weakness.\n\nCWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength) was considered as a secondary CWE. While it also aligns with the description, CWE-327 is more specific to the use of a broken or risky algorithm.\n\nCWE-1240 (Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation) was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because the description specifically highlights a weakness in the algorithm itself, rather than an implementation issue.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, representing the core weakness in the system's cryptographic implementation. The evidence directly supports the classification, and the relationship analysis confirms the relevance of the selected CWEs.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
