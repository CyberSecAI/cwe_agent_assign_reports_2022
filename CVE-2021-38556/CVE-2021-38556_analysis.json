While CWE-77 is a broader class encompassing command injection, CWE-78 specifically addresses OS command injection, which aligns directly with the vulnerability description. The CanAlsoBe relationship between CWE-78 and CWE-88 suggests argument injection as a potential related weakness, but the description focuses on command execution.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe88[\"CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe88\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe88 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements within the OS command, leading directly to the ability to **execute commands**. The root cause is the lack of adequate input validation or sanitization, and the impact is arbitrary command execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis concludes that **CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')** is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability. This determination is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly states that the vulnerability is a **command injection** vulnerability. The key phrase \"execute commands\" directly supports this classification.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"includes/configure_client.php in RaspAP 2.6.6 allows attackers to **execute commands** via **command injection**.\"\n\nThe selection is also supported by the Retriever Results, which lists CWE-78 as a highly relevant candidate. The mapping guidance for CWE-78 states that it is a Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level. The description of CWE-78, \"The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component,\" aligns perfectly with the vulnerability.\n\nI considered CWE-77, as it is a parent of CWE-78. However, given the explicit mention of OS commands in the vulnerability description, CWE-78 is more specific and therefore more appropriate. CWE-88 was also considered, as it can be related to command injection. However, the vulnerability description does not provide enough information to determine whether the issue is specifically related to argument delimiters. Therefore, I chose CWE-78, which directly addresses the **command injection** aspect.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially
