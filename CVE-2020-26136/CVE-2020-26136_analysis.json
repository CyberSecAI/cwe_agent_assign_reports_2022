CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) is a peer of CWE-420 (Unprotected Alternate Channel) and child of CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). The selection of CWE-308 is at the Base level, offering a more specific classification than its parent, CWE-1390. The relationships indicate that the vulnerability involves authentication issues and potential bypass mechanisms.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe308[\"CWE-308: Use of Single-factor Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe654[\"CWE-654: Improper Handling of Security Features\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe420[\"CWE-420: Unprotected Alternate Channel\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe308 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe308 -->|CHILDOF| cwe654\n    cwe288 -->|PEEROF| cwe420\n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe306\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe308 primary\n    class cwe288,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** that GraphQL in SilverStripe through 4.6.0-rc1 **doesn't honor MFA when using basic authentication**. This leads to the following sequence:\n1.  **Root Cause:** Default configuration of GraphQL module enables basic authentication.\n2.  **Weakness:** MFA bypass because basic authentication is accepted.\n3.  **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts and potential data breach/manipulation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitial analysis focused on the fact that the GraphQL module in Silverstripe CMS accepts basic authentication, allowing a bypass of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** indicated that the main impact was that the system \"**doesn't honour MFA (multi-factor authentication) when using basic authentication**\".\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly stated that the **root cause** of the vulnerability was the GraphQL module accepting basic authentication by default, which allowed attackers to bypass MFA.\n\nThe Retriever Results listed CWE-308 (Use of Single-factor Authentication) as the top candidate. Given the **weakness** is the bypassing of MFA, and the system is reverting to single-factor authentication (username/password), CWE-308 is the most appropriate primary CWE. The mapping guidance for CWE-308 states \"This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\" and \"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit\".\n\nCWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) was considered as a secondary CWE because the basic authentication acts as an alternate channel that bypasses the MFA.\n\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication) was also considered, but it is too general and discouraged by its mapping guidance, which suggests using CWE-1390 or CWE-306 instead.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause (CWE-308), and a bypass scenario (CWE-288).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-308: Use of Single-factor Authentication\n**CWE-308 (Use of Single-factor Authentication)** is the primary CWE. The vulnerability description clearly states that MFA is bypassed, effectively reverting to single-factor authentication. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this by stating that the default configuration of the GraphQL module enabled basic authentication, which was the main **weakness** here, leading to the MFA bypass. This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-308, which addresses the risks associated with relying solely on single-factor authentication.\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel)** is a secondary candidate. The vulnerability allows bypassing MFA through the use of basic authentication. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this bypass.\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**CWE-287 (Improper Authentication)** was considered but deemed too general. While the vulnerability does involve authentication issues, CWE-308 and CWE-288 provide a more precise characterization of the weakness. The mapping guidance for CWE-287 discourages its use when lower-level CWE entries are applicable.",
