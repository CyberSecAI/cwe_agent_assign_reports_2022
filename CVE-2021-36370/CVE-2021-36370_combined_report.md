## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced my decision was the parent-child relationship between CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation). CWE-295 is a specific type of improper authentication that occurs due to the **lack of or incorrect validation of certificates**. The description clearly states that the Midnight Commander does not check the server's fingerprint, which directly relates to certificate validation during the establishment of an SFTP connection.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing host key verification** during the SFTP connection. This **root cause** leads to a **lack of authentication**, which exposes the user to a man-in-the-middle attack. The attack can then lead to **data interception**, **data manipulation**, and ultimately a **loss of confidentiality and integrity**.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, I considered CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) as a general classification. However, the description specifically mentions that "the fingerprint of the server is neither checked nor displayed," directly indicating an issue with certificate validation. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" mentions, "The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the fact that, when the SFTP VFS (Virtual File System) was initially implemented in Midnight Commander, the fingerprints of remote hosts were computed but **not verified**." This level of detail makes CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) a more accurate and specific classification.

The retriever results also list CWE-295 as a candidate.

Therefore, I have chosen CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) as the primary CWE because it accurately describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **improper validation of certificates** during the SFTP connection. It is also a base level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-36370

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in Midnight Commander through 4.8.26. When establishing an SFTP connection, the fingerprint of the server is neither checked nor displayed. As a result, a user connects to the server without the ability to verify its authenticity.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **vector:** establish SFTP connection
- **attacker:** user
- **product:** Midnight Commander
- **version:** through 4.8.26

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36370:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the fact that, when the SFTP VFS (Virtual File System) was initially implemented in Midnight Commander, the fingerprints of remote hosts were computed but **not verified**. This means that the system would connect to a remote host, obtain its fingerprint, but would not check if that fingerprint matched a previously known or trusted fingerprint. This lack of verification opens the door to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Host Key Verification:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper verification of host keys/fingerprints during SFTP connections. The system computed the fingerprint but did not perform a check against trusted keys.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Vulnerability:**  The vulnerability exposes users to potential man-in-the-middle attacks because a malicious actor can intercept the connection and present a fake server with a forged host key. The client, not verifying the key, would connect to the malicious server believing it is the legitimate server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Interception:** A successful MitM attack could allow an attacker to intercept all data transferred between the user and the remote server, including sensitive information like passwords and other credentials.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could also manipulate data being transferred, potentially injecting malicious files or modifying existing files.
- **Loss of Confidentiality and Integrity:** Overall, a successful exploit would compromise both the confidentiality and integrity of the data exchanged over the SFTP connection.
- **Compromised User Accounts:** Stolen credentials can be used to access user accounts on the remote server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** The attack vector is a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. An attacker positions themselves between the user's machine and the legitimate SFTP server.
- **Network Interception:** This could be done by intercepting the network traffic using various techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access that allows them to intercept the communication between the Midnight Commander client and the SFTP server.
- **Ability to Impersonate the Server:** The attacker needs to be able to set up a fake server that presents a host key to the client.

**Additional Notes from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability was discovered during an audit of open-source software by Manfred KAISER from AUT-milCERT.
- The fix for this vulnerability was included in Midnight Commander version 4.8.27, which now implements the host key verification.
- The provided code snippets showcase the implementation of the fix in `connection.c` which includes:
  - Reading the `known_hosts` file.
  - Comparing the received host key against the ones stored in `known_hosts`.
  - Prompting the user to accept or reject a new or modified host key.
  - Updating the `known_hosts` file when needed.

## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30273:** SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity
- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.

## CWE-220: Storage of File With Sensitive Data Under FTP Root
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product stores sensitive data under the FTP server root with insufficient access control, which might make it accessible to untrusted parties.

### Extended Description

**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use






## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

### Extended Description


When resources are released, they can be made available for reuse. For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.


Even when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.


This weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-459
ChildOf -> CWE-212
CanPrecede -> CWE-201

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).

**[Maintenance]** This entry needs modification to clarify the differences with CWE-212. The description also combines two problems that are distinct from the CWE research perspective: the inadvertent transfer of information to another sphere, and improper initialization/shutdown. Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.

**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release
- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.
- **CVE-2003-0291:** router does not clear information from DHCP packets that have been previously used




## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30018:** A messaging platform serializes all elements of User/Group objects, making private information available to adversaries
- **CVE-2022-29959:** Initialization file contains credentials that can be decoded using a "simple string transformation"
- **CVE-2022-35411:** Python-based RPC framework enables pickle functionality by default, allowing clients to unpickle untrusted data.




## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction:** Compound
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

### Extended Description
When a web server is designed to receive a request from a client without any mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it might be possible for an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.

### Alternative Terms
Session Riding
Cross Site Reference Forgery
XSRF

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-345
ChildOf -> CWE-345
Requires -> CWE-346
Requires -> CWE-441
Requires -> CWE-642
Requires -> CWE-613

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.
**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine if other weaknesses allow CSRF attacks to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable CSRF tokens might allow bypass of CSRF protection mechanisms; if this occurs, they might be better characterized as randomness/predictability weaknesses.
**Reasons:**
- Other


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.


**[Theoretical]** 

The CSRF topology is multi-channel:


  - Attacker (as outsider) to intermediary (as user). The interaction point is either an external or internal channel.

  - Intermediary (as user) to server (as victim). The activation point is an internal channel.





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2004-1703:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag
- **CVE-2004-1995:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag
- **CVE-2004-1967:** Arbitrary code execution by specifying the code in a crafted img tag or URL




## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.
