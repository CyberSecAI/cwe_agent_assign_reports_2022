| CWE-1390 | Weak Authentication | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-476 and CWE-754 (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions). CWE-476 is a specific case of CWE-754, which means that the vulnerability is a type of improper handling of exceptional conditions that leads to a NULL pointer dereference.

The weakness occurs because the client **fails to verify** the existence of an EAP method instance before attempting to access the MSK. This **missing check** results in a **NULL pointer dereference** when trying to retrieve the MSK.

The other relationship that influenced the decision was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-1390 and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), specifically how the **early sending of an EAP-Success message** without proper authentication leads to a bypass of authentication.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect assumption** that an EAP method instance exists.

1.  **Incorrect Assumption/Missing Check:** The strongSwan client **fails to verify** the existence of an EAP method instance before attempting to access the MSK.
2.  **NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476):** This **missing check** results in a **NULL pointer dereference** when trying to retrieve the MSK.
3.  **Authentication Bypass (CWE-1390):** By sending an early EAP-Success message, an attacker can bypass client and potentially server authentication, particularly in EAP-only authentication setups. The client could accept the connection without a proper authentication process.
4.  **Denial of Service:** Sending a very early EAP-Success message can cause the IKE daemon to crash due to a NULL pointer dereference.
5.  **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** A successful authentication bypass could allow a rogue server to intercept and potentially decrypt traffic sent by the client via the VPN tunnel.
6.  **Access to Protected Networks:** In certain configurations (like TNC with mutual attestation), an attacker could also potentially access hosts behind the client, if its traffic selector included local subnets.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified both CWE-476 and CWE-1390 as potential candidates based on the vulnerability description and retriever results. After reviewing the details of the vulnerability and the CWE specifications, both CWEs were deemed applicable, with CWE-476 being the primary weakness and CWE-1390 being a secondary weakness.

The evidence supporting CWE-476 is strong, as the vulnerability description clearly states that the client attempts to access the MSK from an EAP method instance without verifying its existence, leading to a crash. The evidence is clearly visible in the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section:

"The client improperly assumed the existence of an EAP method instance upon receiving an EAP-Success message. This assumption led to a NULL pointer dereference when trying to retrieve the Master Session Key (MSK) in cases where no EAP method was initiated or completed."

This is a direct match to the description of CWE-476: "The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL."

The evidence supporting CWE-1390 is also present as the attacker can bypass authentication by sending an early EAP-Success message:

"Authentication Bypass: By sending an early EAP-Success message, an attacker can bypass client and potentially server authentication, particularly in EAP-only authentication setups. The client could accept the connection without a proper authentication process."

This also aligns with the description of CWE-1390: "The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct."

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-476 is a Base-level CWE that directly describes the NULL pointer dereference, and CWE-1390 is a Class-level CWE that describes the weak authentication mechanism.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-45079

## Vulnerability Description
In strongSwan before 5.9.5, a malicious responder can send an EAP-Success message too early without actually authenticating the client and (in the case of EAP methods with mutual authentication and EAP-only authentication for IKEv2) even without server authentication.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** send an EAP-Success message too early without actually authenticating the client
- **attacker:** malicious responder
- **product:** strongSwan
- **version:** before 5.9.5

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-45079:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the incorrect handling of early EAP-Success messages by the strongSwan EAP client implementation. The client improperly assumed the existence of an EAP method instance upon receiving an EAP-Success message. This assumption led to a NULL pointer dereference when trying to retrieve the Master Session Key (MSK) in cases where no EAP method was initiated or completed. It also allowed for authentication bypass in certain configurations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **NULL Pointer Dereference:**  The client attempts to access the MSK from an EAP method instance without verifying its existence, leading to a crash.
2.  **Authentication Bypass:** By sending an early EAP-Success message, an attacker can bypass client and potentially server authentication, particularly in EAP-only authentication setups. The client could accept the connection without a proper authentication process.
3.  **Premature EAP Conclusion:** The client prematurely concludes the EAP method upon receiving the malicious EAP-Success message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** Sending a very early EAP-Success message can cause the IKE daemon to crash due to a NULL pointer dereference.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  In EAP-only configurations, a rogue server could bypass both client and server authentication. This allows the attacker to establish a VPN tunnel without proper credentials.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** A successful authentication bypass could allow a rogue server to intercept and potentially decrypt traffic sent by the client via the VPN tunnel.
*   **Access to Protected Networks:**  In certain configurations (like TNC with mutual attestation), an attacker could also potentially access hosts behind the client, if its traffic selector included local subnets.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious VPN/AAA Server:** A compromised or rogue VPN server or AAA server sending a malicious EAP-Success message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must control or compromise the VPN or AAA server to be able to send crafted EAP-Success messages.
*   For full bypass of both client and server authentication, an EAP-only authentication scenario is required.

**Additional details:**

*   Affected Versions: All strongSwan versions since 4.1.2 are affected.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by early EAP-Success messages, which can occur before or after a specific EAP method is initiated.
*   The impact varies depending on the configuration and EAP method used. For example, certain EAP methods like EAP-MSCHAPv2, will still require the attacker to know the client's password to complete the handshake, so only authentication of the server would be bypassed.
*   Patches are provided for versions >= 5.0.1.
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by ensuring that the server authenticates using a certificate first, unless the use case makes the mutual authentication of client and server crucial.

## CWE-301: Reflection Attack in an Authentication Protocol
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
Simple authentication protocols are subject to reflection attacks if a malicious user can use the target machine to impersonate a trusted user.

### Extended Description


A mutual authentication protocol requires each party to respond to a random challenge by the other party by encrypting it with a pre-shared key. Often, however, such protocols employ the same pre-shared key for communication with a number of different entities. A malicious user or an attacker can easily compromise this protocol without possessing the correct key by employing a reflection attack on the protocol.


Reflection attacks capitalize on mutual authentication schemes in order to trick the target into revealing the secret shared between it and another valid user. In a basic mutual-authentication scheme, a secret is known to both the valid user and the server; this allows them to authenticate. In order that they may verify this shared secret without sending it plainly over the wire, they utilize a Diffie-Hellman-style scheme in which they each pick a value, then request the hash of that value as keyed by the shared secret. In a reflection attack, the attacker claims to be a valid user and requests the hash of a random value from the server. When the server returns this value and requests its own value to be hashed, the attacker opens another connection to the server. This time, the hash requested by the attacker is the value which the server requested in the first connection. When the server returns this hashed value, it is used in the first connection, authenticating the attacker successfully as the impersonated valid user.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The term "reflection" is used in multiple ways within CWE and the community, so its usage should be reviewed.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2005-3435:** product authentication succeeds if user-provided MD5 hash matches the hash in its database; this can be subjected to replay attacks.




## CWE-603: Use of Client-Side Authentication
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A client/server product performs authentication within client code but not in server code, allowing server-side authentication to be bypassed via a modified client that omits the authentication check.

### Extended Description
Client-side authentication is extremely weak and may be breached easily. Any attacker may read the source code and reverse-engineer the authentication mechanism to access parts of the application which would otherwise be protected.

### Alternative Terms
None

- **CVE-2006-0230:** Client-side check for a password allows access to a server using crafted XML requests from a modified client.




## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.

### Extended Description
Two common programmer assumptions are "this function call can never fail" and "it doesn't matter if this function call fails". If an attacker can force the function to fail or otherwise return a value that is not expected, then the subsequent program logic could lead to a vulnerability, because the product is not in a state that the programmer assumes. For example, if the program calls a function to drop privileges but does not check the return code to ensure that privileges were successfully dropped, then the program will continue to operate with the higher privileges.

- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).




## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

### Extended Description


If a web product does not properly protect assumed-immutable values from modification in hidden form fields, parameters, cookies, or URLs, this can lead to modification of critical data. Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.


For example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.


### Alternative Terms
