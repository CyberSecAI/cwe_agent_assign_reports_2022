However, the mapping guidance discourages using this CWE directly and suggests considering more specific children or related CWEs. The vulnerability also exhibits a **broken authentication mechanism** as a root cause, which suggests a relationship with CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and its child CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). Furthermore, the presence of a **path traversal vulnerability** indicates a relationship with CWE-22.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\tcwe22 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe22 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authentication** (CWE-306) for the business continuity add-on endpoints, which allows unauthenticated attackers to access these endpoints. Combined with a **path traversal vulnerability** (CWE-22) due to unsanitized user input, this leads to arbitrary file read and ultimately **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200), including secrets, API keys, and source code repositories.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-200 as the primary weakness due to the **information leakage**. However, the CWE specifications discourage direct mapping to CWE-200 and suggest considering more specific weaknesses. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides evidence of a **broken authentication mechanism** and a **path traversal vulnerability**, which are the root causes that lead to the **information leakage**. Therefore, while CWE-200 accurately describes the impact, CWE-306 and CWE-22 are more appropriate for capturing the underlying **weaknesses**. CWE-306 and CWE-22 is used as a secondary weakness because it describes the root cause of the vulnerability more accurately, and it is at the Base level of abstraction. This assessment is primarily based on the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which provides detailed information about the root cause and weaknesses.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.

As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available.
