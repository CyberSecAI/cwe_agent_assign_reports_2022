CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) is a child of CWE-287 and represents a more specific type of authentication failure. CWE-305 (Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness) indicates that the authentication is bypassed due to a separate weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe305[\"CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\"]\n\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe305 -->|RELATED| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe1390,cwe305 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **misconfiguration** of the ActiveMQ LDAP login module to use **anonymous access**. This leads to **no check on the password** for valid users, ultimately resulting in an **authentication bypass**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) seemed like the most appropriate choice, given the **root cause** of the vulnerability is that the system is not properly authenticating users, as the **anonymous access** bypasses the intended authentication mechanisms. However, the MITRE guidance discourages the use of CWE-287 directly, suggesting to consider it's children such as CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) or CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function).\n\nThe **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section highlights the use of **anonymous access to LDAP server**, leading to **no check on password for valid users**. The CVE reference summary states, \"The ActiveMQ LDAP login module could be configured to use anonymous access to the LDAP server, which allows verification of a user's password using an anonymous context, skipping password checks,\" which strongly indicates an authentication bypass.\n\nCWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) is considered as the authentication mechanism is insufficient. This is a Class-level CWE, however, and ideally a Base-level CWE should be selected.\n\nCWE-305 (Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness) is considered because the authentication is bypassed due to the **misconfiguration** of using **anonymous access**. This is a Base-level CWE, and the \"root_cause\" section in the CVE reference links content summary provides evidence for it: \"The ActiveMQ LDAP login module could be configured to use anonymous access to the LDAP server, which allows verification of a user's password using an anonymous context, skipping password checks.\"\n\nTherefore, CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is the primary CWE and CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) and CWE-305 (Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness) are secondary CWEs. While CWE-287 is discouraged, no other CWE more closely represents the vulnerability and the evidence is clear.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were

Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input,
