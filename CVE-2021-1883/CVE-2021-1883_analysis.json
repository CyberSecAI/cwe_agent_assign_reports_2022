CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (**Improper Restriction of Operations**). CWE-122 (**Heap-based Buffer Overflow**) is a variant of CWE-787. CWE-415 (**Double Free**) is a peer of CWE-416 (**Use After Free**). The selection of CWE-787 as the primary CWE is based on the direct evidence of \"**heap corruption**\" resulting from processing maliciously crafted server messages, which directly indicates an out-of-bounds write condition. The high confidence is supported by the direct match between the vulnerability description and the CWE description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe415[\"CWE-415: Double Free\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe415 --|PEEROF| cwe416\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122,cwe415 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with processing maliciously crafted server messages leading to **heap corruption**. This **heap corruption** is manifested as an **Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)**. The specific mechanism of **heap corruption** could potentially lead to a **Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122)** or **Double Free (CWE-415)**, but the provided information does not give specifics, and so these are secondary candidates.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment was based on the direct evidence of \"**heap corruption**\" described in the vulnerability description and \"**weakness:** **heap corruption**\" in the key phrases. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that \"Processing maliciously crafted server messages may lead to **heap corruption**\". This evidence strongly supports the selection of **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** as the primary CWE.\n\nThe retriever results also listed **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** with a score of 0.368, further supporting this selection. Other candidates such as **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)** and **CWE-415 (Double Free)** were considered as potential secondary CWEs because **heap corruption** can potentially manifest as these types of errors, though there is no direct evidence to confirm this.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by providing context on the hierarchical relationships between the CWEs, particularly the relationship between **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** and **CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer)**, where **CWE-787** is a child of **CWE-119**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because **CWE-787** directly represents the root cause of the vulnerability, which is writing data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer, leading to **heap corruption**. This is a base-level CWE, providing a balance between specificity and generality. The information provided does not clearly indicate a more specific variant of **CWE-787**.",
