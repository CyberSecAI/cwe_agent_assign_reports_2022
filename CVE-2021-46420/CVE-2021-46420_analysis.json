While the description mentions \"directory traversal\", the base CWE-22 is most appropriate in the absence of more specific details about the traversal method.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe24[\"CWE-24: Path Traversal: '../filedir'\"]\n    \n    cwe23 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe24 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe23,cwe24 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of:\n  1.  **ROOT CAUSE:** **Unauthenticated directory traversal** due to **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory**.\n  2.  **IMPACT:** Obtaining sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly supports CWE-22 as the primary CWE due to the explicit mention of \"**unauthenticated directory traversal**\" in the vulnerability description. The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section lists CWE-22 as the primary match and the top CWE. The retriever results also list CWE-22 as the top result.\n\nThe decision is based on the evidence: \"**unauthenticated directory traversal** vulnerability, which allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information.\"\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-22 is a base class, with more specific types of path traversal as children. Since the description doesn't specify the exact method of traversal (e.g., relative path, absolute path), the base CWE-22 is the most appropriate level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
