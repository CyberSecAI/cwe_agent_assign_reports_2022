This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-338 is a more specific case of CWE-330. CWE-328 is related to the use of weak cryptographic algorithms but focuses specifically on hashing. Choosing CWE-338 provides the best balance between specificity and accuracy based on the **insecure pseudo-random string and hashing algorithm**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe338[\"CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\"]\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    \n    cwe338 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe338 primary\n    class cwe330,cwe328 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure pseudo-random string and hashing algorithm**, leading to predictable API keys. This can be mapped as:\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-338 (**insecure pseudo-random string and hashing algorithm**)\n2.  **Impact:** Predictable API keys\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the use of an **insecure pseudo-random string and hashing algorithm**. The evidence explicitly mentions this weakness, leading to the selection of CWE-338 as the primary CWE.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-338 is a specific type of CWE-330. This reinforces the selection of CWE-338 due to its higher specificity. CWE-328 was also considered due to the mention of a hashing algorithm, but the primary issue is the weak PRNG.\n\nThe selection of CWE-338 is based on the explicit mention of an **insecure pseudo-random string and hashing algorithm** in the vulnerability description. The evidence directly supports this classification, making it the optimal choice in terms of specificity and accuracy.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
