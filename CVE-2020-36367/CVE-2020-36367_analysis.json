It has a child relationship to CWE-834 (Excessive Memory Consumption). CWE-1325 (Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation) is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling). There is no direct relationship between CWE-674 and CWE-1325.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Memory Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe1325[\"CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\"]\n\n    cwe674 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    cwe1325 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe674 primary\n    class cwe1325 secondary\n    class cwe834,cwe770 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **uncontrolled recursion** (CWE-674) due to the `parse_block`, `parse_statement`, and `parse_statement_list` functions calling each other recursively without proper checks. This leads to **stack exhaustion** and a **denial of service** (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-674 as the primary weakness, supported by the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which highlighted \"Stack overflow\" as the **weakness** and \"Denial of Service (DoS)\" as the impact. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" further solidified this by stating \"Stack exhaustion due to **uncontrolled recursion** in parsing functions\".\n\nThe evidence strongly supports CWE-674 as the primary CWE. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms the **root cause** as **uncontrolled recursion** leading to stack exhaustion, which aligns perfectly with CWE-674's description. While other CWEs like CWE-787 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) were considered, the description clearly indicates a recursion issue rather than a buffer overflow in the traditional sense.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity. While CWE-674 is a Class, it accurately represents the core weakness. A more specific child CWE might exist, but the current evidence doesn't point to a more precise classification.\n\nCWE-1325 (Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation) was considered as a secondary CWE because recursion can lead to allocating memory on the stack for each call, but there is no direct evidence that specifically says memory is being allocated.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nStack Exhaustion\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-834\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\n**CWE-674** (Uncontrolled Recursion) is the primary CWE because the **root cause** is **uncontrolled recursion**.
