CWE-89 is a child of CWE-943 [CWE-943: Improper Neutralization Across a Trust Boundary] and CWE-74 [CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')]. CWE-352 [CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] is a compound CWE that can be related because the vulnerability description mentions that the **SQL injection** can be triggered through cross-site request forgery.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization Across a Trust Boundary\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe943, cwe352 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with the **lack of sanitization** of the `id` parameter, leading to **SQL injection** (CWE-89). This can be exploited directly with administrator credentials or indirectly via CSRF (CWE-352).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **SQL injection** as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the `id` parameter is vulnerable to **SQL injection** due to the **lack of sanitization**, aligning perfectly with the description of CWE-89 [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')]. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating that the **root cause of the vulnerability** is the **lack of sanitization/filtering** of the `id` parameter, which is directly used in an SQL query. The description also mentioned that the **SQL injection** can be done either with administrator credentials or through cross-site request forgery, meaning CWE-352 [CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] is a secondary factor that can be used to trigger the **SQL injection**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] is based on the direct evidence of **SQL injection** due to the **lack of input sanitization**, as highlighted in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The confidence level is high (1.0) due to the explicit nature of the vulnerability. The inclusion of CWE-352 [CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] as a secondary factor is based on the description mentioning that this can be triggered via cross-site request forgery.\n\nCWE-79 [CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] was considered but not selected because the vulnerability is primarily an **SQL injection** issue, not a cross-site scripting issue. Similarly, CWE-502 [CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data] was not selected as there is no mention of deserialization of untrusted data. CWE-116 [CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output] was not selected because the core issue is improper neutralization of SQL special elements, not a general encoding/escaping problem. CWE-95 [CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')] was not selected as there is no evidence of dynamic code evaluation. CWE-73 [CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path] was not selected since the vulnerability doesn't directly involve external control of file names or paths.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n## Vulnerability Description\nAn exploitable **SQL injection** vulnerability exists in the forms_fields_rules/rules page of the Rukovoditel Project Management App 2.7.2. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to **SQL injection**. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability, this can be done either with administrator credentials or through cross-site request forgery.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **weakness:** **SQL injection**\n- **vector:** specially crafted HTTP request\n- **attacker:** attacker\n- **product:** Rukovoditel Project Management App\n- **version:** 2.7.2\n- **component:** forms_fields_rules/rules page\n\n### CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\n### Primary CWE Match\nCWE-89\n\n#### Top CWEs\n- CWE-89 (Count: 22)\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\n- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `id` parameter in the `forms_fields_rules/rules` page is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the **lack of sanitization/filtering**. The unsanitized `id` parameter is directly used in an SQL query.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection (CWE-89)\n- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or other malicious actions. The impact is rated as having low confidentiality and integrity impact and no availability impact.\n- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/crm/index.php?module=forms_fields_rules/rules&action=get_fields_choices` endpoint with a malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated or trigger the vulnerability through cross-site request forgery. Authentication can be done with administrator credentials.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | Base | Allowed | alternate_terms | 1.000 |\n| 2 | 352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | Compound | Allowed | sparse | 0.344 |\n| 3 | 79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.342 |\n| 4 | 502 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.339 |\n| 5 | 116 | Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.332 |\n| 6 | 95 | Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.534 |\n| 7 | 73 | External Control of File Name or Path | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 138 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.332 |\n| 9 | 918 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.330 |\n| 10 | 80 | Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.327 |",
