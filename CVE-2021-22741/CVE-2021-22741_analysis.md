|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-916 | Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered was the hierarchical relationship where CWE-916 "Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort" is a child of both CWE-328 "Use of Weak Hash" and CWE-327 "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm". While the vulnerability could potentially fall under the broader categories of weak or broken cryptography, the description specifically mentions insufficient computational effort, making CWE-916 the most precise and appropriate choice.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort**, leading to the **revealing of account credentials** when server database files are available. This exposure makes the system vulnerable to password decryption attacks.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis strongly supports the selection of CWE-916 as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort** vulnerability exists... which could cause the revealing of account credentials when server database files are available." This statement directly aligns with the definition of CWE-916, which focuses on password hashing schemes that do not provide sufficient computational effort to resist cracking attacks. The retriever results also list CWE-916 as the top combined result with a score of 0.821, further reinforcing this selection.

The choice is further solidified by the MITRE mapping guidance, which designates CWE-916 as "Allowed" and notes that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level for mapping root causes.

Other CWEs were considered but ultimately rejected. For example, CWE-328 "Use of Weak Hash" and CWE-327 "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm" are parent entries of CWE-916. Since the description provides more specific information about insufficient computational effort, using the more general parent entries would be less accurate. Similarly, CWE-759 "Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt" was considered because the absence of a salt can weaken password hashes. However, the description does not explicitly mention the lack of a salt, so CWE-916 remains the most appropriate choice.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.84
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a one-way cryptographic hash against an input that should not be reversible, such as a password, but the product does not also use a salt as part of the input.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-836: Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product records password hashes in a data store, receives a hash of a password from a client, and compares the supplied hash to the hash obtained from the data store.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
To fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense
