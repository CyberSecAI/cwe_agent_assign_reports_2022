While the vulnerability could potentially fall under the broader categories of weak or broken cryptography, the description specifically mentions insufficient computational effort, making CWE-916 the most precise and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe328\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe916 primary\n    class cwe328,cwe327 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort**, leading to the **revealing of account credentials** when server database files are available. This exposure makes the system vulnerable to password decryption attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly supports the selection of CWE-916 as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort** vulnerability exists... which could cause the revealing of account credentials when server database files are available.\" This statement directly aligns with the definition of CWE-916, which focuses on password hashing schemes that do not provide sufficient computational effort to resist cracking attacks. The retriever results also list CWE-916 as the top combined result with a score of 0.821, further reinforcing this selection.\n\nThe choice is further solidified by the MITRE mapping guidance, which designates CWE-916 as \"Allowed\" and notes that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level for mapping root causes.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but ultimately rejected. For example, CWE-328 \"Use of Weak Hash\" and CWE-327 \"Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\" are parent entries of CWE-916. Since the description provides more specific information about insufficient computational effort, using the more general parent entries would be less accurate. Similarly, CWE-759 \"Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt\" was considered because the absence of a salt can weaken password hashes. However, the description does not explicitly mention the lack of a salt, so CWE-916 remains the most appropriate choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following
