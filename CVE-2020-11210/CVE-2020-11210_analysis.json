CWE-787 is a more specific case of CWE-119, representing an out-of-bounds write, which aligns with the **memory corruption** impact described in the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper XPU configuration**, leading to a potential out-of-bounds write condition that results in **memory corruption** in the RPM region.\n  - Root Cause: **Improper XPU configuration**\n  - Weakness: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)\n  - Impact: Memory corruption\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and key phrases, which indicate that the **improper XPU configuration** leads to **memory corruption**. The selection of CWE-787 as the primary CWE is based on its specific description of an out-of-bounds write, which aligns with the reported impact.\n\nThe evidence supporting the selection of CWE-787 is the vulnerability description stating \"Possible **memory corruption** in RPM region due to **improper XPU configuration**\". This directly implies a potential write operation outside the intended memory boundaries.\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119, indicating that it is a more specific type of memory boundary violation. This specificity makes it a more appropriate choice than CWE-119 alone.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the out-of-bounds write condition leading to **memory corruption**. While other CWEs were considered, such as CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference) and CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset), they do not directly address the write aspect of the **memory corruption** issue as clearly as CWE-787.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value
