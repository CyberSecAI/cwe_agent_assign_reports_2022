# Analysis for CVE-2021-36067

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-788 | Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer | 0.7 | Base | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that impacted the decision was the parent-child relationship between CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). While CWE-119 is a parent, the description and provided CVE reference link summary specifically mention memory corruption due to insecure handling which can be classified as writing past the end of a buffer (CWE-787). CWE-788 (Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer) was considered, but the description explicitly states a "write" operation, making CWE-787 a more accurate fit. The abstraction level also influenced the decision, with a preference for the base level as per the mapping guidance.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events for this vulnerability is as follows:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Insecure handling** of a malicious Bridge file.
2.  **Weakness:** **Memory corruption** (specifically, an out-of-bounds write).
3.  **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution.

The chain starts with the insecure handling of the file, leading to memory corruption and ultimately resulting in arbitrary code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment pointed towards CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description key phrases and CVE reference link content summary, which clearly indicates **memory corruption** due to **insecure handling** leading to an access of a memory location after the end of the buffer.

The evidence supporting CWE-787 is strong: "Adobe Bridge version 11.1 (and earlier) is affected by a **memory corruption** vulnerability due to **insecure handling** of a malicious Bridge file, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the root cause as "Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer" (CWE-788), and the description specifies it as a buffer issue.

The graph relationships helped refine the selection. While CWE-119 is a parent, the more specific CWE-787 is appropriate. CWE-788 was considered because the CVE reference specifies this CWE, but the description explicitly mentions a "write" operation which makes CWE-787 the better option.

The selected CWE, CWE-787, is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately describes the **memory corruption** resulting from writing past the end of a buffer. This is a base level CWE, which aligns with mapping guidance preferences.
