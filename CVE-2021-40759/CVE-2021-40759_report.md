## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write**, which is a base-level CWE. The retriever results and vulnerability description key phrases support this selection. CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**, which is a class-level CWE. While CWE-119 is listed as the primary CWE match for similar CVE descriptions, the description for CWE-787 more accurately reflects the **memory corruption** aspect of the vulnerability due to **insecure handling** of a malicious file.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure handling** of a malicious .m4a file, leading to **memory corruption** (out-of-bounds write), and finally resulting in arbitrary code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis pointed towards CWE-787 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of **memory corruption** and **insecure handling**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that the root cause is "Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer (CWE-788)" which is similar to Out-of-bounds Write.

The vulnerability description states: "Adobe After Effects version 18.4.1 (and earlier) is affected by a **memory corruption** vulnerability due to **insecure handling** of a malicious .m4a file, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. User interaction is required in that the victim must open a specially crafted file to exploit this vulnerability."

The graph relationships show that CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119. While CWE-119 is a parent, CWE-787 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability, making it the more appropriate choice. CWE-787 is also a base-level CWE, which aligns with the preferred level of abstraction.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for Not Selecting*: This CWE relates to improper validation of input, which is not the primary weakness described in the vulnerability.

## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for Not Selecting*: The vulnerability is triggered by opening a malicious file, not by controlling the file name or path.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for Not Selecting*: This CWE relates to path equivalence issues, which are not present in the vulnerability description.

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Rationale for Not Selecting*: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability does not involve improper resource shutdown or release.

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Rationale for Not Selecting*: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability does not involve improper locking mechanisms.

## CWE-665: Improper Initialization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

*Rationale for Not Selecting*: While **improper initialization** could lead to **memory corruption**, the provided details focus on the out-of-bounds write itself.

## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for Not Selecting*: This CWE relates to improper link resolution, which is not present in the vulnerability description.

## CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Opening temporary files without appropriate measures or controls can leave the file, its contents and any function that it impacts vulnerable to attack.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for Not Selecting*: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability does not involve temporary files.

## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for Not Selecting*: The vulnerability involves an out-of-bounds write, not an out-of-bounds read.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Rationale for Not Selecting*: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability does not involve an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.
