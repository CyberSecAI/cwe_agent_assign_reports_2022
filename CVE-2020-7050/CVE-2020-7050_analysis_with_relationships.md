# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2020-7050

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-1004 | Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-79, which describes the **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**. CWE-79 is a base level CWE. CWE-79 has a peer relationship with CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery). The secondary CWE is CWE-1004, a variant of CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource), describing a **Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag**. This is related to the ability to steal authentication cookies.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **DOM-based XSS** (CWE-79) due to **improper neutralization of input**. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script. The lack of the HttpOnly flag (CWE-1004) on the session cookie allows the attacker to steal the cookie. This leads to account takeover.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability is a **DOM-based XSS** vulnerability (CWE-79) combined with a missing HttpOnly flag on the session cookie (CWE-1004). The **XSS** allows an attacker to inject malicious script into the DOM. The missing HttpOnly flag allows the attacker to steal the session cookie, leading to account takeover.

The evidence for this assessment is:
*   Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: "**weakness:** **DOM-based XSS**"
*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: "DOM-Based XSS: The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input that is used to generate dynamic content on the client side. This allows execution of malicious JavaScript code within the victim's browser." and "Lack of HttpOnly Flag: The session cookie was not set with the `HttpOnly` flag, making it accessible to JavaScript. This allowed the attacker to steal session cookies and take over accounts."

CWE-79 is the most appropriate primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause of the XSS vulnerability. CWE-1004 is a secondary CWE, as it describes a weakness that facilitates the exploitation of the XSS vulnerability.

I considered CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery) because it is a peer of CWE-79. However, CSRF is not directly relevant to this vulnerability, as the attacker is not tricking the victim into making unintentional requests.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product acts as an intermediary HTTP agent
         (such as a proxy or firewall) in the data flow between two
         entities such as a client and server, but it does not
         interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that
         are consistent with how the messages will be processed by
         those entities that are at the ultimate destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the
