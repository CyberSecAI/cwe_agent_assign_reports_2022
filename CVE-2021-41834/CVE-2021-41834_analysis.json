CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is another child of CWE-284 and a parent of CWE-863, representing the broader category of authorization issues. The relationship between CWE-863 and CWE-285 indicates a hierarchical structure, where CWE-863 provides a more specific classification than CWE-285.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper permissions validation** leading to a low-privileged user being able to read and copy any artifact.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper Permissions Validation**\n  - **Weakness:** Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863)\n  - **Impact:** Low-privileged user can read and copy any artifact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description points towards an authorization issue, stemming from **improper permissions validation**, allowing low-privileged users to access artifacts they shouldn't. The description mentions \"improper permissions validation\", which clearly indicates a problem with how permissions are being checked.\n\nThe primary selection is CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) because the vulnerability description states \"**improper permissions validation**\", which aligns directly with the definition of incorrect authorization. A low-privileged user being able to copy any artifact due to **improper permissions validation** signifies that the authorization process is flawed.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was also considered, but ultimately chosen as a secondary option. While relevant as a parent, it lacks the specificity of CWE-863. The MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-285 when more specific children are applicable.\n\nCWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) was considered because it deals with permission settings for resources, but it was not chosen as the primary CWE because the vulnerability is due to an authorization check being performed incorrectly, not an incorrect assignment of permissions.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-863 is more specific than its parent, CWE-285, and accurately reflects the nature of the vulnerability as described in the provided text. The evidence from the vulnerability description supports this classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
