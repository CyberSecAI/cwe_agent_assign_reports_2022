CWE-325 is child of CWE-573 (Missing a Critical Step in a Security Process) and has a peer relationship with CWE-358 (Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard). CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) is considered as a secondary candidate, as the **missing step** could be related to a broken or risky algorithm. CWE-327 is a Class level CWE and a child of CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe325[\"CWE-325: Missing Cryptographic Step\"]\n    cwe573[\"CWE-573: Missing a Critical Step in a Security Process\"]\n    cwe358[\"CWE-358: Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n\n    cwe325 -->|CHILDOF| cwe573\n    cwe325 -->|PEEROF| cwe358\n    cwe327 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe325 primary\n    class cwe327 secondary\n    class cwe573,cwe358,cwe693 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing cryptographic step** (CWE-325), which leads to the ability for an unauthenticated attacker to manipulate encrypted messages and recover plaintexts. The **missing cryptographic step** is the root cause.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", which both point to a **missing cryptographic step**.\n\nThe \"Vulnerability Description\" states: \"A **missing cryptographic step** in the Identity-Based Encryption service of FortiMail before 7.0.0 may allow an unauthenticated attacker who intercepts the encrypted messages to manipulate them in such a way that makes the tampering and the recovery of the plaintexts possible.\"\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"Root cause of vulnerability: A missing cryptographic step in FortiMail's Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) implementation.\"\n\nCWE-325 (Missing Cryptographic Step) is the most specific and appropriate CWE because it directly addresses the root cause described in the vulnerability. The retriever results also list CWE-325 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) was considered as a secondary CWE, but the description focuses more on the algorithm itself being flawed, rather than a step being missed.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-325: Missing Cryptographic Step\n- CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm",
