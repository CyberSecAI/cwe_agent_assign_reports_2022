The secondary CWE candidate, CWE-125 **(Out-of-bounds Read)**, is also a **Base** level CWE and a child of CWE-119. Given the evidence, CWE-787 is the stronger match. It should be noted that the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** indicates a potential for both out-of-bounds read/write scenarios, however the primary weakness explicitly stated is a **memory corruption** vulnerability, that is best captured by CWE-787.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the parsing of a specially crafted file, leading to **memory corruption**, and ultimately enabling arbitrary code execution. The root cause is the **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787), which can be triggered due to the access of a memory location after the end of the buffer.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **memory corruption** vulnerability described in the vulnerability description. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms that the root cause of the vulnerability is access of a memory location after the end of a buffer, which could lead to both out-of-bounds read and write.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 is based on the following evidence:\n\n*   **Vulnerability Description:** \"Adobe After Effects version 18.2.1 (and earlier) is affected by a **memory corruption** vulnerability when parsing a specially crafted file.\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"Root cause of vulnerability: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\", \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: A memory access after the end of a buffer, leading to a potential out-of-bounds read/write scenario.\"\n*   **Retriever Results:** CWE-787 is the top combined result with a score of 1.0.\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is selected as the primary CWE because it accurately represents the **memory corruption** vulnerability caused by writing data past the end of the intended buffer. While the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** mentions the possibility of both out-of-bounds read and write, the primary issue highlighted is **memory corruption**, making CWE-787 the more fitting choice.\n\nCWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) was considered as a secondary CWE due to the possibility of an out-of-bounds read scenario, as indicated in the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-787 being a **Base** level CWE that directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
