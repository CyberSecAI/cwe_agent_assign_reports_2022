CWE-201 is a more specific case of information exposure, making it a better fit given the details provided in the vulnerability description.\nCWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is a high-level class that is often misused, so is a secondary consideration.\nCWE-922 (Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information) is also a class, making it less specific than CWE-201.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe922[\"CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe668 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n    cwe922 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe668,cwe922 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to redact sensitive commands** in the MongoDB C# driver, leading to the **insertion of sensitive information into command started events**, which ultimately results in the **exposure of authentication credentials** and user details.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which lies in the failure to redact sensitive commands in the MongoDB C# driver. This leads to the insertion of sensitive information into sent data, specifically command started events.\n\nThe evidence supporting this assessment is derived from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which states: \"A regression was introduced in the C# driver for MongoDB due to a commit related to speculative SCRAM-SHA authentication. This resulted in **security-sensitive commands not being redacted** in command started events.\" Furthermore, the summary explicitly mentions that this **failure to redact sensitive command information** could lead to the exposure of authentication credentials.\n\nGiven this evidence, CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is the most appropriate choice. Its description aligns perfectly: \"The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes **sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor**.\" In this case, the data being transmitted are the command started events, and the sensitive information includes authentication credentials and user details.\n\nCWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) was considered but ultimately deemed less specific. While the vulnerability does result in exposure, CWE-201 directly addresses the mechanism by which the exposure occurs, namely the insertion of sensitive information into sent data. The mapping guidance for CWE-668 discourages its use as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs are applicable.\n\nCWE-922 (Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information) was also considered, but is not applicable because the sensitive data is not being stored, but being sent in events.\n\nThe selection of CWE-201 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the coding error that leads to the vulnerability. It is a Base-level CWE, which is preferred for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities. The MITRE mapping guidance allows for the use of CWE-201 in this scenario.",
