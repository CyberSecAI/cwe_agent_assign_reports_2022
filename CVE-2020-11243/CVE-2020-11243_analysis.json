These relationships suggest a broader context of error handling. There are no direct child relationships. The analysis focuses on the base level of abstraction for accurate representation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe392[\"CWE-392: Missing Report of Error Condition\"]\n    cwe755[\"CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe684[\"CWE-684: Incorrect Implementation of API\"]\n    cwe703[\"CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n\n    cwe392 -->|CHILDOF| cwe755\n    cwe392 -->|CHILDOF| cwe684\n    cwe392 -->|CHILDOF| cwe703\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe392 primary\n    class cwe755,cwe684,cwe703 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  Connection setup validation fails.\n2.  RRC **fails to report this error condition** to NAS (CWE-392).\n3.  RRC sends a connection establishment success message to NAS.\n4.  This leads to a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the denial-of-service vulnerability. The vulnerability description states that \"RRC sends a connection establishment success to NAS even though connection setup validation returns failure.\" This indicates a **failure to properly report the error condition**, which directly aligns with CWE-392 (\"Missing Report of Error Condition\").\n\nThe retriever results also suggested considering CWE-392 as a top candidate.\n\nThe confidence in this assessment is high (0.8) because the evidence directly supports the chosen CWE. The selection of CWE-392 is at the base level, which is the optimal level of specificity for this vulnerability.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n*   CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition): While race conditions can lead to errors, the primary issue here is the failure to report an existing error, not a race condition.\n*   CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read): This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to reading beyond buffer boundaries.\n*   CWE-390 (Detection of Error Condition Without Action): Similar to CWE-392, but CWE-392 is more specific in that the error is not reported.\n*   CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference) and CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset): These CWEs are not related because the vulnerability does not involve pointer dereferencing or pointer arithmetic.\n*   CWE-1288 (Improper Validation of Consistency within Input): This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to inconsistent input.\n*   CWE-781 (Improper Address Validation in IOCTL with METHOD\\_NEITHER I/O Control Code): This is not relevant as it's specific to IOCTL and not the described issue.\n*   CWE-415 (Double Free): This CWE is not related because the vulnerability does not involve freeing memory.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations

dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe
