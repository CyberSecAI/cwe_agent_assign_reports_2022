CWE-178 **Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity** is a base CWE, which is preferred. CWE-287 **Improper Authentication** and CWE-1390 **Weak Authentication** are both class level CWEs and parent CWEs of CWE-178. The vulnerability is caused by the **improper handling of case sensitivity**, so CWE-178 is the most specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe178[\"CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe178 -->|CHILDOF| cwe706[\"CWE-706: Use of Multiple Response Channels without Coordination\"]\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe178 primary\n    class cwe287,cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of case sensitivity** (CWE-178), which leads to **improper authentication** (CWE-287) and ultimately allows a user to log in without the second factor of authentication.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered the retriever results, which suggested CWE-178, CWE-287 and CWE-1390 as potential candidates. The final decision was primarily influenced by the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which highlighted the **improper handling of case sensitivity** as the root cause.\n\nThe evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description\" states: \"An **improper authentication vulnerability** in SSL VPN in FortiOS...may result in a user being able to log in successfully without being prompted for the second factor of authentication (FortiToken) if they changed the case of their username.\"\n\nThe evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"The vulnerability stems from the system's failure to properly handle username case sensitivity during authentication. If a user alters the case of their username (e.g., from \"User\" to \"user\"), they might bypass the multi-factor authentication (MFA) process.\"\n\nThe graph relationships further supported the selection of CWE-178 as the most specific and appropriate choice, as it is a base CWE that directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-287 and CWE-1390 are more general classifications that do not capture the specific weakness of **improper handling of case sensitivity**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately represent the root cause of the vulnerability and provide sufficient information for understanding and mitigating the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.395 (sparse), 4694.55 (sparse), 3.31 (graph)\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly account for differences in case sensitivity when accessing or determining the properties of a resource, leading to inconsistent results.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Technical Explanation:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the system's failure to properly handle username case sensitivity during authentication.\n\n**Security Implications:**\nAn attacker can bypass multi-factor authentication by simply changing the case of their username.\n\n**Relationships:**\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nCanPrecede -> CWE-433\nCanPrecede -> CWE-289\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.323 (sparse), 4508.81 (sparse)\n\n**Description**:\nWhen an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable.
