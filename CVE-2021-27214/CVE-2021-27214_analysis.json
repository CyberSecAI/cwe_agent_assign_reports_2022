CWE-918 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. CWE-918 is a child of CWE-441 (Unintended Proxy or Intermediary) and CWE-610 (Insufficient Control of Network Element Attributes). The vulnerability description clearly states that there is a Server-side request forgery. The secondary CWE is CWE-79, Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'). The vulnerability description states that there is Cross-site scripting.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe441[\"CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('Confused Deputy')\"]\n    cwe610[\"CWE-610: Insufficient Control of Network Element Attributes\"]\n\n    cwe918 -->|CHILDOF| cwe441\n    cwe918 -->|CHILDOF| cwe610\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe918 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n    class cwe441,cwe610 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **server-side request forgery (SSRF)** vulnerability, which allows an attacker to perform blind HTTP requests. Additionally, the attacker can perform a Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against the administrative interface.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that there is a **server-side request forgery** (SSRF) vulnerability.\nThe vulnerability description also states that the vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against the administrative interface.\n\nThe evidence to support the primary CWE is from the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section, which states:\n- **weakness:** **server-side request forgery**\n\nThe evidence to support the secondary CWE is from the **Vulnerability Description** section, which states:\n- \"perform a Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against the administrative interface\"\n\nCWE-918 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\nCWE-79 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThe following CWEs were considered but not used:\n- CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) was not selected because CWE-79 is a more general description of XSS.\n- CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') was not selected because there is no mention of SQL injection.\n- CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting') was not selected because there is no mention of CRLF injection.\n- CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) was not selected because there is no mention of CSRF.\n- CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') was not selected because the **weakness** is **server-side request forgery**.\n- CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling') was not selected because there is no mention of HTTP Request Smuggling.\n- CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference was not selected because there is no mention of XML External Entity.\n- CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag was not selected because there is no mention of cookies.\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function was not selected because the **weakness** is **server-side request forgery**.",
