The description clearly states that access tokens are not cleared after impersonation, which leads to sensitive information disclosure. The Retriever Results suggested several CWEs, including CWE-226, CWE-285, and CWE-863.\n\nCWE-226 (Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse) was selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **failure to clear** sensitive information (access tokens) after they are no longer needed. The description of CWE-226 aligns well with the vulnerability description: \"The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\"\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section doesn't have any rootcause or weakness information.\nThe \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section has \"impact: unnecessary sensitive info disclosure\" but does not have a rootcause or weakness listed, but the Vulnerability Description itself does have a rootcause: \"access tokens created as part of admins impersonation of a user are **not cleared** at the end of impersonation which may lead to unnecessary sensitive info disclosure\".\n\nOther CWEs were considered but not selected as primary:\n  - CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) were considered but deemed less relevant because the core issue is not about authorization, but about the **failure to properly manage** sensitive information.\n  - CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) was considered as a higher-level abstraction but was not selected as the primary CWE because CWE-226 provides a more specific description of the weakness. The access token created during impersonation is a resource that should be available only during the impersonation session.\n\nThe final decision was based on a combination of the vulnerability description, the CWE descriptions, and the relationships between CWEs. CWE-226 was chosen because it accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability and is at the appropriate level of specificity (Base). The confidence level is high (0.8) due to the clear alignment between the vulnerability description and the CWE description.",
