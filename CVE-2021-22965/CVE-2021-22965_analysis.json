This highlights the resource management aspect of the vulnerability. While CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE, the available information does not allow for a more specific Base-level mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource\"]\n    \n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe664 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Malformed Request:** An unauthenticated administrator sends a malformed request.\n2.  **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400):** The system fails to properly handle the malformed request, leading to excessive resource consumption.\n3.  **Denial of Service:** The excessive resource consumption results in a denial of service.\n\nThe root cause is the **improper handling** of the malformed request, which leads to the impact of a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the denial of service. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a \"**denial of service**\" caused by a \"**malformed request**\". The Retriever Results suggested CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) as a potential match.\n\nThe selection of CWE-400 is primarily based on the vulnerability description's direct mention of a denial of service. While CWE-400 is discouraged, the provided information does not offer enough detail to identify a more specific Base-level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is causing resource consumption, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake. Consider children/descendants such as CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling, CWE-771: Missing Reference to Active Allocated Resource, CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool, CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime, CWE-834: Excessive Iteration, CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification), and others.\n\nThe vulnerability description states \"A vulnerability in Pulse Connect Secure before 9.1R12.1 could allow an unauthenticated administrator to causes a **denial of service** when a **malformed request** is sent to the device.\"\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   **CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling'):** While a malformed request is mentioned, there's no indication of inconsistent interpretation between different HTTP agents. Therefore, this CWE is not selected.\n*   **CWE-287: Improper Authentication:** The description mentions an \"unauthenticated administrator,\" but the core issue is the handling of the malformed request, not the authentication process itself. Therefore, this CWE is not selected as primary.\n*   **CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input:** It's possible the malformed request contains an improperly specified quantity, but this is not explicitly stated. Without more information, selecting this CWE would be speculative.\n*   **CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value:** Similar to CWE-1284, this is a possibility, but not explicitly stated.\n*   **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation:** This is a general CWE and could apply, but is too broad.\n\nThe final decision is to assign CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) due to its direct relevance to the reported denial of service. While it's a Class-level CWE and discouraged, the provided information doesn't allow for a more specific mapping.",
