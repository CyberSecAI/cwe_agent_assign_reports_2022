# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.

### Extended Description
When a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which "permissions" are not checked, which is an "authorization" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure "Everyone: Full Control" permissions for files under the "Program Files" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.
- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.




## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-269

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** 

Note: there are 2 separate sub-categories here:

```
		- privilege incorrectly allows entities to perform certain actions
		- object is incorrectly accessible to entities with a given privilege
```




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-1981:** Roles have access to dangerous procedures (Accessible entities).
- **CVE-2002-1671:** Untrusted object/method gets access to clipboard (Accessible entities).
- **CVE-2004-2204:** Gain privileges using functions/tags that should be restricted (Accessible entities).




## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

### Extended Description


Attackers might be able to spoof the intended endpoint from a different system or process, thus gaining the same level of access as the intended endpoint.


While this issue frequently involves authentication between network-based clients and servers, other types of communication channels and endpoints can have this weakness.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30319:** S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which can be bypassed by a forged IP address.
- **CVE-2022-22547:** A troubleshooting tool exposes a web server on a random port between 9000-65535 that could be used for information gathering
- **CVE-2022-4390:** A WAN interface on a router has firewall restrictions enabled for IPv4, but it does not for IPv6, which is enabled by default




## CWE-40: Path Traversal: '\\UNC\share\name\' (Windows UNC Share)
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product accepts input that identifies a Windows UNC share ('\\UNC\share\name') that potentially redirects access to an unintended location or arbitrary file.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-36

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-0687:** FTP server allows a remote attacker to retrieve privileged web server system information by specifying arbitrary paths in the UNC format (\\computername\sharename).




## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.

### Extended Description
This issue frequently occurs during authentication, where a difference in failed-login messages could allow an attacker to determine if the username is valid or not. These exposures can be inadvertent (bug) or intentional (design).

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-203

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** can overlap errors related to escalated privileges



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-2094:** This, and others, use ".." attacks and monitor error responses, so there is overlap with directory traversal.
- **CVE-2001-1483:** Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses
- **CVE-2001-1528:** Account number enumeration via inconsistent responses.




## CWE-1386: Insecure Operation on Windows Junction / Mount Point
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product opens a file or directory, but it does not properly prevent the name from being associated with a junction or mount point to a destination that is outside of the intended control sphere.

### Extended Description


Depending on the intended action being performed, this could allow an attacker to cause the product to read, write, delete, or otherwise operate on unauthorized files.


In Windows, NTFS5 allows for file system objects called reparse points. Applications can create a hard link from one directory to another directory, called a junction point. They can also create a mapping from a directory to a drive letter, called a mount point. If a file is used by a privileged program, but it can be replaced with a hard link to a sensitive file (e.g., AUTOEXEC.BAT), an attacker could excalate privileges. When the process opens the file, the attacker can assume the privileges of that process, tricking the privileged process to read, modify, or delete the sensitive file, preventing the program from accurately processing data. Note that one can also point to registries and semaphores.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-59

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Symbolic links, hard links, junctions, and mount points can be confusing terminology, as there are differences in how they operate between UNIX-based systems and Windows, and there are interactions between them.

**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-26426:** Privileged service allows attackers to delete unauthorized files using a directory junction, leading to arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM.
- **CVE-2020-0863:** By creating a mount point and hard links, an attacker can abuse a service to allow users arbitrary file read permissions.
- **CVE-2019-1161:** Chain: race condition (CWE-362) in anti-malware product allows deletion of files by creating a junction (CWE-1386) and using hard links during the time window in which a temporary file is created and deleted.




## CWE-322: Key Exchange without Entity Authentication
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product performs a key exchange with an actor without verifying the identity of that actor.

### Extended Description
Performing a key exchange will preserve the integrity of the information sent between two entities, but this will not guarantee that the entities are who they claim they are. This may enable an attacker to impersonate an actor by modifying traffic between the two entities. Typically, this involves a victim client that contacts a malicious server that is impersonating a trusted server. If the client skips authentication or ignores an authentication failure, the malicious server may request authentication information from the user. The malicious server can then use this authentication information to log in to the trusted server using the victim's credentials, sniff traffic between the victim and trusted server, etc.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-306
CanPrecede -> CWE-923
PeerOf -> CWE-295

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use






## CWE-284: Improper Access Control
**Abstraction:** Pillar
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

### Extended Description


Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:


  - Authentication (proving the identity of an actor)

  - Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and

  - Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)

When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.

There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:


  - Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator.

  - Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.



### Alternative Terms
Authorization: The terms "access control" and "authorization" are often used interchangeably, although many people have distinct definitions. The CWE usage of "access control" is intended as a general term for the various mechanisms that restrict which users can access which resources, and "authorization" is more narrowly defined. It is unlikely that there will be community consensus on the use of these terms.

### Relationships
None

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-284 is extremely high-level, a Pillar. Its name, "Improper Access Control," is often misused in low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287] or by active use of the OWASP Top Ten, such as "A01:2021-Broken Access Control". It is not useful for trend analysis.
**Comments:** Consider using descendants of CWE-284 that are more specific to the kind of access control involved, such as those involving authorization (Missing Authorization (CWE-862), Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863), Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732), etc.); authentication (Missing Authentication (CWE-306) or Weak Authentication (CWE-1390)); Incorrect User Management (CWE-286); Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints (CWE-923); etc.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** 

This entry needs more work. Possible sub-categories include:


  - Trusted group includes undesired entities (partially covered by CWE-286)

  - Group can perform undesired actions

  - ACL parse error does not fail closed





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24985:** A form hosting website only checks the session authentication status for a single form, making it possible to bypass authentication when there are multiple forms
- **CVE-2022-29238:** Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.
- **CVE-2022-23607:** Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that "supercookies" could be sent to any domain on redirect




## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
insecure temporary file: Some people use the phrase "insecure temporary file" when referring to a link following weakness, but other weaknesses can produce insecure temporary files without any symlink involvement at all.
Zip Slip: "Zip slip" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-706
ChildOf -> CWE-706

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** 

Link following vulnerabilities are Multi-factor Vulnerabilities (MFV). They are the combination of multiple elements: file or directory permissions, filename predictability, race conditions, and in some cases, a design limitation in which there is no mechanism for performing atomic file creation operations.


Some potential factors are race conditions, permissions, and predictability.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.
- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.
- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.




## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-345
ChildOf -> CWE-345
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry has some significant overlap with other CWE entries and may need some clarification. See terminology notes.

**[Terminology]** The "Origin Validation Error" term was originally used in a 1995 thesis [REF-324]. Although not formally defined, an issue is considered to be an origin validation error if either (1) "an object [accepts] input from an unauthorized subject," or (2) "the system [fails] to properly or completely authenticate a subject." A later section says that an origin validation error can occur when the system (1) "does not properly authenticate a user or process" or (2) "does not properly authenticate the shared data or libraries." The only example provided in the thesis (covered by OSVDB:57615) involves a setuid program running command-line arguments without dropping privileges. So, this definition (and its examples in the thesis) effectively cover other weaknesses such as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), and CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges). There appears to be little usage of this term today, except in the SecurityFocus vulnerability database, where the term is used for a variety of issues, including web-browser problems that allow violation of the Same Origin Policy and improper validation of the source of an incoming message.
