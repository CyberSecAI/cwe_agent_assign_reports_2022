# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2021-28170

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-917 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability allows the evaluation of invalid EL expressions due to a **bug in the ELParserTokenManager**, leading to potential code execution by injecting special elements. |
| CWE-1336 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. While the primary issue is with EL, template engines also use expressions and are subject to similar injection issues. |
| CWE-74 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection') | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. Injection is a broad category, and the more specific CWE-917 is a better fit. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-917, which focuses on expression language injection. CWE-1336 is a peer that focuses on template engines, which often use expression languages, making it a relevant secondary consideration. CWE-74 is a parent (class) of CWE-917, representing a more general form of injection. The analysis focuses on identifying the most specific base-level CWE that accurately describes the **root cause**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **bug in the ELParserTokenManager**, which results in **improper input sanitization** and **incorrect EL expression tokenization**. This allows attackers to **bypass input sanitization controls** by injecting crafted EL expressions, potentially leading to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which highlights a **bug in the ELParserTokenManager** that leads to improper evaluation of EL expressions. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms this by stating, "A bug in the `ELParserTokenManager` allows invalid EL expressions to be evaluated as if they were valid. Specifically, the parser consumes a backslash as part of the literal expression and leaves the character following it unescaped."

This directly maps to CWE-917, which describes "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement." The retriever results also support this, with CWE-917 having the highest similarity score. CWE-1336 is considered because template engines also rely on expressions and can be subject to similar vulnerabilities. However, since the vulnerability is specifically related to the EL parser, CWE-917 is the primary and more accurate classification.

CWE-74, being a more general "Injection" class, is considered but deemed less specific than CWE-917. The relationships between these CWEs helped clarify the selection, ensuring that the most specific and relevant CWE was chosen. The selection of CWE-917 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the improper handling of special elements in EL expressions due to the **bug in the ELParserTokenManager**.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-436: Interpretation Conflict
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Product A handles inputs or steps differently than Product B, which causes A to perform incorrect actions based on its perception of B's state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
