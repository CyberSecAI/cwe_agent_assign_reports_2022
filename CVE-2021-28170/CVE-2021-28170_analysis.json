The vulnerability allows the evaluation of invalid EL expressions due to a **bug in the ELParserTokenManager**, leading to potential code execution by injecting special elements. |\n| CWE-1336 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. While the primary issue is with EL, template engines also use expressions and are subject to similar injection issues. |\n| CWE-74 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection') | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. Injection is a broad category, and the more specific CWE-917 is a better fit. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-917, which focuses on expression language injection. CWE-1336 is a peer that focuses on template engines, which often use expression languages, making it a relevant secondary consideration. CWE-74 is a parent (class) of CWE-917, representing a more general form of injection. The analysis focuses on identifying the most specific base-level CWE that accurately describes the **root cause**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe917[\"CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\"]\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe917 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe917 -- PEEROF --> cwe1336\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe917 primary\n    class cwe1336 secondary\n    class cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **bug in the ELParserTokenManager**, which results in **improper input sanitization** and **incorrect EL expression tokenization**. This allows attackers to **bypass input sanitization controls** by injecting crafted EL expressions, potentially leading to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which highlights a **bug in the ELParserTokenManager** that leads to improper evaluation of EL expressions. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this by stating, \"A bug in the `ELParserTokenManager` allows invalid EL expressions to be evaluated as if they were valid. Specifically, the parser consumes a backslash as part of the literal expression and leaves the character following it unescaped.\"\n\nThis directly maps to CWE-917, which describes \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement.\" The retriever results also support this, with CWE-917 having the highest similarity score. CWE-1336 is considered because template engines also rely on expressions and can be subject to similar vulnerabilities. However, since the vulnerability is specifically related to the EL parser, CWE-917 is the primary and more accurate classification.\n\nCWE-74, being a more general \"Injection\" class, is considered but deemed less specific than CWE-917. The relationships between these CWEs helped clarify the selection, ensuring that the most specific and relevant CWE was chosen. The selection of CWE-917 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the improper handling of special elements in EL expressions due to the **bug in the ELParserTokenManager**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
