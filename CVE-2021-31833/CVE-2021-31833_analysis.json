CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element is a child of CWE-668. This indicates a situation where the application's search path includes locations controllable by an attacker. The vulnerability involves bypassing security by renaming a binary to match an updater, indicating an authorization bypass.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe427[\"CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe427 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe427 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863) in McAfee Application and Change Control (MACC). A locally logged-in attacker can bypass the application solidification protection by renaming a binary to match a configured updater and performing specific steps. This results in the renamed binary being allowed to run, circumventing the intended security measures. An **uncontrolled search path element** (CWE-427) may be in play by allowing a renamed binary in an attacker-controlled location to be executed.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **product security bypass** due to the ability to run applications that should be prevented. The vulnerability description states that a locally logged-in attacker can circumvent the application solidification protection by renaming a specified binary to match the name of any configured updater and performing a specific set of steps.\n\nThe retriever results indicated several potential CWEs, including CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management), CWE-427 (Uncontrolled Search Path Element), and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization).\n\nCWE-269 was quickly discarded because the description focuses on the **incorrect authorization** check.\n\nCWE-427, Uncontrolled Search Path Element, is considered as a secondary candidate because the attacker needs to rename the binary to match a configured updater and the application might be using a search path that includes a location where the attacker can place the renamed binary.\n\nCWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, was selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability's core issue is the **failure** to properly authorize the execution of the renamed binary. The attacker is able to bypass the application solidification protection, which is essentially an authorization mechanism.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-863 is a Class-level CWE, but it accurately reflects the authorization failure at the heart of the vulnerability. CWE-427 is a base-level CWE and captures the search path weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
