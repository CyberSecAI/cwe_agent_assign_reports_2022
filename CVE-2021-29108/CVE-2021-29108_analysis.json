CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing) is also considered as a secondary CWE and is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication). The relationships show a progression from a general authentication issue (CWE-287) to a more specific spoofing attack (CWE-290). CWE-347 directly addresses the **improper verification** aspect highlighted in the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe290[\"CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe290 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe290 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe290,cwe287 secondary\n    class cwe1390 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of vulnerabilities starts with the **improper verification of the cryptographic signature** (CWE-347), which allows an attacker to **intercept and modify a SAML assertion**. This leads to the ability to **impersonate another account**, effectively achieving authentication bypass via spoofing.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which provides sufficient evidence to support the CWE mappings. The primary weakness identified is the **improper verification of the cryptographic signature**, which directly aligns with CWE-347. The impact of this weakness is that it allows an attacker to bypass authentication and impersonate another user, which aligns with the concepts of CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication).\n\nThe selection of CWE-347 is optimal because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the cryptographic signature verification issue. The retriever results also support this mapping, with CWE-347 being the top result.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6169.61\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale",
