It is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). There is no chain relationship mentioned for this vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of root cause and weaknesses is: **Memory Corruption** leads to Out-of-bounds Write. The vulnerability description indicates that the root cause is a **memory corruption** vulnerability, which results in out-of-bounds write.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-787 as the most likely candidate based on the **memory corruption** aspect. The retriever results also list CWE-787 as the top candidate. The vulnerability description clearly states the presence of **memory corruption**, which aligns well with the description of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-787 is a base level CWE and a child of CWE-119. The mapping guidance for CWE-787 states that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level for mapping.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-704: Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly convert an object, resource, or structure from one type to a different type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of
