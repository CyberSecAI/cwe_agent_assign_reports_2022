The vulnerability involves URL encoding, making CWE-177 a more specific fit than its parent. CWE-289 (Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name) and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) are considered as secondary candidates. CWE-289 relates to authentication bypass through name manipulation which could be related to URL encoding. CWE-306 is applicable because the **authentication** is being **bypassed**. The relationship between these CWEs helps refine the classification toward the most precise representation of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe177[\"CWE-177: Improper Handling of URL Encoding (Hex Encoding)\"]\n    cwe172[\"CWE-172: Improper Handling of Encoding or Escaping\"]\n    cwe289[\"CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe177 -->|CHILDOF| cwe172\n    cwe289 -->|PeerOf| cwe177\n    cwe306 -->|PeerOf| cwe177\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe177 primary\n    class cwe289,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of URL encoding (CWE-177)**, which leads to **authentication bypass (CWE-289/CWE-306)**, ultimately granting unauthorized access to all functionalities.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-177 as the primary candidate due to the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning URL encoding as the means of **bypassing authentication**.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"Nokia BTS TRS web console FTM_W20_FP2_2019.08.16_0010 allows Authentication Bypass...by using URL encoding for the .
