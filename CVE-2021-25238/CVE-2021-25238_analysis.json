CWE-200 can be preceded by CWE-1272 (Sensitive Information Uncleared Before Debug/Power State Transition). CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar. Due to the relationship of CWE-200 as a child of CWE-668, it provides a more specific description of the vulnerability compared to CWE-284, but it is still a high-level Class and therefore not ideal.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe1272[\"CWE-1272: Sensitive Information Uncleared Before Debug/Power State Transition\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe1272 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe284,cwe668,cwe1272 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper access control** (**ROOTCAUSE**), leading to **information disclosure** (**WEAKNESS**), and ultimately allows an unauthenticated user to obtain information about an agents managing port (**IMPACT**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the provided evidence, points to a vulnerability stemming from **improper access control** that results in **information disclosure**.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"An **improper access control** **information disclosure** vulnerability in Trend Micro OfficeScan XG SP1 and Worry-Free Business Security 10.0 SP1 could allow an unauthenticated user to obtain information about an agents managing port.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also highlights the root cause as \"The vulnerability stems from **improper access control** within the web console of Trend Micro OfficeScan\" and the weakness as \"**Improper access control** allows unauthorized access to sensitive information.\"\n\nThe retriever results list CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) as the top combined result, but it is discouraged. The retriever also provides CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), which is also discouraged due to being too high-level.\n\nGiven that the vulnerability involves both **improper access control** and **information disclosure**, a combination of CWEs might be appropriate. However, the evidence suggests that the root cause is the **improper access control** that leads to the **information disclosure**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at a higher level of abstraction (Class and Pillar) due to the lack of more specific information in the vulnerability description. While ideally, a Base or Variant CWE would be preferred, the provided evidence does not allow for a more granular classification.\n\nCWE-200 is selected as the primary CWE due to the explicit **information disclosure** aspect of the vulnerability, even though it is discouraged. CWE-284 is included as a secondary CWE to represent the **improper access control** root cause, but it is also discouraged due to its high-level nature.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
