It has child relationships to more specific CWEs, indicating there may be a more specific weakness, but the description doesn't give enough information.

This leads to bypassing intended restrictions on remote protocols. The final impact is unauthorized access or actions due to the **incorrect authorization**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **incorrect authorization** as the primary weakness due to the bypass of protocol restrictions. The vulnerability description states that \"These restrictions can be bypassed by modifying the URI string from a client.\" This indicates a problem in how the system authorizes access based on the URI.\n\nThe retriever results and complete CWE specifications support this conclusion. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a strong candidate, though it is a Class level CWE. CWE-923 (Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints) is also a good candidate.\n\nThe choice of CWE-863 is based on the fact that the core issue is that the system's authorization mechanism is not functioning correctly, allowing the bypass of intended restrictions. The evidence for this is \"These restrictions can be bypassed by modifying the URI string from a client.\"\n\nCWE-923 is a secondary candidate because the vulnerability involves a communication channel and the bypass of intended endpoints restrictions, but the core issue is **incorrect authorization**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community.
