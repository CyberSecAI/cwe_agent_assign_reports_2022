The retriever results also showed high scores for CWE-77 and CWE-78, indicating a strong relevance to the vulnerability description. The abstraction levels were also considered, with the base level of CWE-78 being preferred for its specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: OS Command Injection\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Command Injection\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper sanitization** of the `iw_serverip` parameter. This leads to **command injection** because the unsanitized input is used in a subsequent call to `iw_system`. The final impact is remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain control over the device.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a **command injection** vulnerability in Weidmueller Industrial WLAN devices. The root cause is the **improper sanitization** of the `iw_serverip` parameter, which is then used in a subsequent call to `iw_system`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands and gain control over the device.\n\nThe evidence provided supports this analysis. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly states: \"The vulnerability is due to **improper sanitization** of user-supplied input when setting the `iw_serverip` parameter which is then used in a subsequent call to `iw_system`.\" This statement directly links the **improper sanitization** to the possibility of **command injection**.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the hierarchical relationship between CWE-77 and CWE-78. While CWE-77 (Command Injection) is a broader category, CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) is more specific and accurately reflects the nature of the vulnerability, as it involves injecting commands into the operating system.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-78, is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability \u2013 the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an OS command. This is a base-level CWE, which is preferred for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThe retriever results also show a high score for CWE-78, further supporting its selection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect
