### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **vector:** invalid packet
- **product:** MoscaJS Aedes
- **version:** 0.42.0
- **component:** lib/write.js

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-13410:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper error handling within the `writeNumberCached` function of the aedes MQTT broker when processing a crafted payload. This payload has a published header and message length of 0. Specifically, when trying to create a packet for Publish Release, the stream.write() function fails because the datatype becomes an undefined array with -1 as the packet ID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper error handling: The application fails to manage errors correctly when processing specific invalid MQTT packets.
- Lack of input validation: The application doesn't validate the header and message length before processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to crash the aedes MQTT broker, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specifically crafted MQTT payload: An attacker sends a malformed MQTT packet with a published header and message length set to 0.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the MQTT broker.
- Knowledge of MQTT Protocol: The attacker needs some knowledge of the MQTT protocol to craft the specific malicious payload.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this issue was implemented in this commit: https://github.com/moscajs/aedes/pull/493. The fix includes catching writeToStream errors, which prevents the server from crashing.
- The vulnerability was reported on May 18, 2020, and fixed on May 22, 2020.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Arun Magesh.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read




## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

### Extended Description


Code frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms

ChildOf -> CWE-665
ChildOf -> CWE-400

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.
