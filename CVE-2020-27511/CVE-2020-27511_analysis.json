While CWE-407 is a broader class, CWE-1333 specifically addresses inefficiencies in regular expressions, making it a more precise fit. There are no chain relationships that were relevant in this instance.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the following:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity** (CWE-1333) in the `stripTags()` function.\n2.  **Weakness:** A crafted HTML tag is processed by the vulnerable regular expression.\n3.  **Impact:** Excessive CPU consumption leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly indicated a **regular expression denial of service** (ReDoS) in the `stripTags()` function due to an inefficient regular expression.\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-1333 is strong:\n*   \"The vulnerability is a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) found in the `stripTags()` function\"\n*   \"The `stripTags()` function uses a regular expression that is vulnerable to ReDoS attacks.\"\n*   \"The regular expression `/<\\w+(\\s+([^\\\"]*\\\"|'[^']*'|[^>])+)?(\\/)?>|<\\/\\w+>/gi` can lead to excessive backtracking when processing specially crafted input strings, causing the function to consume excessive CPU resources.\"\n*   \"An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a specially crafted input string to the `stripTags()` function, leading to excessive CPU usage and potentially making the server unresponsive.\"\n*   \"The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the `stripTags()` function. This could be through a web application that uses the Prototype library or any other application that utilizes this function.\"\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-1333 as the top match with a score of 1.0.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the inefficiency in the regular expression that leads to the denial of service. While CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity) is a parent class, CWE-1333 provides a more precise description of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-186: Overly Restrictive Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA regular expression is overly restrictive, which prevents dangerous values from being detected.\n*This CWE was not selected because the problem isn't that the regex is too restrictive, but rather that it is inefficient.*\n\n## CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression that does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values.\n*This CWE was not selected because the problem isn't that the regex is too permissive, but rather that it is inefficient.*\n\n## CWE-185: Incorrect Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product specifies a regular expression in a way that causes data to be improperly matched or compared.\n*This CWE was not selected because it is too broad, CWE-1333 is more specific to ReDoS.*\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability does not revolve around validation of unsafe equivalences in input.*\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n*This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability doesn't revolve around an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.*\n\n## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
