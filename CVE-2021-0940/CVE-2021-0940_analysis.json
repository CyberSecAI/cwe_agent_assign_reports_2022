The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**improper locking**\" as the root cause. The secondary CWE, CWE-787, \"Out-of-bounds Write,\" is a Base-level CWE and represents the weakness resulting from the **improper locking**. CWE-667 can lead to race conditions (CWE-362), which in turn could potentially lead to out-of-bounds writes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    \n    cwe362 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe667 -->|CANCAUSE| cwe362\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe667 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe362 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper locking** (CWE-667), which could lead to a race condition (CWE-362), ultimately resulting in an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787). The **improper locking** is the root cause, and the **out-of-bounds write** is the resulting weakness.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the primary cause of the vulnerability is **improper locking** (CWE-667), which leads to an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787).\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**improper locking**\" as the root cause and \"**out of bounds write**\" as the weakness. This direct evidence supports the selection of CWE-667 and CWE-787.\n\nThe graph relationships support the selection of CWE-667 as the primary cause, with CWE-787 being the consequence. CWE-362 was considered as a mid-point in the chain of events.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity. CWE-667 is a Class-level CWE that accurately describes the **improper locking** issue. CWE-787 is a Base-level CWE which represents the **out-of-bounds write** condition.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive -
