It has parent-child relationships to CWE-441 (Unintended Inclusion of Functionality) and CWE-610 (Improper Access Control). CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is also a base-level CWE and a peer of CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information). CWE-201 is a child of CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information) and it can also be CWE-209 or CWE-202 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries).\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe441[\"CWE-441: Unintended Inclusion of Functionality\"]\n    cwe610[\"CWE-610: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe202[\"CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\"]\n\n    cwe918 -->|CHILDOF| cwe441\n    cwe918 -->|CHILDOF| cwe610\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe209\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe202\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe918 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** implementation of URL-loading data sources, leading to **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**. This then exposes internal resources and potentially sensitive information.\n  - The root cause is the lack of proper validation and sanitization of URLs.\n  - The weakness is the SSRF.\n  - The impact is internal network scanning and data exfiltration.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** (CWE-918). The provided text explicitly states that the implementation of URL-loading data sources in Redash versions 10.0 and prior is vulnerable to advanced methods of **Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**. The vulnerability allows attackers to potentially scan internal networks and access internal resources. The fix involves using the Advocate library for making HTTP requests instead of the `requests` library directly, which provides more robust URL validation and protection against SSRF attacks. This confirms that the application makes HTTP requests to URLs provided by users without sufficient validation or sanitization. The high retriever score for CWE-918 also supports this classification.\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is considered as a secondary candidate because successful SSRF attacks can lead to the exposure of sensitive information. However, the vulnerability description focuses primarily on the SSRF itself rather than the specific types of information exposed, so my confidence is lower.\n\nI considered other CWEs, such as CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), but it is too general. CWE-918 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability. I also considered CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), but these are not the primary issues. The core problem is that the server makes requests to arbitrary URLs without proper validation, which is best captured by CWE-918.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-918 is a base-level CWE that accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability.",
