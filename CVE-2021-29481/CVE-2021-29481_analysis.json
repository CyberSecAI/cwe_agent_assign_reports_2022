CWE-1004 [Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag] is a related weakness that amplifies the risk because it allows the cookie to be accessed via XSS. These vulnerabilities can be considered independent, but their co-occurrence increases the potential for exploitation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe1004[\"CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag\"]\n    \n    cwe1004 -->|RELATED| cwe312\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe1004 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **lack of encryption** (CWE-312), which exposes sensitive data. The **missing HttpOnly flag** (CWE-1004) allows attackers to potentially steal the cookie via XSS. If cookies contain sensitive information, this leads to exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor (CWE-200, not explicitly mapped as it's the impact).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the description highlights that the vulnerability is due to the default configuration of client-side sessions in Ratpack where session data is stored in cookies without encryption. Although the data is signed, the **lack of encryption** is the primary issue. The **lack of the 'HttpOnly' flag** is a secondary weakness, increasing the risk of XSS attacks.\n\nThe analysis has been based on the following evidence:\n- The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"The vulnerability stems from the default configuration of client-side sessions in Ratpack, where session data is stored in cookies without encryption. Although the data is signed, it is not encrypted, making the content readable if the cookie is intercepted.\"\n- The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"Missing `httpOnly` flag: The cookies are not configured with `httpOnly`, increasing risk of exposure from XSS.\"\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity as they directly address the root causes identified in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
