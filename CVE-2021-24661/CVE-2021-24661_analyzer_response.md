# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2021-24661

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). It is a class-level CWE, suggesting that more specific base-level CWEs might exist. The secondary CWE, CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data), is a base-level CWE. The relationships show that **improper authorization** can lead to **insertion of sensitive information into sent data**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with **incorrect authorization**, allowing users with Contributor roles or higher to access password-protected or private post contents. This leads to the **insertion of sensitive information into sent data**, as the content of these restricted posts is exposed.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on authorization-related CWEs due to the **improper access control** described in the CVE details. The analysis was refined to differentiate between **missing authorization** and **incorrect authorization**. Given that the plugin *does* perform authorization checks but does so incorrectly, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was deemed more appropriate than CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). The key piece of evidence supporting this is the "PostX Gutenberg Blocks Saved Templates Addon" plugin does not properly check user permissions when displaying content from saved templates." The retriever results and similar CVE descriptions also support this choice.

Additionally, the **sensitive data disclosure** aspect of the vulnerability led to the inclusion of CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) as a secondary CWE, representing the impact of the **incorrect authorization**.

The selection of CWE-863 is based on the fact that the plugin attempts to authorize access but fails to do so correctly. This is further supported by the observed examples of CWE-863, such as CVE-2021-39155 where authorization policy bypass is caused by case-sensitive comparison.

The evidence supporting CWE-201 is derived from the vulnerability's impact: "Attackers with Contributor roles or higher can read the content of private or password-protected posts created by other users." This shows the sensitive information is being sent to unauthorized actors.

The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-863 being a Class and CWE-201 a Base CWE, providing a balance between granularity and accuracy. The graph relationships show how **incorrect authorization** can lead to **insertion of sensitive information**, solidifying the chain of events.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.
