CWE-126 is a variant of CWE-125, specifying that the out-of-bounds read occurs in a buffer. No other relationships influenced the decision.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe788[\"CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After the End of Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe126 primary\n    class cwe125 secondary\n    class cwe788 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: a wrong length is provided in RTCP packets, leading to a **buffer over-read**. There is no indication of other weaknesses.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary and most descriptive CWE for this vulnerability is CWE-126 (**Buffer Over-read**). The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Buffer over-read** while unpacking the RTCP packet we may read extra byte if wrong length is provided in RTCP packets\". The retriever results also list CWE-126 as the top combined result.\n\nCWE-126 is a Variant-level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The description of CWE-126, \"The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer,\" accurately describes the vulnerability. The description also states that \"This typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer\".\n\nOther CWEs were considered but were not as accurate:\n\n*   CWE-822 (**Untrusted Pointer Dereference**): This CWE is too general. The provided information indicates the problem is with a length value causing an over-read, not with an untrusted pointer.\n*   CWE-124 (**Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')**): This is the opposite of what's described in the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-823 (**Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset**): Similar to CWE-822, this is too general. The root cause is specifically a length issue leading to an over-read.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
