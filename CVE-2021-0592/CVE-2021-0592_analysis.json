CWE-787 is child of CWE-119, Improper Restriction of Operations within a Memory Buffer.\nCWE-1284, Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input, is included as a secondary CWE because **improper input validation** leads to the out-of-bounds write.

The **rootcause** is **improper input validation** and the **weakness** is **out of bounds writes**. This leads to remote code execution.\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions **out of bounds writes**. CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is included as a secondary CWE because the **improper input validation** is the root cause and is a prerequisite for the **out-of-bounds write** to occur.\n\nThe retriever results also list relevant CWEs such as CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset), CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input), CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), and CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation).\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 and CWE-1284 is at the optimal level of specificity because they are both Base level CWEs that directly address the **weakness** and **rootcause** described in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: There is no evidence of race conditions in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: There is no evidence of TOCTOU race conditions in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: There is no evidence of unsafe equivalence issues in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected*: There is no evidence of resource shutdown or release issues in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-606: Unchecked Input for Loop Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: There is no evidence of loop condition issues in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected*: There is no evidence of unusual or exceptional conditions",
