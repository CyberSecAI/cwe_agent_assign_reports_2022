This can lead to **CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value)**, where an attacker can influence the size value leading to allocation of arbitrary memory. CWE-190 is a base level CWE, while CWE-789 is a variant, making both reasonably specific. CWE-190 can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe789 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe789 secondary\n    class cwe119,cwe770,cwe476 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)**, which leads to **improper memory assignment**.  This can result in **CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value)**, finally leading to a crash or remote code injection/execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)** as the primary root cause, supported by explicit mentions in both the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"**integer wrap-around** in functions malloc-simple\" and \"Integer overflow or wraparound in the `malloc-simple` function of uClibc-ng.\"\n\nThe weakness then leads to **improper memory assignment**, which results in **CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value)**. This is because the integer overflow can lead to allocating an unexpected amount of memory.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection of the secondary CWE, highlighting the potential flow from an integer overflow to excessive memory allocation.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)** being a Base CWE and **CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value)** being a Variant CWE. This ensures that the classification is precise and reflects the underlying cause and potential impact of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
