This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-787 is a specific type of memory buffer issue. CWE-125 is also a child of CWE-119. The close relationship between out-of-bounds reads and writes means these are often found together.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe125,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **out-of-bounds access** which can lead to heap corruption. The vulnerability occurs in the WebAudio component when processing a crafted HTML page.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment based on the vulnerability description and the provided data strongly points to CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**) as the primary weakness. The description explicitly states \"**Out of bounds access**\" as the root cause, and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentions that the vulnerability involves an out-of-bounds memory access that can lead to heap corruption. The **CWE for similar CVE Descriptions** section also lists CWE-787 as the Primary CWE Match.\nThe evidence also supports that the out-of-bounds access is a write that can lead to heap corruption.\nCWE-125 (**Out-of-bounds Read**) was also considered, as out-of-bounds reads and writes can often occur together.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **rootcause** of the vulnerability, namely writing data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
