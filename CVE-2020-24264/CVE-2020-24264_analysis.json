CWE-863 is a related secondary weakness because the **incorrect access control** results from the failure to properly authorize actions on the server side. CWE-602 is a Class, but in this case, it accurately captures the weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe602[\"CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe602 -->|PeerOf| cwe290[\"CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe602 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe290 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of server-side enforcement** (CWE-602), leading to **incorrect access control** (CWE-863), which results in the ability to bypass intended security restrictions and potentially achieve remote code execution and Docker host takeover.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The **root cause** is the **incorrect access control** due to missing server-side enforcement of security settings. This aligns directly with CWE-602, \"Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security,\" where the product relies on client-side checks without proper server-side validation. The evidence includes:\n\n- **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** \"**incorrect access control**\" and \"restriction checks for bind mounts are applied only on the client-side and not the server-side\"\n- **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"The root cause is the lack of backend enforcement for the \"disable the use of bind mounts by non-admins\" security setting in Portainer.\" and \"While the front-end restricts the use of bind mounts, the backend does not enforce this restriction.\"\n\nCWE-863, \"Incorrect Authorization,\" is a secondary classification because the **incorrect access control** is a direct consequence of the missing server-side enforcement. While CWE-863 is a class, it doesn't fully capture the specific flaw, which is the reliance on the client side.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n- CWE-285: Improper Authorization - Considered but deemed too high-level compared to CWE-863.\n- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource - Considered but the issue isn't about incorrect permission assignment but rather the lack of server-side enforcement.\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function - Authentication isn't the primary issue here; it's about authorization and access control.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-602 capturing the primary weakness and CWE-863 as a secondary related weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
