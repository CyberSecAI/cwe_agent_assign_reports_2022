It is a child of CWE-119, which is a more general class describing improper restrictions of operations within memory buffers. The secondary CWE is CWE-502, a base-level weakness describing deserialization of untrusted data, which can lead to various vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows. There is no direct relationship between CWE-787 and CWE-502, but the incorrect deserialization (CWE-502) leads to the out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe502 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe502 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect message stream deserialization** (CWE-502), which leads to a **buffer overflow** (CWE-787). This, in turn, allows for information disclosure and data modification.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified that the Trusty vulnerability is related to an **incorrect message stream deserialization** that leads to a **buffer overflow**.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states the root cause as \"**incorrect message stream deserialization**\" and the resulting weakness as \"**buffer overflow**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section reinforces this by stating: \"**Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect message stream deserialization within the NVIDIA OTE protocol.\" and \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow due to improper deserialization of message streams.\"\n\nBased on this evidence, the primary CWE is CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), as the **buffer overflow** directly implies writing outside the intended buffer boundaries. The **incorrect message stream deserialization** is best represented by CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data), as it describes the root cause that leads to the **buffer overflow**.\n\nThe retriever results also support this analysis, with CWE-119, CWE-190, CWE-120, CWE-502, and CWE-787 being the top candidates. However, given the specific details in the vulnerability description, CWE-787 and CWE-502 are the most accurate and specific choices. CWE-119 is too general, and while CWE-120 mentions \"buffer overflow,\" it is specific to buffer copy operations without checking size, which isn't explicitly stated in this vulnerability. CWE-190 relates to integer overflows, which are not directly mentioned in the description.\n\nTherefore, the final decision is based on the clear evidence of **incorrect message stream deserialization** leading to a **buffer overflow**, making CWE-787 and CWE-502 the most appropriate CWEs. These CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, accurately representing both the root cause and the resulting weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation to determine how much memory to allocate, but an integer overflow can occur that causes less memory to be allocated than expected, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a named chain, which combines multiple weaknesses.\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
