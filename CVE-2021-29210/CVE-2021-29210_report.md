# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-29210

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE for the **remote dom xss** vulnerability. |
| CWE-93 | Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection') | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE for the **crlf injection** vulnerability. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **remote dom xss**, best represented by CWE-79, which involves improper neutralization of input during web page generation. The secondary weakness is **crlf injection**, best represented by CWE-93, which involves improper neutralization of CRLF sequences. Both CWE-79 and CWE-93 are base-level CWEs, providing a good balance between specificity and generality.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain involves two distinct injection issues:
1.  **Remote DOM XSS (CWE-79):** User-controllable input is not properly neutralized before being used in a web page, leading to potential execution of malicious scripts in the user's browser.
2.  **CRLF Injection (CWE-93):** CRLF sequences are not properly neutralized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary headers or content into HTTP responses.

Both are root causes related to improper input handling.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary vulnerability is a **remote dom xss** vulnerability which maps to CWE-79. The vulnerability description states: "A **remote dom xss**, **crlf injection** vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4) HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9 HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 HPE SimpliVity 2600 HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G HPE SimpliVity 325 HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s) Prior to version 2.78."

Based on the vulnerability description and the retriever results, the **remote dom xss** vulnerability is best represented by CWE-79 and the **crlf injection** is best represented by CWE-93.

CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) is chosen as the primary CWE because the vulnerability involves a **remote dom xss** issue. The vulnerability occurs when user-controllable input is not properly neutralized before being used in a web page, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary scripts in the user's browser. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-79.

CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')) is chosen as the secondary CWE because the vulnerability also involves a **crlf injection** issue. The vulnerability occurs when CRLF sequences are not properly neutralized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary headers or content into HTTP responses. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-93.

Other CWEs Considered:

*   CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')): While injection is a general category, CWE-79 and CWE-93 are more specific to the types of injection occurring in this vulnerability. Therefore, CWE-74 is not used.
*   CWE-113 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')): This is a variant of CWE-93 and applies when the injection occurs specifically in HTTP headers. Since the description does not limit the CRLF injection to headers, CWE-93 is a more general and appropriate choice.
*   CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')): This CWE relates to command injection, which is not mentioned in the vulnerability description.
*   CWE-117 (Improper Output Neutralization for Logs): This CWE relates to log injection, which is not mentioned in the vulnerability description.
