Since the vulnerability description specifically mentions the **missing** authorization checks, it makes CWE-862 a more precise and appropriate choice than its parent, CWE-285. CWE-352 (CSRF) is a compound weakness and a potential secondary factor due to the **missing CSRF checks**, but authorization is the primary root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe352 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe352 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** and **CSRF checks** in the AJAX action. This leads to the impact of unauthenticated users being able to delete arbitrary posts.\n\nMissing Authorization -> Arbitrary Post Deletion\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **missing authorization** and **CSRF checks** as the main weaknesses. The provided evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly supports this.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is based on the explicit mention of **missing authorization** in the vulnerability description key phrases and the detailed breakdown in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The content summary states \"The AJAX handler for deleting map posts does not include any authorization checks...\". This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-862.\n\nThe vulnerability chain highlights the direct consequence of the **missing authorization**, which is the ability to delete arbitrary posts.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the absence of authorization checks. While CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is a parent class, CWE-862 is more specific and accurately reflects the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as \"/abs/path\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
