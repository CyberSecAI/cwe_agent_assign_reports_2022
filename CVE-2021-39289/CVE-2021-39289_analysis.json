The detailed analysis of CVE-2021-39289 further clarifies the weaknesses: passwords stored in cleartext, transmitted in cleartext, or encrypted with a static key.\n\nThe primary CWE is **CWE-256 Plaintext Storage of a Password**, as it directly addresses the core issue of passwords being stored without encryption. \"Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory.\" This aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description where passwords are stored in cleartext in `/etc/default/cert-settings`.\n\nAdditional CWEs are included to cover the other aspects of the vulnerability:\n  - **CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** is relevant as it encompasses the broader issue of sensitive data being stored in cleartext.\n  - **CWE-257 Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format** is applicable due to the use of symmetric encryption with a static key, which makes the passwords easily recoverable.\n  - **CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information** is included because passwords are transmitted in cleartext within HTTP responses.\n\nCWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) was considered but not selected, as the primary issue is not the use of hard-coded credentials, but rather the insecure handling of passwords, regardless of whether they are hard-coded or not. Similarly, CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) was considered since a static key is used for encryption, but CWE-257 more directly addresses the weakness of storing passwords in an easily recoverable format due to this weak encryption.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with **CWE-256** being the most specific and directly relevant to the vulnerability. The other CWEs provide additional context and cover the other aspects of the **insecure password handling**.",
