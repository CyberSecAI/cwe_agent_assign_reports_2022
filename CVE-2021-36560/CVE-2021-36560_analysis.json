CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) is also a child of CWE-287, representing a more specific bypass method. CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) is a sibling (peer) of CWE-288. The abstraction levels guided the choice of the most specific base CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe288\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe288,cwe425 secondary\n    class cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with the **lack of authentication** on a critical function (CWE-306). This allows an attacker to directly access the admin dashboard, leading to account takeover. The ability to directly request the dashboard page (CWE-425) and the availability of an alternate, unauthenticated path (CWE-288) contribute to this bypass.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the **authentication bypass**. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" clearly pointed to this **weakness**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" provided strong evidence, stating that the application \"does not properly restrict access to the `dashboard.php` page, allowing unauthenticated users to bypass the login page.\" This supports the selection of CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) as the primary CWE, with high confidence. The graph relationships influenced the inclusion of CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) and CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) as secondary CWEs, providing a more complete picture of the vulnerability. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they directly address the **lack of authentication** for a critical function and the methods by which the authentication is bypassed.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by
