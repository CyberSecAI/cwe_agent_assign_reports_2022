There are no direct parent-child, chain, or peer relationships significantly influencing this decision based on the provided information. The analysis focuses on the core issue of resource allocation without proper limits, a foundational aspect captured by CWE-770 at the Base level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe770 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the lack of limits on resource allocation, leading directly to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n\nLack of Resource Limits -> **Out of Memory** -> Denial of Service\n\nThe root cause is the missing or inadequate resource management.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis centered around identifying the root cause of the denial-of-service vulnerability described. The description mentions \"**out of memory**\" as the direct cause, stemming from processing RRC and NAS OTA messages in Snapdragon products.\n\nGiven the **weakness** is \"**out of memory**\" while processing messages, CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is the most appropriate primary CWE. This is because the vulnerability arises from allocating resources without proper limits or throttling, eventually leading to memory exhaustion and a denial-of-service.\n\nThe retriever results did not have any strong matches. The vulnerability description key phrases point toward a resource allocation issue, which aligns well with CWE-770.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-770 is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the understanding that the root cause is a lack of resource management, specifically concerning memory allocation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
