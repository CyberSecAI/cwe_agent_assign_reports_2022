It is related to CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) as a child. The secondary CWE, CWE-522, is a class and parent of CWE-257, CWE-259, and CWE-319. The vulnerability involves sending credentials in cleartext, thus CWE-319 is a perfect fit. CWE-522 is more general and covers broader cases of insufficiently protected credentials.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe257[\"CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    \n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe257 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n    class cwe311,cwe257,cwe259 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the **cleartext transmission** of sensitive information (admin credentials).\n  - Root Cause: **Cleartext Transmission**\n  - Weakness: **Lack of Encryption**\n  - Impact: An attacker on the same network can capture these credentials.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The key evidence is that the device sends admin credentials in **cleartext**. This directly aligns with CWE-319's description: \"The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\"\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-319 is a child of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) which highlights that the **lack of encryption** is the underlying issue leading to the **cleartext transmission**.\n\nCWE-319 is chosen because it specifically describes the **transmission of sensitive information in cleartext**, which is the core of this vulnerability. It is at the Base level of abstraction, providing a good balance between specificity and generality.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of
