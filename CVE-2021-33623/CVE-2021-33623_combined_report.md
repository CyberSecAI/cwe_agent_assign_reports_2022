## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the hierarchical relationship between CWE-1333 (Base) and its parent CWE-407 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption). While CWE-1333 directly addresses the inefficient regular expression complexity, CWE-400 represents the broader impact of uncontrolled resource consumption leading to denial of service. Another important factor is the "PeerOf" relationship between CWE-625 and other input validation CWEs, like CWE-183 and CWE-184, suggesting related but distinct weaknesses concerning input handling.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **inefficient regular expression** (CWE-1333) in the `.end()` method. When a specially crafted input with many trailing newlines is processed, the regex engine consumes excessive CPU cycles due to exponential backtracking. This leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400), ultimately resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity), which accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability. This is based on the vulnerability description stating "**regular expression denial-of-service** (ReDoS) for the .end() method" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirming "This vulnerability arises due to an inefficient regular expression used to remove newlines from the end of a string." The retriever results also listed CWE-1333 with the highest score. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is included as a secondary CWE to represent the impact of the vulnerability, as the inefficient regex leads to excessive CPU usage, resulting in a denial-of-service.

CWE-625 (Permissive Regular Expression) was considered but not selected because the core issue isn't that the regular expression is too permissive, but rather that it's inefficient in terms of computational complexity. While a permissive regex *could* lead to ReDoS, in this specific case, the ReDoS stems directly from the regex's inefficient backtracking behavior. Similarly, CWE-185 (Incorrect Regular Expression) was considered, but CWE-1333 is more specific to the ReDoS vulnerability.

The selection of CWE-1333 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the inefficient regular expression complexity leading to a ReDoS attack.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-33623:

**1. Verification:**

The content from `github.com_70f8eccd_20250115_084804.html` and `github.com_dc1c2fa4_20250115_215204.html` directly mentions **CVE-2021-33623** in relation to a fix for a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability in the `trim-newlines` package. This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a ReDoS vulnerability in the `.end()` method of the `trim-newlines` JavaScript library. This vulnerability arises due to an inefficient regular expression used to remove newlines from the end of a string.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary weakness is the use of a regular expression that can cause exponential backtracking when processing specially crafted input strings with many trailing newlines. This behavior allows an attacker to trigger a Denial-of-Service by supplying an input string that will cause the regex to take an excessive amount of time to process.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This means that an attacker can provide a specially crafted string that will cause the application using the vulnerable library to hang or crash due to the excessive processing time, thereby denying service to legitimate users.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is through the input string provided to the `.end()` method. If a program uses this method and receives an external input, an attacker could craft a malicious string containing many trailing newlines to trigger the ReDoS condition.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted string as input to the vulnerable `.end()` method.
*   **Attacker Position:** The attacker does not need a privileged position. They simply need to be able to provide input data to the application that uses the vulnerable function.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability existed specifically in the `.end()` method, while other methods such as `.start()` and the main function `trimNewlines()` were not affected by the same ReDoS issue.
*   The fix for this vulnerability in commit `25246c6ce5eea1c82d448998733a6302a4350d91`, as shown in `github.com_dc1c2fa4_20250115_215204.html`, includes a refactoring of the `trimNewlines.end` and other methods to use iterative methods instead of regex replacement.
*   The fix was also backported to version 3 of the library.
*   The `test.js` diff from `github.com_dc1c2fa4_20250115_215204.html` shows new tests that confirm the lack of exponential performance, confirming the effectiveness of the fix.
*   NetApp's advisory `security.netapp.com_215b10ca_20250115_084805.html` states that the vulnerability is present in `trim-newlines` versions prior to 3.0.1 and 4.x prior to 4.0.1

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Debian LTS advisory from `lists.debian.org_785f15e3_20250115_084804.html` describes the ReDoS attack in detail as "exploited the fact that most Regular Expression implementations can reach extreme situations that cause them to work very slowly in a way that is exponentially related to the input size."
*  The provided npm page confirms the latest version is 5.0.0, and the vulnerability was fixed in 4.0.1 and 3.0.1.

**Summary:**

The `trim-newlines` library had a ReDoS vulnerability in the `.end()` method, which could lead to a Denial of Service. The vulnerability stemmed from using an inefficient regex, which was corrected through refactoring to an iterative approach. This information confirms the relevance of the provided resources for understanding and mitigating the risks associated with CVE-2021-33623.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.

### Extended Description
Some regular expression engines have a feature called "backtracking". If the token cannot match, the engine "backtracks" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.
 Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:


  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.

  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.

  - The input can be long enough.

 Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. 

### Alternative Terms
ReDoS: ReDoS is an abbreviation of "Regular expression Denial of Service".
Regular Expression Denial of Service: While this term is attack-focused, this is commonly used to describe the weakness.
Catastrophic backtracking: This term is used to describe the behavior of the regular expression as a negative technical impact.

- **CVE-2019-16215:** Markdown parser uses inefficient regex when processing a message, allowing users to cause CPU consumption and delay preventing processing of other messages.




## CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a regular expression that does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values.

### Extended Description


This effectively causes the regexp to accept substrings that match the pattern, which produces a partial comparison to the target. In some cases, this can lead to other weaknesses. Common errors include:


  - not identifying the beginning and end of the target string

  - using wildcards instead of acceptable character ranges

  - others

- **CVE-2006-1895:** ".*" regexp leads to static code injection
- **CVE-2002-2175:** insertion of username into regexp results in partial comparison, causing wrong database entry to be updated when one username is a substring of another.




## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

### Extended Description


While assertion is good for catching logic errors and reducing the chances of reaching more serious vulnerability conditions, it can still lead to a denial of service.


For example, if a server handles multiple simultaneous connections, and an assert() occurs in one single connection that causes all other connections to be dropped, this is a reachable assertion that leads to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms
assertion failure

- **CVE-2006-6811:** Chat client allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long message string when connecting to a server, which causes an assertion failure.




## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.

### Extended Description
When a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client. The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-12496:** A Go framework for robotics, drones, and IoT devices skips verification of root CA certificates by default.
- **CVE-2014-1266:** chain: incorrect "goto" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple "goto fail" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).
- **CVE-2021-22909:** Chain: router's firmware update procedure uses curl with "-k" (insecure) option that disables certificate validation (CWE-295), allowing adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) compromise with a malicious firmware image (CWE-494).




## CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype.

### Extended Description


By adding or modifying attributes of an object prototype, it is possible to create attributes that exist on every object, or replace critical attributes with malicious ones. This can be problematic if the product depends on existence or non-existence of certain attributes, or uses pre-defined attributes of object prototype (such as hasOwnProperty, toString or valueOf).


This weakness is usually exploited by using a special attribute of objects called proto, constructor or prototype. Such attributes give access to the object prototype. This weakness is often found in code that assigns object attributes based on user input, or merges or clones objects recursively.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-915
ChildOf -> CWE-913

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**

- **CVE-2019-10744:** Prototype pollution by setting default values to object attributes recursively.
- **CVE-2019-11358:** Prototype pollution by merging objects recursively.




## CWE-185: Incorrect Regular Expression
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product specifies a regular expression in a way that causes data to be improperly matched or compared.

### Extended Description
When the regular expression is used in protection mechanisms such as filtering or validation, this may allow an attacker to bypass the intended restrictions on the incoming data.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-697
CanPrecede -> CWE-187
CanPrecede -> CWE-182

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** While there is some overlap with allowlist/denylist problems, this entry is intended to deal with incorrectly written regular expressions, regardless of their intended use. Not every regular expression is intended for use as an allowlist or denylist. In addition, allowlists and denylists can be implemented using other mechanisms besides regular expressions.

**[Research Gap]** Regexp errors are likely a primary factor in many MFVs, especially those that require multiple manipulations to exploit. However, they are rarely diagnosed at this level of detail.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-2109:** Regexp isn't "anchored" to the beginning or end, which allows spoofed values that have trusted values as substrings.
- **CVE-2005-1949:** Regexp for IP address isn't anchored at the end, allowing appending of shell metacharacters.
- **CVE-2001-1072:** Bypass access restrictions via multiple leading slash, which causes a regular expression to fail.




## CWE-187: Partial String Comparison
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs a comparison that only examines a portion of a factor before determining whether there is a match, such as a substring, leading to resultant weaknesses.

### Extended Description
For example, an attacker might succeed in authentication by providing a small password that matches the associated portion of the larger, correct password.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1023

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is conceptually similar to other weaknesses, such as insufficient verification and regular expression errors. It is primary to some weaknesses.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2014-6394:** Product does not prevent access to restricted directories due to partial string comparison with a public directory
- **CVE-2004-1012:** Argument parser of an IMAP server treats a partial command "body[p" as if it is "body.peek", leading to index error and out-of-bounds corruption.
- **CVE-2004-0765:** Web browser only checks the hostname portion of a certificate when the hostname portion of the URI is not a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), which allows remote attackers to spoof trusted certificates.




## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Exhaustion

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-834

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-1285:** Deeply nested arrays trigger stack exhaustion.
- **CVE-2007-3409:** Self-referencing pointers create infinite loop and resultant stack exhaustion.
- **CVE-2016-10707:** Javascript application accidentally changes input in a way that prevents a recursive call from detecting an exit condition.




## CWE-158: Improper Neutralization of Null Byte or NUL Character
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes NUL characters or null bytes when they are sent to a downstream component.

### Extended Description
As data is parsed, an injected NUL character or null byte may cause the product to believe the input is terminated earlier than it actually is, or otherwise cause the input to be misinterpreted. This could then be used to inject potentially dangerous input that occurs after the null byte or otherwise bypass validation routines and other protection mechanisms.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-138

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be a factor in multiple interpretation errors, other interaction errors, filename equivalence, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2008-1284:** NUL byte in theme name causes directory traversal impact to be worse
- **CVE-2005-2008:** Source code disclosure using trailing null.
- **CVE-2005-3293:** Source code disclosure using trailing null.




## CWE-777: Regular Expression without Anchors
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a regular expression to perform neutralization, but the regular expression is not anchored and may allow malicious or malformed data to slip through.

### Extended Description
When performing tasks such as validating against a set of allowed inputs (allowlist), data is examined and possibly modified to ensure that it is well-formed and adheres to a list of safe values. If the regular expression is not anchored, malicious or malformed data may be included before or after any string matching the regular expression. The type of malicious data that is allowed will depend on the context of the application and which anchors are omitted from the regular expression.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
