While CWE-1333 directly addresses the inefficient regular expression complexity, CWE-400 represents the broader impact of uncontrolled resource consumption leading to denial of service. Another important factor is the \"PeerOf\" relationship between CWE-625 and other input validation CWEs, like CWE-183 and CWE-184, suggesting related but distinct weaknesses concerning input handling.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe625[\"CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression\"]\n    cwe183[\"CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe625 -->|PEEROF| cwe183\n    cwe625 -->|PEEROF| cwe184\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe625,cwe183,cwe184 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **inefficient regular expression** (CWE-1333) in the `.end()` method. When a specially crafted input with many trailing newlines is processed, the regex engine consumes excessive CPU cycles due to exponential backtracking. This leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400), ultimately resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity), which accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability. This is based on the vulnerability description stating \"**regular expression denial-of-service** (ReDoS) for the .end() method\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirming \"This vulnerability arises due to an inefficient regular expression used to remove newlines from the end of a string.\" The retriever results also listed CWE-1333 with the highest score. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is included as a secondary CWE to represent the impact of the vulnerability, as the inefficient regex leads to excessive CPU usage, resulting in a denial-of-service.\n\nCWE-625 (Permissive Regular Expression) was considered but not selected because the core issue isn't that the regular expression is too permissive, but rather that it's inefficient in terms of computational complexity. While a permissive regex *could* lead to ReDoS, in this specific case, the ReDoS stems directly from the regex's inefficient backtracking behavior. Similarly, CWE-185 (Incorrect Regular Expression) was considered, but CWE-1333 is more specific to the ReDoS vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1333 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the inefficient regular expression complexity leading to a ReDoS attack.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression that does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-185: Incorrect Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product specifies a regular expression in a way that causes data to be improperly matched or compared.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-777: Regular Expression without Anchors\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression to perform neutralization, but the regular expression is not anchored and may allow malicious or malformed data to slip through.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
