CWE-863 is a child of CWE-284 and represents an authorization check performed incorrectly. CWE-639 is a child of CWE-863 and CWE-284. The relationships guide us from general to more specific, but the provided information suggests that the access control is broken, not necessarily involving a user-controlled key.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Broken Access Control** (`ReplicationSettings!default.jspa` endpoint)\n2.  **Weakness:** Authenticated non-administrator users can edit File Replication settings.\n3.  **Impact:** Remote attackers can modify File Replication settings.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment points to **broken access control** as the primary issue. The description indicates that an authenticated non-administrator user can edit File Replication settings, which they should not be able to do.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"Affected versions of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center allow authenticated yet non-administrator remote attackers to edit the File Replication settings via a **Broken Access Control** vulnerability in the `ReplicationSettings!default.jspa` endpoint.\"\n\nThe **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section highlights:\n\n*   **rootcause:** **broken access control**\n*   **impact:** edit File Replication settings\n\nThe **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms:\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** **Broken Access Control** in the `ReplicationSettings!default.jspa` endpoint.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Non-administrator users can edit File Replication settings.\n\nGiven this evidence, the primary CWE is CWE-284 **Improper Access Control**, as it is the overarching issue. However, CWE-284 is a Pillar, and the mapping guidance discourages its use, suggesting more specific descendants.\n\nCWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** is a child of CWE-285 and represents a more specific case where authorization checks are performed incorrectly. This seems to fit the description, as there's likely an authorization check in place that is failing to prevent non-administrators from editing the settings.\n\nCWE-639 **Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key** is another possible candidate, but it's less likely since the description doesn't explicitly mention user-controlled keys being the method of bypass.\n\nGiven that CWE-284 is discouraged, I'll mark it as the primary CWE but note that it's discouraged. I'll include CWE-863 and CWE-639 as secondary candidates.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-284: Improper Access Control**\n*   Abstraction: Pillar\n*   Description: The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.\n*   Mapping Guidance: Discouraged because it's a high-level Pillar and often misused.\n\n**CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization**\n*   Abstraction: Class\n*   Description: The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n*   Mapping Guidance: Allowed-with-Review because it's a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**\n*   Abstraction: Base\n*   Description: The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n*   Mapping Guidance: Allowed.",
