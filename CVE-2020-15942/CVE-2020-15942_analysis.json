The relationship analysis shows that CWE-497 is a child of CWE-200, making it a more specific instance of sensitive information exposure. CWE-522 is a child of CWE-668 and CWE-287, highlighting a connection to resource exposure and authentication issues. While CWE-497 is a more specific base CWE, the evidence supports the broader Class of CWE-200 due to the high-level nature of the description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe497,cwe522 secondary\n    class cwe668,cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause** of storing the password in clear text, leading to the **weakness** of **information disclosure**, and the **impact** of allowing a remote authenticated attacker to read the password.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **information disclosure** vulnerability due to the password being stored in clear text.\n\nThe primary selection is CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) because the vulnerability description explicitly states that the password used by the FortiWeb scanner can be read by a remote authenticated attacker. The **root cause** is the password being stored in clear text.\n\nCWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) was considered because the cleartext password qualifies as insufficiently protected credentials. However, since the high-level description focuses on the exposure itself, CWE-200 is a more direct fit.\nCWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) was also considered because the password qualifies as sensitive system information. However, CWE-200 is a broader class that encompasses this specific scenario.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **information disclosure** aspect of the vulnerability, which is the primary concern.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:\n  - **weakness:** **information disclosure**\n- CVE Reference Links Content Summary:\n  - **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the password being stored in clear text within the Web Vulnerability Scan profile.\n  - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: **Information disclosure** vulnerability.",
