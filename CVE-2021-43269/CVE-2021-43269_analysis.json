CWE-95 is a Variant of CWE-94, offering a more specific classification for **eval injection**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe95[\"CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe95 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe95 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Eval injection** vulnerability due to improper neutralization of directives in dynamically evaluated code.\n2.  **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly suggests CWE-95 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of \"**eval injection**\" in the vulnerability description. CWE-95 directly addresses this specific type of vulnerability. The retriever results also list CWE-95 as the top combined result. CWE-94 is a valid secondary candidate due to its broader scope encompassing code injection, but CWE-95 provides a more precise classification.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is the vulnerability description stating \"**eval injection** allows an attacker to change a devices proxy configuration to use a malicious proxy auto-config (PAC) file, leading to arbitrary code execution.\" The direct mention of \"eval injection\" aligns perfectly with CWE-95.\n\nThe hierarchical relationship between CWE-94 and CWE-95 further solidifies the selection of CWE-95. As a variant of CWE-94, CWE-95 offers a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-95 recommends careful consideration of the name and description to ensure an appropriate fit, which is clearly the case here.\n\nTherefore, the selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-95 accurately representing the **eval injection** vulnerability and CWE-94 serving as a broader classification for code injection if a less specific categorization is desired.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. \"eval\").\n\n### Extended Description\nThis may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, or at least modify what code can be executed.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-94\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This perfectly aligns with CWE-95, which describes the scenario where a product fails to neutralize code syntax before using it in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g., eval()).\n    *   **Security Implications:** An attacker can inject arbitrary code by providing a malicious PAC file that exploits the **eval injection** vulnerability.
