It is a child of CWE-407 (Uncontrolled CPU Resource Consumption). CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a Class level CWE and a parent of CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling). The relationship analysis shows that the vulnerability can be described as a regular expression leading to uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Uncontrolled CPU Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe407,cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **inefficient regular expression** (CWE-1333), which, when processing a specially crafted username, leads to excessive CPU consumption and ultimately to a denial of service (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to CWE-1333 due to the **regular expression denial of service** (**ReDoS**) explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The summary states, \"The regular expression used to remove trailing `.`, `.git` or `.atom` from namespace paths is vulnerable to regular expression denial of service due to backtracking issues.\" Further supporting this is the statement \"The regex `(/(\\.atom|\\.git|\\.)*\\z/)` suffers from excessive backtracking when given long strings of periods.\" The **Retriever Results** also list CWE-1333 as the top result with a score of 1.0.\n\nCWE-400 is considered a secondary candidate because the vulnerability ultimately leads to uncontrolled resource consumption, specifically excessive CPU usage as noted in the summary: \"A malicious string can cause a maxed out CPU on the server. Repeating the attack could tie up a lot of resources on the machine running GitLab, leading to denial of service.\" However, CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE and the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1333 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **inefficient regular expression**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
