It is a child of CWE-710 and CWE-754. CWE-787, Out-of-bounds Write, is a child of CWE-119.

The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**NULL pointer dereference**\" as the weakness. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also states \"The `lcdstat` process is vulnerable to a memory corruption due to a NULL pointer dereference.\" This aligns directly with CWE-476.\n\nCWE-787 was also considered because the vulnerability description mentions \"memory corruption\". However, the root cause is specifically a **NULL pointer dereference**, so CWE-476 is the more accurate choice. The evidence clearly points to a **NULL pointer dereference** as the root cause, making CWE-476 the most specific and accurate CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n**Rationale**: The description is too general and doesn't directly address the **NULL pointer dereference**.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n**Rationale**: While related to resource management, it doesn't directly address the **NULL pointer dereference**.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n**Rationale**: This is not applicable since the vulnerability is due to a **NULL pointer dereference**, not a failure to clear sensitive data.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n**Rationale**: This is not applicable since the vulnerability is due to a **NULL pointer dereference**, not improper locking.\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n**Rationale**: While related to pointer issues, the description specifies a **NULL** pointer, making CWE-476 more precise.\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n**Rationale**: Not specific enough; the problem is not just improper initialization but a **NULL pointer dereference**.\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.\n**Rationale**: This is not the direct cause. The vulnerability is triggered by a **NULL pointer dereference**, not a missing check on a return value.\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.\n**Rationale**: Too general. The issue is a specific type of control flow problem (**NULL pointer dereference**), not a general management issue.\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n**Rationale**: Not specific enough; the vulnerability is a **NULL pointer dereference**, not just a missing initialization.\n\n## CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer.\n**Rationale**: The description does not suggest that the pointer comes from an untrusted source.\n\n## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5981.97\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.\n**Rationale**: The vulnerability description specifically mentions a **NULL pointer dereference**.\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Rationale**: The vulnerability is triggered by a **NULL pointer dereference** which results in memory corruption.\n\n## CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 3.30\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\n**Rationale**: The vulnerability description doesn't indicate a memory leak, so it is not applicable.",
