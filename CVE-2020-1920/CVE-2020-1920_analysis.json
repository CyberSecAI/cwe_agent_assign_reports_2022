It's a child of CWE-407 (Uncontrolled Processing). CWE-400 is a class-level CWE representing the broader impact of uncontrolled resource consumption, which is a consequence of the inefficient regex. Although CWE-400 is often misused, the additional information found in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary that includes excessive CPU consumption makes it a reasonable secondary consideration.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Uncontrolled Processing\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n    cwe664 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400pillar[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **inefficient regular expression** (CWE-1333), which leads to **excessive resource consumption** and ultimately results in a **denial of service**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **regular expression** as the **root cause** of a **denial of service** vulnerability. The retriever results strongly suggested CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity) as the primary candidate. The detailed CVE Reference Links Content Summary provided further evidence, explicitly stating that the vulnerability stemmed from a ReDoS flaw due to an inefficient regular expression and resulting in excessive CPU resource consumption. This solidifies the selection of CWE-1333.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was considered as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability leads to excessive resource consumption. However, CWE-400 is a high-level class, and the evidence clearly points to a more specific cause: the inefficient regular expression. While the impact is resource consumption, the root cause is the regex itself. The description states the regex can cause excessive resources, making the app unresponsive, or crash.\n\nThe final decision is to map the vulnerability primarily to CWE-1333, as it directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability. CWE-400 is a secondary consideration, representing the consequence of the vulnerability. This selection provides the optimal level of specificity and aligns with the provided evidence and MITRE's mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following

combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6429.67\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a
