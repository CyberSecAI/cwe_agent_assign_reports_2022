It is a child of CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor). The relationship shows that the generation of error messages is a specific type of information exposure. There is a CANPRECEDE relationship to CWE-756 (Missing Custom Error Page) which suggests that the absence of a custom error page can lead to the generation of default error messages with sensitive information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe756[\"CWE-756: Missing Custom Error Page\"]\n    \n    cwe209 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe756 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe209\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe209 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe756 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **web server misconfiguration**, which leads to debug mode being enabled. When an attacker generates errors during a query operation, the debug mode causes the full path of the filesystem directory to be revealed in the error message. This exposure of sensitive information is the final impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which clearly states that the **web server misconfiguration** results in debug mode being enabled. This leads to the exposure of the full path of the filesystem directory when errors are generated during a query operation.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"Hitachi Energy LinkOne product, has a vulnerability due to a **web server misconfiguration**, that enables debug mode and reveals the full path of the filesystem directory when an attacker generates errors during a query operation.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting how CWE-209 is a specific type of information exposure (child of CWE-200) and how it can be related to the absence of custom error pages (CWE-756).\n\nCWE-209 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the generation of error messages containing sensitive information, which is the core weakness in this vulnerability. Other CWEs, such as CWE-200, are more general and do not capture the specific mechanism of information exposure.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
