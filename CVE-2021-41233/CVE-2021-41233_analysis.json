CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is a broader Class-level CWE that could be considered, but CWE-201 is more specific and therefore a better fit. The vulnerability involves the Nextcloud Text application leaking folder names associated with File Drop shares, which directly aligns with the description of CWE-201. The relationship between CWE-201 and other CWEs like CWE-202 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries) and CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) are less relevant as the vulnerability isn't about data queries or error messages.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Weakness:** The Nextcloud Text application **does not properly** restrict access to folder names of File Drop shares.\n2.  **Vulnerability:** An attacker with knowledge of the sharing link is able to access the folder names.\n3.  **Impact:** Information disclosure - folder names are exposed, potentially revealing sensitive organizational structures, project names, or other sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards potential information disclosure vulnerabilities. The final decision is based on a combination of the vulnerability description and the available evidence from the CVE reference.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that \"an attacker is able to access the folder names of File Drop.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states that \"the application leaks folder names associated with file drop shares\" and that \"an attacker can learn the folder names associated with 'File Drop' shares.\"\n\nBased on this evidence, the most appropriate CWE is CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) because it directly addresses the **insertion of sensitive information** (folder names) into data that is **sent to an unauthorized actor** (the attacker).\n\nCWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) was considered but is a more general class of vulnerability. While the folder names are exposed to the wrong sphere, CWE-201 provides a more precise description of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it clearly identifies the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
