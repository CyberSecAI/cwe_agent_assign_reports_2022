CWE-190 can precede CWE-119, so it can form a vulnerability chain that can lead to out-of-bounds write.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe190 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing bounds checks** leading to a potential integer overflow. This integer overflow results in writing arbitrary bytes to a wide area of server memory which is an out-of-bounds write.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis and criticism led to a conclusion with high confidence due to the clear evidence of **missing bounds checks** leading to an out-of-bounds write. The evidence provided explicitly states the root cause and impact, leading to the selection of CWE-787 as the primary CWE. The possibility of an integer overflow (CWE-190) preceding the out-of-bounds write is also considered, making it a secondary CWE.\n\nThe assessment is based on the provided evidence, specifically:\n\n*   \"While modifying certain SQL array values, **missing bounds checks** let authenticated database users write arbitrary bytes to a wide area of server memory.\"\n*   \"The vulnerability stems from missing bounds checks in array subscripting calculations, where the combination of lower bounds and array dimensions could lead to an integer overflow. This overflow can cause array assignment logic to access memory outside the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overrun.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the connection between potential integer overflows (CWE-190) and out-of-bounds writes (CWE-787) through the common parent CWE-119.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-787 directly represents the **root cause** (out-of-bounds write), and CWE-190 represents a potential contributing factor (integer overflow) that could lead to the primary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not selected because the vulnerability is about writing to memory, not releasing resources.*\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected because the vulnerability is about writing to memory out of bounds, not allocating too much memory.*\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected because the vulnerability is about writing to memory out of bounds, not improper validation of equivalence.*\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not selected because the vulnerability is about writing to memory out of bounds, not asymmetric resource consumption.*\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected because the vulnerability is about writing to memory out of bounds, not improperly controlled sequential memory allocation.*\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected as the main cause.
