CWE-1321 can precede CWE-471. The high-level impact is CWE-94, code injection, which is related to CWE-74. The vulnerability involves prototype pollution leading to arbitrary code execution. The chain starts with the **improper modification of object prototype attributes**, and the exploitation of this weakness enables code injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1321[\"CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\"]\n    cwe915[\"CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n    cwe471[\"CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe1321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe915\n    cwe1321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe1321 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe471\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1321 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n    class cwe915,cwe913,cwe471,cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **prototype pollution** (CWE-1321), which then leads to arbitrary code execution (CWE-94).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-1321 as the most relevant based on the description indicating a **prototype pollution** attack vector. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this root cause. The impact of arbitrary code execution further supports this classification. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-1321 is a variant-level weakness, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nCWE-94 was considered as a secondary weakness due to the high-level impact of code execution.
