The vulnerability involves **missing bounds checking** which can lead to reading data past the end of a buffer. |\n| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability involves **missing bounds checking** which can lead to writing data past the end of a buffer. |\n| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Considered but not selected as the primary CWE because it is a class-level CWE and more specific CWEs are available. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-125, Out-of-bounds Read, and the secondary CWE selected is CWE-787, Out-of-bounds Write. These are both base-level CWEs and children of the class-level CWE-119, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer. The vulnerability description clearly states **missing bounds checking** which can cause operations to occur outside of the intended buffer boundaries. Because the impact could be information disclosure, the read is the more relevant CWE. Because the impact could be escalation of privileges, the write is the more relevant CWE.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing bounds checking** in the HDCP service TA within Trusty. This **missing bounds checking** leads to operations outside of the intended buffer boundaries, resulting in information disclosure, denial of service, or escalation of privileges. Therefore, the chain is: **Missing Bounds Checking** -> Out-of-bounds Read/Write -> Information Disclosure/DoS/Privilege Escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **missing bounds checking** in command 11 of the HDCP service TA. The vulnerability description key phrases highlighted the **missing bounds checking** as the root cause and the potential impacts (information disclosure, denial of service, and escalation of privileges). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirmed the **missing bounds checking** as the root cause and the potential impacts.\n\nThe Retriever Results listed CWE-119, CWE-125 and CWE-787 as the top three matches.\nCWE-119 is a class-level CWE and is discouraged when more specific CWEs are available. The description indicates that the **missing bounds checking** directly leads to operations outside of the intended buffer boundaries, so both out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) and out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) are applicable.\n\nThe final decision was to assign CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) because the **missing bounds checking** leads to read and write operations outside the buffer. These CWEs are at the base level of abstraction. The evidence strongly supports these classifications, and the confidence level is high.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-191 was not selected as there is no evidence of integer underflow.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-131 was not selected as the root cause is **missing bounds checking**, not incorrect calculation of buffer size.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-197 was not selected as there is no evidence of numeric truncation.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-193 was not selected as the root cause is **missing bounds checking**, not specifically an off-by-one error.\n\n## CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-823 was not selected as the root cause is **missing bounds checking**, not specifically the use of an out-of-range pointer offset.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-1289 was not selected as there is no evidence of unsafe equivalence.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
