This is a Class-level CWE. A more specific Base-level CWE that relates to client-side authentication is CWE-603. Authorization issues arise as a consequence of failing to validate permissions on the server-side, leading to potential authorization vulnerabilities like CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe602[\"CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security\"]\n    cwe603[\"CWE-603: Use of Client-Side Authentication\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe603 -->|CHILDOF| cwe602\n    cwe603 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe602 primary\n    class cwe603,cwe863,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** of **client-side permission checks**, specifically the **lack of server-side enforcement**, which is the root cause (CWE-602). This leads to a failure to properly authenticate users on the server (CWE-603). The absence or incorrect implementation of authorization checks (CWE-863, CWE-285) allows attackers to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a high confidence in assigning CWE-602 as the primary weakness because the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** specifically identifies the **client-side permission checks** as a **weakness**, and the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** explicitly states that the root cause is the client-side enforcement of server-side security.\n\nThe graph relationships highlight the connection between client-side enforcement, authentication, and authorization, reinforcing the selection of CWE-602 as the primary weakness. The additional CWEs (CWE-603, CWE-863, CWE-285) are included to capture the authentication and authorization flaws that stem from the primary weakness.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the technical details of the vulnerability, focusing on the root cause (CWE-602) and its immediate consequences (CWE-603, CWE-863, CWE-285).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is composed of a server that relies on the client to implement a mechanism that is intended to protect the server.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-603: Use of Client-Side Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA client/server product performs authentication within client code but not in server code, allowing server-side authentication to be bypassed via a modified client that omits the authentication check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product compares two entities in a security-relevant context, but the comparison is incorrect, which may lead to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.
