CWE-614 (Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute) is another variant that is a child of CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information). The vulnerability directly states the **failure to set the HTTPOnly flag**, which makes CWE-1004 the most specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1004[\"CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag\"]\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Security-Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe1004 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1004 primary\n    class cwe614,cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to set the HTTPOnly flag**, leading to the potential **exposure of sensitive information from the cookie** to a remote attacker.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis and the retriever results both pointed towards CWE-1004 (Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag) as the most relevant CWE. The vulnerability description clearly states the **root cause** as the **failure to set the HTTPOnly flag**, which directly aligns with the description of CWE-1004. The relationship analysis further solidifies this choice, as CWE-1004 is a variant-level weakness, providing a specific representation of the vulnerability. The retriever results also list CWE-1004 as the top combined result.\n\n*   The selection is based on the following evidence:\n    *   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** \"**rootcause:** **failure to set HTTPOnly flag**\"\n    *   **Retriever Results:** CWE-1004 is the top combined result.\n    *   **CWE-1004 Description:** \"The product uses a cookie to store sensitive information, but the cookie is not marked with the HttpOnly flag.\"\n\nCWE-614 (Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute) was considered because it also relates to cookie security. However, the vulnerability description specifically mentions the HTTPOnly flag, making CWE-1004 a more precise match. CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) was also considered but is less specific to the **root cause**, as it describes the general issue of transmitting sensitive information in cleartext.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **failure to set the HTTPOnly flag**, which is the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1236: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by a spreadsheet product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
