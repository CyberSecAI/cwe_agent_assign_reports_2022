The vulnerability description specifically mentions \"plain-text password storage\" which aligns directly with CWE-312. CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) is related as the passwords are being stored in log files.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe532 secondary\n    class cwe311 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **plain-text password storage** (**CWE-312**) in log files (**CWE-532**), leading to potential unauthorized access by a local authenticated attacker.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-312, as the root cause is storing passwords in cleartext. The vulnerability description clearly states \"plain-text password storage vulnerability\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms \"Plain-text password storage. User credentials, including the Unisphere admin privilege user password, are stored in plain text within multiple log files.\" The retriever results also list CWE-312 as a strong candidate. The evidence strongly supports this classification, and the confidence level is high. The mapping guidance for CWE-312 indicates it is at the Base level of abstraction and its usage is Allowed.\n\nCWE-532 is included as a secondary CWE since the **plain-text password** is stored in the log files, and a local authenticated attacker with access to the log files may use the exposed password to gain access.\n\nCWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) was considered, but CWE-312 is a better fit because it highlights the broader issue of storing sensitive information in cleartext, rather than specifically focusing on passwords. The description of CWE-312 explicitly mentions that sensitive information is stored in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\nCWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) was considered, but it is a Class-level CWE. Both CWE-312 and CWE-532 are more specific and provide better descriptions of the vulnerability.\n```",
