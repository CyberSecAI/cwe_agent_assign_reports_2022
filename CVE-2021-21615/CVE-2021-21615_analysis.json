The vulnerability description clearly indicates a Time-of-check Time-of-use (**TOCTOU**) **race condition**. CWE-367 is a child of CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')), but CWE-367 is more specific and accurately represents the weakness. CWE-59 is a possible secondary candidate since the **TOCTOU** condition is related to symbolic links.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n\n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe363[\"CWE-363: Race Condition Enabling Link Following\"]\n    cwe363 -->|CHILDOF| cwe367\n    cwe363 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe59\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe367 primary\n    class cwe362,cwe59,cwe363 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **TOCTOU race condition** (CWE-367), which allows for the possibility of following symbolic links to read arbitrary files.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points towards CWE-367 due to the explicit mention of a **TOCTOU race condition**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that the vulnerability is caused by a **TOCTOU race condition** when handling symbolic links. The ability to read arbitrary files is the impact of this vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-367 is based on the following evidence:\n*   The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **TOCTOU race condition**.\n*   The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the **TOCTOU race condition** as the root cause.\n\nThe retriever results list CWE-367 as the second-best match. The retriever also lists CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')) and CWE-363 (Race Condition Enabling Link Following), which are related to the use of symbolic links in the attack. Since the root cause is a **TOCTOU race condition**, CWE-367 is chosen as the primary CWE. CWE-59 is added as a secondary candidate to show the impact of the **TOCTOU race condition** which allows symbolic links to be followed.\n\nThe final decision is to select CWE-367 as the primary CWE because it accurately captures the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
