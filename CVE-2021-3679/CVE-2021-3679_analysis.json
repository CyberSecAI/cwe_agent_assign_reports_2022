It has a ChildOf relationship with CWE-834 (Incorrect Control Flow Leading to Critical State). A secondary CWE is CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), which is also a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption). These relationships helped refine the selection to the most specific and relevant CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe835[\"CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Incorrect Control Flow Leading to Critical State\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe835 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe835 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n    class cwe834,cwe400 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **bug** in the `rb_per_cpu_empty()` function, leading to an **incorrect conditional evaluation**. This results in a **deadloop** (CWE-835) which leads to **resource starvation** and a **denial of service**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards resource exhaustion and infinite loops. The provided evidence, particularly the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, clearly indicates that the **root cause** is a **bug** in the `rb_per_cpu_empty()` function that results in a **deadloop**. This aligns strongly with CWE-835 (Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')).\n\nThe vulnerability description states \"A flaw in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality could allow a privileged local user (with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) to cause a denial of service (resource starvation).\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section contains the following supporting evidence:\n*   \"The rb_per_cpu_empty() function in the Linux kernel tracing module has a bug where it misinterprets the condition for an empty ring buffer leading to a deadloop.\"\n*   \"Denial of service due to resource starvation\"\n*   \"Infinite looping\"\n*   \"Incorrect conditional evaluation in rb_per_cpu_empty()\"\n\nCWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) was considered because resource starvation is mentioned, but the **root cause** is the infinite loop, not the lack of limits or throttling on resource allocation. The infinite loop *causes* the resource starvation, making CWE-835 the more appropriate primary classification.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **root cause** (CWE-835) and a contributing factor (CWE-770) of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is about improper resource release, which is not the main issue here.
