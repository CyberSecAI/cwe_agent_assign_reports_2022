This CWE is a base level weakness. It is related to CWE-328 (**Use of Weak Hash**) and CWE-327 (**Incomplete or Missing Cryptographic Algorithm**). The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **use of password hash with insufficient computational effort**, making CWE-916 the most appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Incomplete or Missing Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    \n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe328\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe916 primary\n    class cwe328,cwe327 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Use of password hash with insufficient computational effort** (CWE-916).\n2.  **Impact:** Remote attackers can recover the plain-text password by brute-forcing the MD5 hash.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability.
