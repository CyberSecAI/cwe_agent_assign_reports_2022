The other CWEs were considered based on the retriever results.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe494[\"CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe79 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe494\n    cwe79 -->|PEEROF| cwe352\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe494,cwe352 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the following steps:\n1.  A user provides input, specifically a complex SQL query.\n2.  The application fails to properly neutralize this input.\n3.  The un-neutralized input is used to generate a web page.\n4.  The generated web page contains malicious script.\n5.  A user's browser executes the malicious script, leading to XSS.\n\nThe root cause is the **improper neutralization** of the input, and the impact is the execution of malicious script in the user's browser.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly pointed towards CWE-79, which aligns directly with the vulnerability description stating a \"**Cross-site scripting**\" **weakness** due to **improper handling** of SQL queries, allowing injection of malicious scripts. The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms this.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**Cross-site scripting** vulnerability is present in Database Performance Monitor 2022.1.7779 and previous versions when using a complex SQL query\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the **root cause of the vulnerability** is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue caused by **improper handling** of SQL queries. This is strong evidence supporting the selection of CWE-79.\n\nThe selection of CWE-79 as the primary weakness is based on the evidence that the application **does not properly sanitize or encode** user-supplied data within SQL queries, leading to XSS.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 8641.05\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-87\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-86\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-85\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-84\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-83\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 3.30\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-564\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-456\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-74\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-943\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-89\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
