## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain involves the following steps:
1.  A user provides input, specifically a complex SQL query.
2.  The application fails to properly neutralize this input.
3.  The un-neutralized input is used to generate a web page.
4.  The generated web page contains malicious script.
5.  A user's browser executes the malicious script, leading to XSS.

The root cause is the **improper neutralization** of the input, and the impact is the execution of malicious script in the user's browser.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment strongly pointed towards CWE-79, which aligns directly with the vulnerability description stating a "**Cross-site scripting**" **weakness** due to **improper handling** of SQL queries, allowing injection of malicious scripts. The evidence from the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section confirms this.

The vulnerability description explicitly mentions "**Cross-site scripting** vulnerability is present in Database Performance Monitor 2022.1.7779 and previous versions when using a complex SQL query". The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms that the **root cause of the vulnerability** is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue caused by **improper handling** of SQL queries. This is strong evidence supporting the selection of CWE-79.

The selection of CWE-79 as the primary weakness is based on the evidence that the application **does not properly sanitize or encode** user-supplied data within SQL queries, leading to XSS.

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: base
**Similarity Score**: 5.03
**Source**: graph

**Description**:
CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: base
**Similarity Score**: 3.30
**Source**: graph

**Description**:
CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.
