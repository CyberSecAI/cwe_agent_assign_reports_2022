# Analysis for CVE-2021-21605

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-73 | External Control of File Name or Path | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE identified is CWE-73 **[External Control of File Name or Path]**, which is a Base level CWE. The vulnerability description indicates that users with Agent/Configure permission can choose agent names that cause Jenkins to override the global `config.xml` file, directly aligning with the concept of external control over file paths.

CWE-22 **[Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')]** is considered as a secondary CWE because the CVE description mentions that the vulnerability allows for path traversal by including characters in the agent name that could lead to overwriting the global `config.xml` file.

The relationship between CWE-73 and CWE-22 is that CWE-73 can precede CWE-22. This means that external control of a file name or path (CWE-73) can lead to path traversal (CWE-22) if proper validation is not performed.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **[External Control of File Name or Path]** (CWE-73), followed by **[Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')]** (CWE-22), leading to the impact of overriding the global `config.xml` file.
1.  **Root Cause:** The root cause is the **inadequate validation** of agent names, allowing external control over file paths (CWE-73).
2.  **Weakness:** Path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22).
3.  **Impact:** Overwriting of the global `config.xml` file.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified CWE-73 **[External Control of File Name or Path]** as the primary weakness due to the vulnerability stemming from insufficient validation of agent names, allowing users to control the file path. The CVE summary explicitly mentions this **external control**, stating that users with Agent/Configure permission can choose agent names that cause Jenkins to override the global `config.xml` file.

The inclusion of CWE-22 **[Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')]** is justified because the CVE summary notes that the vulnerability allows for **path traversal** by including characters in the agent name. This is a direct consequence of the **improper** handling of pathnames.

The final decision is based on the provided evidence, specifically the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which explicitly mentions both external control of file names and path traversal. The graph relationship analysis further supports this decision, as CWE-73 can precede CWE-22.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause and the immediate consequence of the vulnerability. CWE-73 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred for mapping root causes, and CWE-22 is also a Base level CWE that accurately describes the path traversal aspect of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:
- **CWE-73 [External Control of File Name or Path]**: This CWE is selected because the vulnerability allows users to control the file path through agent names. The description of CWE-73 states, "The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations," which perfectly matches the vulnerability.
- **CWE-22 [Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')]**: This CWE is selected because the vulnerability allows for path traversal, which is a direct consequence of the external control of file names. The description of CWE-22 states, "The product uses external input to construct a pathname...but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory," which aligns with the path traversal aspect of the vulnerability.

CWEs considered but not used:
- CWE-863 **[Incorrect Authorization]** was considered because the vulnerability requires "Agent/Configure" permission, but the core issue is not an authorization flaw but rather the **lack of validation** of agent names leading to path traversal.
- CWE-276 **[Incorrect Default Permissions]** was not selected because the vulnerability is not directly related to default file permissions but rather the **inadequate validation** of agent names.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.

## CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product creates a temporary file in a directory whose permissions allow unintended actors to determine the file's existence or otherwise access that file.

### Extended Description
On some operating systems, the fact that the temporary file exists may be apparent to any user with sufficient privileges to access that directory. Since the file is visible, the application that is using the temporary file could be known. If one has access to list the processes on the system, the attacker has gained information about what the user is doing at that time. By correlating this with the applications the user is running, an attacker could potentially discover what a user's actions are. From this, higher levels of security could be breached.

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

### Extended Description


This could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.


Path manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:

```
		1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.
		2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.
```
For example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.

**[Relationship]** 

The external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.


However, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.


The external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.
- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.




## CWE-838: Inappropriate Encoding for Output Context
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses or specifies an encoding when generating output to a downstream component, but the specified encoding is not the same as the encoding that is expected by the downstream component.

### Extended Description


This weakness can cause the downstream component to use a decoding method that produces different data than what the product intended to send. When the wrong encoding is used - even if closely related - the downstream component could decode the data incorrectly. This can have security consequences when the provided boundaries between control and data are inadvertently broken, because the resulting data could introduce control characters or special elements that were not sent by the product. The resulting data could then be used to bypass protection mechanisms such as input validation, and enable injection attacks.


While using output encoding is essential for ensuring that communications between components are accurate, the use of the wrong encoding - even if closely related - could cause the downstream component to misinterpret the output.


For example, HTML entity encoding is used for elements in the HTML body of a web page. However, a programmer might use entity encoding when generating output for that is used within an attribute of an HTML tag, which could contain functional Javascript that is not affected by the HTML encoding.


While web applications have received the most attention for this problem, this weakness could potentially apply to any type of product that uses a communications stream that could support multiple encodings.
