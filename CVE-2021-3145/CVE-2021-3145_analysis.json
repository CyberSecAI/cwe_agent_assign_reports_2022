It is related to CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) as a child. The vulnerability description indicates a bypass of biometric authentication, suggesting that the primary weakness lies in how the authentication mechanism is implemented or configured, allowing for a bypass.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe305[\"CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe305 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe305 primary\n    class cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **primary weakness** that allows a local root attacker to bypass biometric authentication. The final impact is the **bypass of biometric authentication**, which enables unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several potential CWEs, with CWE-305 (Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness) and CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) being strong candidates.\n\nThe description \"local root attacker on an Android device can **bypass biometric authentication**\" indicates that the authentication mechanism itself has a **primary weakness**. This bypass leads directly to the ability to circumvent biometric authentication.\n\nCWE-305 (Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness) aligns well with this scenario, as it describes a situation where the authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed due to a separate, **primary weakness**.\n\nCWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) is a more general class that could also apply, but CWE-305 provides a more precise description of the vulnerability. Therefore, CWE-305 is at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nThe evidence directly supports the selection of CWE-305. The vulnerability description indicates a direct bypass, suggesting a **fundamental flaw** in the implementation, not merely a weak algorithm (CWE-1390).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed as the result of a separate weakness that is primary to the authentication error.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n### CWEs Considered But Not Used\n\n*   **CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)**: This CWE was not selected because the vulnerability involves bypassing existing authentication, not the absence of it.\n*   **CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data)**: Deserialization is not mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n*   **CWE-267 (Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions)**: This CWE does not fit the bypass of authentication, which is the core issue.\n*   **CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing)**: Spoofing is not mentioned.\n*   **CWE-613 (Insufficient Session Expiration)**: Session management is not the focus.\n*   **CWE-287 (Improper Authentication)**: This is a broader category, and CWE-305 is more specific.\n*   **CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource)** and **CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization)**: These are authorization issues, not authentication bypasses.",
