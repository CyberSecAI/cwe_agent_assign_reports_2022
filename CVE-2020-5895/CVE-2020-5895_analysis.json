While it has child relationships (ChildOf -> CWE-285, ChildOf -> CWE-668), none of the children are more specific matches for the given vulnerability description. CWE-400 which is a Class-level CWE and related to resource consumption, denial of service, and improper resource shutdown.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe668,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with the **AVRD uses world-readable and world-writable permissions on its socket** (CWE-732), which allows a local system attacker to write malformed messages to the socket, leading to AVRD segmentation fault (SIGSEGV).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description states that **AVRD uses world-readable and world-writable permissions on its socket**, which is the root cause of the vulnerability. This allows local attackers to write malformed messages to the socket, causing a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV). The primary weakness is **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732)**, as the overly permissive permissions on the socket allow unauthorized access and manipulation.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest **CWE-732**, and the description aligns well with the vulnerability, \"The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates that successful exploitation could lead to Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nCWE-400 was considered because the vulnerability leads to a denial of service, but the root cause is the improper permissions.\nCWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions) was also considered, but the description specifies the permissions on a socket, not necessarily an installation issue.\n\nMy confidence is high because the root cause aligns directly with the CWE-732 description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
