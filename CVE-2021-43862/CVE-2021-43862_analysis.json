The weakness here is directly related to the **improper neutralization** of user input which results in XSS. The `Retriever Results` confirm that CWE-79 is the best fit for this vulnerability. CWE-79 is a base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input sanitization**, leading to the **cross-site scripting** vulnerability, and ultimately allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the provided vulnerability description and supporting evidence, the primary weakness is **CWE-79** Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'). This is because the root cause of the vulnerability is **improper input sanitization** which allows for the injection of malicious code into the web page. The `Vulnerability Description Key Phrases` identifies **cross-site scripting** as a weakness, and the `CVE Reference Links Content Summary` clearly states that the library failed to sanitize or encode special characters within the input.\n\nThe `Retriever Results` also indicate that **CWE-79** is the best match with a score of 0.991. The description of **CWE-79** aligns perfectly with the vulnerability where user-controllable input is not neutralized before being placed in the output used as a web page. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that can be executed by other users.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but not selected because they were either too high-level or did not accurately represent the root cause of the vulnerability. For example, **CWE-116** Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output is a Class-level CWE, and while it is related to output handling, it is not as specific as **CWE-79**. Similarly, **CWE-352** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a Compound CWE that describes a different type of vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-79** is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the XSS vulnerability caused by **improper input sanitization**. The evidence from the vulnerability description, `CVE Reference Links Content Summary`, and `Retriever Results` all support this classification.",
