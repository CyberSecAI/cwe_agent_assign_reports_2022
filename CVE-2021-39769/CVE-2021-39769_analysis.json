CWE-203 **Observable Discrepancy** is considered as a secondary factor, since the ability to determine if an app is installed without proper permissions leads to an observable difference in behavior.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    \n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe203 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe203 secondary\n    class cwe284,cwe285,cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check**, leading to the ability to determine whether an app is installed, resulting in local information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **missing permission check** as the root cause. The provided description clearly states this **weakness**, supporting the selection of CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**. The ability to determine if an app is installed without proper permissions leads to an observable discrepancy in behavior, making CWE-203 a secondary consideration.\nThe decision is strongly based on the evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\": \"rootcause: **missing permission check**\" and \"impact: determine whether an app is installed\".\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the **missing authorization** issue. Other more specific CWEs related to race conditions, improper initialization, or covert channels were considered but not selected because they didn't directly address the root cause of the **missing permission check**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
