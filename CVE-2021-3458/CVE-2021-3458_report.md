# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-3458

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-288 | Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-306, which represents the **missing authentication** for a critical function. CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) is a peer of CWE-420 (Unprotected Alternate Channel), which is related to the described scenario where the configuration portal can be accessed without authentication, effectively providing an alternate path. CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) is related because the configuration portal is directly accessible without proper authorization checks. The abstraction levels of these CWEs (Base) are optimal for representing the root cause.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of root cause and weaknesses is:
1.  **Missing Authentication** (CWE-306) for the device configuration portal.
2.  Direct access to the configuration portal without proper authorization (CWE-425).
3.  Alternate path to access the configuration portal (CWE-288).
4.  Impact: Adapter settings can be modified without authentication.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the **missing authentication** aspect described in the vulnerability. The description clearly states that the device configuration portal can be accessed without authentication. This directly points to CWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, which fits the scenario perfectly. "The Motorola MM1000 device configuration portal can be accessed without authentication, which could allow adapter settings to be modified." This is a clear indication that a critical function (access to the device configuration portal) lacks authentication.

CWE-288 and CWE-425 were considered as secondary CWEs because they represent different facets of the same **missing authentication** issue. CWE-288 highlights the existence of an alternate path, while CWE-425 emphasizes the direct access aspect.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity (Base) because they directly represent the **root cause** of the vulnerability.
