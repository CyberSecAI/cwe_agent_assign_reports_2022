The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. |\n| CWE-285 | Improper Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. |\n| CWE-732 | Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary candidate. The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**. It is a class-level CWE, and the guidance suggests examining its children for a more specific fit. CWE-862 is a child of both CWE-285 **Improper Authorization** and CWE-284. CWE-732 **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource** is also related, as it is a child of CWE-285 **Improper Authorization** and CWE-668.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe732 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing permission check** in the `getConfiguredNetworks` function of `WifiServiceImpl.java`. This **missing authorization** allows an attacker to determine whether an app is installed without the necessary permissions. The impact is a local escalation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference, points to a **missing authorization** issue. The vulnerability description key phrases mention a \"**missing permission check**\", and the CVE reference content summary confirms the \"**Root Cause:** Missing UID to package name check in `WifiServiceImpl#getConfiguredNetworks`.\"\n\nThe retriever results also highlight CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-862 **Missing Authorization** is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability stems directly from the absence of an authorization check. The CVE summary clearly states that the root cause is a missing UID to package name check in `WifiServiceImpl#getConfiguredNetworks`. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-862, which states, \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\"\n\nCWE-285 **Improper Authorization** was considered but not selected as the primary CWE. While it is a parent of CWE-862, the description explicitly mentions that the product \"does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check.\" Since the vulnerability is specifically about a **missing** check, CWE-862 is a more precise fit.\n\nCWE-732 **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource** was also considered but not selected. While related to permissions, the core issue is not about assigning incorrect permissions, but rather the complete absence of a check to ensure the caller has the required permissions. Therefore, CWE-862 is a more accurate representation of the vulnerability.",
