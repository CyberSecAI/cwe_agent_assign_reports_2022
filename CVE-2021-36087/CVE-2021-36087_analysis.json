The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a \"**heap-based buffer over-read**\", which strongly aligns with CWE-126. The secondary CWE, CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input), is related because the **lack of checks for invalid statements** can lead to the over-read.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe788[\"CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n    cwe1284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe126 primary\n    class cwe1284 secondary\n    class cwe125,cwe788,cwe20 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **lack of checks for invalid statements** (CWE-1284) within an optional block, which then leads to a **heap-based buffer over-read** (CWE-126).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) as the primary candidate due to the explicit mention of \"**heap-based buffer over-read**\" in the vulnerability description. The retriever results also ranked CWE-126 highly. Further analysis of the vulnerability description's root cause (**lack of checks for invalid statements**) suggests that CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is also relevant as a secondary weakness contributing to the vulnerability.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"The CIL compiler in SELinux 3.2 has a **heap-based buffer over-read** in ebitmap_match_any (called indirectly from cil_check_neverallow). This occurs because there is sometimes a **lack of checks for invalid statements** in an optional block.\"\n\nCWE-126 is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a \"**heap-based buffer over-read**\". CWE-126 is a Variant, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\nCWE-1284 is selected as the secondary CWE because the **lack of checks for invalid statements** is a contributing factor to the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) was considered but not selected because it is a Class-level CWE, and CWE-126 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation to determine how much memory to allocate, but an integer overflow can occur that causes less memory to be allocated than expected, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a named chain, which combines multiple weaknesses.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
