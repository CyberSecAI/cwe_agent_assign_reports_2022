Contributing to this are the insecure cookie configurations: CWE-1004, Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag, and CWE-1275, Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute. CWE-1004 and CWE-1275 are variants that contribute to the overall CSRF vulnerability. CWE-1275 can precede CWE-352 in an attack chain.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe1004[\"CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag\"]\n    cwe1275[\"CWE-1275: Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute\"]\n    \n    cwe1004 -->|REQUIRES| cwe352\n    cwe1275 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe352\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe1004,cwe1275 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure** cookie defaults (**missing** `httpOnly` flag and **improper** `SameSite` attribute) and the presence of the CSRF token in the GET query parameter. This leads to the primary vulnerability: CSRF (CWE-352), where an attacker can trick a user into performing unintended actions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-352 as the primary weakness due to the presence of a CSRF token in the GET query parameter and the **insecure** cookie defaults. The retriever results also pointed to CWE-352 as a strong candidate. The evidence explicitly states that the `fastify-csrf` package **did not have the httpOnly flag on cookieOpts** and that **the CSRF token was available in the GET query parameter**. This, combined with the definition of CSRF, makes CWE-352 the most appropriate primary classification.\n\nAdditionally, the absence of the `httpOnly` flag on the cookie (CWE-1004) and the improper `SameSite` attribute (CWE-1275) are contributing factors to the CSRF vulnerability. These are classified as secondary CWEs.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-352 is a compound weakness that accurately represents the overall vulnerability, while CWE-1004 and CWE-1275 are variant-level weaknesses that provide more specific details about the **insecure** cookie configurations. The final classification accurately reflects the root cause and contributing factors to the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
