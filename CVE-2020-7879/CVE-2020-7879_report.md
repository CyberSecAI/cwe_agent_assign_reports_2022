# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2020-7879

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The **lack of validation** on the `setCookie` value allows for command injection via the `--header` option in `wget`. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the selection was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-78 and its parent CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command) and CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Command). While CWE-77 and CWE-74 are broader, CWE-78 directly addresses the specific weakness of OS Command Injection, making it the most accurate choice. The CANALSOBE relationship with CWE-88 (Argument Injection) was considered, but CWE-78 was deemed more precise because the injection directly leads to OS command execution.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the ipTIME NAS sending a `setCookie([COOKIE])` value to the ipTIME C200 IP Camera. The camera then **fails to validate** this cookie value. This unvalidated value is then passed to the `--header` option of the `wget` binary, allowing for **OS command injection** and ultimately leading to **remote command execution**.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified CWE-78 as the primary candidate due to the direct evidence of **OS command injection** via the `wget` binary. The vulnerability description clearly states that the `setCookie` value is transferred to the `--header` option in `wget` without validation, enabling remote attackers to execute commands.

The retriever results also support this, with CWE-78 having the highest score. While other CWEs like CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) were considered, they are either too broad or do not precisely capture the nature of the vulnerability. CWE-20 is a class-level CWE, and CWE-119 typically involves memory corruption issues, which are not explicitly mentioned in the description.

The decision is based on the following evidence from the vulnerability description:

*   "It is necessary to extract value for ipTIME IP camera because the ipTIME NAS send ans setCookie([COOKIE])"
*   "The value is transferred to the --header option in wget binary, and there is **no validation check**."
*   "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to **execute remote command**."

These statements confirm that the **lack of input validation** on the `setCookie` value, combined with its use in the `wget` command, directly leads to OS command injection.

The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately reflects the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper neutralization** of special elements in an OS command.
