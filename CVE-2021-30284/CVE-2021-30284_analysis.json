It also can precede CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime). The secondary CWE considered is CWE-252, which is child of CWE-754, (Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions). This relationship analysis helps to understand the context of the vulnerability and ensure that the selected CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe390[\"CWE-390: Detection of Error Condition Without Action\"]\n    cwe252[\"CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\"]\n    cwe755[\"CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe754[\"CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    \n    cwe390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe755\n    cwe390 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe401\n    cwe252 -->|CHILDOF| cwe754\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe390 primary\n    class cwe252 secondary\n    class cwe755,cwe754,cwe401 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **NAS not dropping messages when integrity check fails**. This can be classified as **CWE-390 (Detection of Error Condition Without Action)**, where the error condition is the failed integrity check, but no action is taken to drop the message. This can then lead to information exposure and denial of service. If the **NAS does not properly handle the failed integrity check**, it could also be due to **CWE-252 (Unchecked Return Value)**, where the return value of the integrity check function is not checked, leading to the message being processed despite the failure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the **rootcause** description: \"**NAS not dropping messages when integrity check fails**\". This directly aligns with **CWE-390 (Detection of Error Condition Without Action)**. The retriever results also listed CWE-390 as a candidate. The graph relationships show that CWE-390 is a child of CWE-755 (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions), which provides broader context. Additionally, the potential for an unchecked return value from the integrity check function suggests **CWE-252 (Unchecked Return Value)** as a secondary contributing factor. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity as they directly address the **rootcause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following

equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6229.10\n**Source**:
