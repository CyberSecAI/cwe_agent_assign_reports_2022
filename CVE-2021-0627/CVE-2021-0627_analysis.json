CWE-190 is a base-level CWE, making it a good fit for the **root cause**. CWE-787 is a consequence of the overflow, leading to **memory corruption**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe119 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe787\n    cwe190 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190), which then leads to **memory corruption**, specifically an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the **root cause** of the vulnerability is an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) that results in **memory corruption** via an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). The description mentions, \"In OMA DRM, there is a possible **memory corruption** due to an **integer overflow**.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this: \"Root cause: Integer overflow in OMA DRM\" and \"Weaknesses: CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound\".\n\nCWE-190 is selected as the primary CWE because it represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability. CWE-787 is included as a secondary CWE because it is the direct consequence of the **integer overflow**, leading to **memory corruption**.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not chosen:\n\n*   CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size): While an **integer overflow** could lead to an incorrect buffer size calculation, the description doesn't explicitly state this. Therefore, it's not as directly supported by the evidence as CWE-190 and CWE-787.\n*   CWE-704 (Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast): This is not the primary issue, although type conversion could be a factor leading to the overflow, the description focuses on the overflow itself.\n*   CWE-191 (Integer Underflow): The description mentions an overflow, not an underflow.\n*   CWE-1260 (Improper Handling of Overlap Between Protected Memory Ranges): This is not directly related to the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-128 (Wrap-around Error): This is closely related to CWE-190, but CWE-190 is more specific to the **integer overflow** condition described.\n*   CWE-662 (Improper Synchronization) and CWE-667 (Improper Locking): These are related to concurrent access and locking, which are not mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource): This is not related to the vulnerability description.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **root cause** (**integer overflow**) and its immediate consequence (**memory corruption** via out-of-bounds write). The evidence strongly supports these classifications, and the relationship analysis helps to understand the chain of events.",
