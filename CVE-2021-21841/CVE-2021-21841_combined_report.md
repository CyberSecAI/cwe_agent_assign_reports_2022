# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.8 | Variant | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)**, which is a base-level CWE. It can lead to **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)**. The integer overflow results in an undersized buffer allocation, which is then exploited by writing more data than the buffer can hold. There is a CanPrecede relationship between CWE-190 and **CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer)** but since it is more specific, CWE-122 is preferred.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with an **unchecked arithmetic** operation leading to an **integer overflow** (CWE-190). This integer overflow results in the allocation of a smaller than expected buffer. Subsequently, writing data into this undersized buffer leads to a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122), causing memory corruption.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference links content summary. The key evidence lies in the **unchecked arithmetic** leading to an **integer overflow**, which directly corresponds to **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)**. The subsequent heap-based buffer overflow is a direct consequence of this integer overflow, making **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)** a relevant secondary CWE. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-190 can precede CWE-119, but given the explicit heap-based overflow, CWE-122 is more specific and appropriate.

The vulnerability description states: "A specially crafted MPEG-4 input when reading an atom using the sbgp FOURCC code can cause an **integer overflow** due to **unchecked arithmetic** resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption." This statement clearly identifies the integer overflow as the root cause and the heap-based buffer overflow as a consequence.

The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-190 accurately represents the integer overflow, and CWE-122 captures the heap-based nature of the buffer overflow. While CWE-119 could be a more general classification, the evidence points to the specific types (integer and heap) of the weaknesses.

CWE-119, **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)**, **CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read)**, **CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error)**, **CWE-197 (Numeric Truncation Error)**, **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)**, and **CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input)** were considered but not chosen as primary CWEs. CWE-119 is too generic. CWE-125 and CWE-126 relate to reading out of bounds, while the vulnerability is a write out of bounds. CWE-193 is an off-by-one error and the provided description doesn't align with that. CWE-197 refers to truncation errors, which is not the root cause here. CWE-787 is more general and out-of-bounds write can happen because of other issues. The description provided does not describe improper validation of input.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-21841:

**Root Cause:** Integer overflow in the `sbgp_box_read` function of the GPAC library when parsing the "sbgp" atom.

**Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Integer Overflow:** When calculating the required memory allocation size for sample group entries, the library multiplies the number of entries (read from the input) by the size of a `GF_SampleGroupEntry`. This multiplication can overflow on 32-bit systems, resulting in a smaller memory buffer than expected.
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** After the undersized buffer is allocated, the function proceeds to read the sample data into this buffer. Since the allocated buffer is smaller than required, the write operation overflows it causing memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Memory Corruption:** The heap-based buffer overflow leads to memory corruption, which can potentially be leveraged by an attacker.
*   **Code Execution:** In a successful exploitation scenario, this memory corruption could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the library.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious MPEG-4 File:** An attacker can craft a malicious MPEG-4 file that contains a "sbgp" atom with a large number of entries, triggering the integer overflow during allocation and subsequent buffer overflow.
*   **User Interaction:** An attacker needs to convince a user to open or process this crafted MPEG-4 file using the vulnerable GPAC library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious MPEG-4 file.
*   The attacker needs to induce a user to process the crafted file with an application using the vulnerable GPAC library.

**Technical Details from the provided content:**
The vulnerability lies within the `sbgp_box_read` function:
1.  The library reads a 32-bit integer representing the number of sample group entries from the atom.
2.  The library checks this number of entries against the atom's 64-bit size, but it's an insufficient check.
3.  The library multiplies the number of entries by the size of a `GF_SampleGroupEntry` structure. This calculation can cause an integer overflow and lead to undersized memory allocation.
4. The function reads two 32-bit integers into the undersized buffer, resulting in memory corruption.

The crash information shows the AddressSanitizer detecting a heap-buffer-overflow when writing into the undersized buffer allocated during processing of the "sbgp" atom in the `sbgp_box_read` function.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Overflow: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
Wraparound: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
wrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of "wraparound"

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with "overflow," "underflow," and "wraparound" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called "underflows").


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.

**[Terminology]** 

"Integer overflow" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.


A "wraparound" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.


"Overflow" is sometimes conflated with "wraparound" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.


The "overflow" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use "overflow" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using "underflow" for exceeding the minimum.


Some people use "overflow" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses "underflow" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.


See [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.


**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.




## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.

### Extended Description
When a primitive is cast to a smaller primitive, the high order bits of the large value are lost in the conversion, potentially resulting in an unexpected value that is not equal to the original value. This value may be required as an index into a buffer, a loop iterator, or simply necessary state data. In any case, the value cannot be trusted and the system will be in an undefined state. While this method may be employed viably to isolate the low bits of a value, this usage is rare, and truncation usually implies that an implementation error has occurred.

- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.




## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read




## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

### Description
Wrap around errors occur whenever a value is incremented past the maximum value for its type and therefore "wraps around" to a very small, negative, or undefined value.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
CanPrecede -> CWE-119
PeerOf -> CWE-190

- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is not always a buffer overflow. For example, an off-by-one error could be a factor in a partial comparison, a read from the wrong memory location, an incorrect conditional, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-0252:** Off-by-one error allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via requests that do not contain newlines.
- **CVE-2001-1391:** Off-by-one vulnerability in driver allows users to modify kernel memory.
- **CVE-2002-0083:** Off-by-one error allows local users or remote malicious servers to gain privileges.




## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-118
ChildOf -> CWE-20

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist
