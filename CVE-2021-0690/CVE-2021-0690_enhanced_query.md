    ## WEAKNESS: 'heap buffer overflow'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 475.05)

A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....

### 2. CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound) (Score: 458.33)

The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result....

### 3. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 445.86)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 4. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 433.89)

The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....

### 5. CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types (Score: 413.44)

When converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur....
