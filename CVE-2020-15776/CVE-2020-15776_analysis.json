CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)) is a compound CWE that represents the broader attack, which relies on the weakness of the **missing HttpOnly flag**. CWE-352 also requires CWE-346 (Origin Validation Error), CWE-441 (Unintended Proxy or Intermediary), CWE-613 (Insufficient Session Expiration), and CWE-642 (External Control of Critical State Data) to be successful.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1004[\"CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect or Incomplete Handling of Data Sent to a Downstream Component\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe346[\"CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\"]\n    cwe441[\"CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary\"]\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n    cwe642[\"CWE-642: External Control of Critical State Data\"]\n    \n    cwe1004 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe346\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe441\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe613\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe642\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1004 primary\n    class cwe352,cwe732,cwe346,cwe441,cwe613,cwe642 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing HttpOnly flag** on the CSRF prevention token cookie (CWE-1004), which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the user's browser. This leads to the ability to impose an arbitrary value for the CSRF token, thus enabling a **cross-site request forgery** attack (CWE-352).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag (CWE-1004)**. The vulnerability description states, \"The CSRF prevention token is stored in a request cookie that is not annotated as HttpOnly.\" This directly matches the description of CWE-1004: \"The product uses a cookie to store sensitive information, but the cookie is not marked with the HttpOnly flag.\" The **cross-site request forgery** (CWE-352) is the result of this **missing flag**.\n\nThe evidence is strong because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **missing HttpOnly flag** and the resulting **cross-site request forgery**. The retriever results also list CWE-1004 as the top combined result.\n\nCWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')), CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)), CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')), and CWE-614 (Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute) were considered, but they do not accurately describe the root cause of this vulnerability. CWE-79 relates to improper neutralization of input, which is not the case here. CWE-918 and CWE-89 are related to server-side request forgery and SQL injection, respectively, which are also not relevant. CWE-614 is about the absence of the Secure attribute, but the reported weakness is about the absence of the HttpOnly attribute.",
