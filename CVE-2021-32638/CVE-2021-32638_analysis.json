This CWE is at the Base level and directly matches the vulnerability where the GitHub token was passed as a **command-line parameter**, making it visible to other processes.\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) and CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer) are related because the **sensitive information** (the GitHub token) is being sent as part of the command-line invocation, and the application **does not properly remove** that information before making it visible.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe214[\"CWE-214: Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe214 -->|CHILDOF| cwe497\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe214\n    cwe212 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe201\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe214 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe212 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause**:\n1.  The CodeQL runner accepts a GitHub token as a **command-line parameter** (**CWE-214**).\n2.  This leads to the **insertion of sensitive information** into the command that is being sent (**CWE-201**).\n3.  The **sensitive information** is **not properly removed** before the process is invoked, leading to its exposure (**CWE-212**).\n4.  The **impact** is the exposure of the GitHub access token.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary finding is CWE-214 because the vulnerability's **root cause** is the passing of the GitHub token as a visible **command-line parameter**. This aligns directly with the CWE's description: \"A process is invoked with **sensitive command-line arguments**, environment variables, or other elements that can be seen by other processes on the operating system.\" The evidence is strong, as the vulnerability description states: \"The runner and its documentation previously suggested passing the GitHub token as a **command-line parameter** to the process instead of reading it from a file, standard input, or an environment variable.\"\n\nCWE-201 and CWE-212 are considered secondary because they describe the subsequent steps in the chain (insertion and lack of removal), but CWE-214 most accurately captures the initial coding error.\n\nThe CWE selection is at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-214 is a Base-level CWE that directly describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability. More general CWEs like CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere), which is a parent of CWE-214, would be less specific and less informative.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), and CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) were considered but not selected because the vulnerability does not directly involve issues with authorization or authentication mechanisms. The problem is the exposure of a valid token, not the failure to authenticate or authorize correctly.",
