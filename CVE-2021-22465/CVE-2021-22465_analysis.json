CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a class-level CWE that is often misused when more specific CWEs are available.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe788[\"CWE-788: Allocation of Memory Without Limits\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe788 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n    class cwe787,cwe788 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **heap-based buffer overflow** (CWE-122) which leads to a kernel system becoming unavailable.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states that the **weakness** is a **heap-based buffer overflow**. This directly maps to CWE-122.\n\nThe evidence is:\n\"A component of the HarmonyOS has a **Heap-based Buffer Overflow** vulnerability. Local attackers may exploit this vulnerability to cause Kernel System unavailable.\"\n\nCWE-122 is the optimal level of specificity because it clearly defines the type of buffer overflow (heap-based) and aligns with the provided vulnerability information. Other CWEs like CWE-119 are too general.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n\nThis CWE was considered but is not appropriate because the description does not provide any information about an incorrect calculation of buffer size.
