It has parent-child relationships with CWE-285 \"Improper Authorization\" and CWE-284 \"Improper Access Control.\" The secondary candidate is CWE-425, \"Direct Request,\" which is a Base-level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper implementation that allows passing shortcode attributes with post_type & post_status**. This leads to **incorrect authorization**, allowing users with Contributor roles to **retrieve arbitrary content** they are not supposed to access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the vulnerability as related to authorization issues within the Improved Include Page WordPress plugin. The plugin **allows passing shortcode attributes with post_type & post_status**, which can be exploited to retrieve arbitrary content. This **incorrect authorization** allows users with Contributor roles or higher to access content they are not supposed to.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863, \"Incorrect Authorization,\" is based on the fact that the product performs an authorization check, but it does not correctly perform the check. This is supported by the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which state that the plugin **allows passing shortcode attributes with post_type & post_status** to retrieve arbitrary content, which demonstrates that authorization is performed but is flawed.\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-863 as the top result, further supporting this choice. The retriever result also lists CWE-425 \"Direct Request\", which is when the application does not adequately enforce authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files. This could occur if the shortcode bypassed authorization checks that would normally be in place for direct access.\n\nCWE-285 \"Improper Authorization\" and CWE-284 \"Improper Access Control\" were considered but not selected because they are higher-level (Class and Pillar, respectively) and less specific than CWE-863. While they broadly apply, CWE-863 accurately captures the **incorrect authorization** mechanism.\n\nCWE-266 \"Incorrect Privilege Assignment\" and CWE-201 \"Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\" were also considered but deemed less relevant. CWE-266 focuses on incorrect assignment of privileges, which isn't the primary issue here. CWE-201 focuses on the exposure of sensitive information, but this vulnerability's primary impact is unauthorized access rather than direct information exposure.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it accurately describes the **incorrect authorization** mechanism that allows unauthorized access to content. The confidence level is high (0.9) due to the clear alignment between the vulnerability description, the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, and the CWE definition.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
