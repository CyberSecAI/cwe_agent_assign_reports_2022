This is related to other release-related CWEs such as CWE-763 Release of Invalid Pointer or Reference (Base) and CWE-590 Free of Memory not on the Heap (Variant). CWE-415 is a child of CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference) and CWE-1341 (Multiple Releases of Same Resource or Handle). The relationships show a clear hierarchy of resource management issues, but CWE-415 is the most specific match given the evidence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe415[\"CWE-415: Double Free\"]\n    cwe763[\"CWE-763: Release of Invalid Pointer or Reference\"]\n    cwe590[\"CWE-590: Free of Memory not on the Heap\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe1341[\"CWE-1341: Multiple Releases of Same Resource or Handle\"]\n    cwe762[\"CWE-762: Mismatched Memory Management Routines\"]\n    \n    cwe415 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe415 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1341\n    cwe590 -->|CHILDOF| cwe762\n    cwe763 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe415 primary\n    class cwe763,cwe590 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of duplicate union data** and **incomplete data during deserialization**. This leads to **incorrect destructor calls** and ultimately results in an **invalid free**, which causes a crash or potential code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the **invalid free** as the root cause. The retriever results provided several candidate CWEs, but CWE-415 Double Free aligns best with the description. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions scenarios that can lead to incorrect destructor calls and memory corruption, directly supporting the double free condition.\n\nThe description states: \"An **invalid free** in Thrifts table-based serialization can cause the application to crash or potentially result in code execution or other undesirable effects.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"Specifically, when the input data contained multiple entries for the same union, the previous active member was overwritten without properly calling its destructor, which could lead to a memory leak and potentially other issues. Additionally, incomplete data during the deserialization process could lead to incorrect destructors being called during stack unwinding, resulting in a segfault, data corruption, or other undesirable effects.\"\n\nTherefore, CWE-415 is the most appropriate and specific mapping based on the available evidence. It is a variant level CWE which is preferred.\n\nCWE-763 (Release of Invalid Pointer or Reference) was considered because the vulnerability involves an **invalid free**. However, the evidence points more specifically to a double free situation (CWE-415) rather than a generic invalid pointer release.\n\nCWE-590 (Free of Memory not on the Heap) was considered because the memory being freed might not have been allocated on the heap. However, the primary issue is the double freeing of the *same* memory location, making CWE-415 a better fit.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
