CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-618 is a Variant. The other CWEs listed are either too broad (CWE-20) or focus on specific types of errors (e.g., buffer overflows). The Mermaid diagram visualizes this relationship.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe618[\"CWE-618: Exposed Unsafe ActiveX Method\"]\n    \n    cwe618 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe618 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an exposed unsafe ActiveX method (CWE-618) which is then leveraged by an attacker to disclose sensitive information (CWE-200), specifically NTLMv2 credentials.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the primary CWE match was listed as CWE-416 (Use After Free) from similar CVE Descriptions. However, based on the provided information and the Retriever Results, the vulnerability is primarily an exposure of sensitive information (NTLMv2 credentials) due to an unsafe ActiveX method.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states \"An unauthenticated attacker could leverage this vulnerability to obtain NTLMv2 credentials,\" which directly relates to the exposure of sensitive information. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section also mentions \"Information Exposure\" as the root cause.\n\nGiven that the ActiveX control is the component enabling the exposure, CWE-618 is chosen as a secondary CWE to provide a more granular view of the weakness.\n\nWhile CWE-200 is generally discouraged as it is a Class-level CWE, in this case, the root cause is directly related to the exposure of sensitive information, making it a relevant, albeit broad, classification. The use of CWE-618 provides a more specific weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Why Not Used**: There is no evidence of improper validation in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Why Not Used**: There is no evidence of relying on untrusted inputs for security decisions.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive -
