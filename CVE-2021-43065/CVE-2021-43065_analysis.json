It is related to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) through ChildOf relationships. The mapping guidance suggests reviewing the specific mistake that allows the resource to be exposed and performing a CWE mapping for that mistake. CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a Class-level CWE and is a candidate due to the credentials being stored in cleartext.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe668,cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Incorrect Permission Assignment** (CWE-732) on the `tomcat-users.xml` file.\n2.  **Weakness:** Sensitive information (login and password) stored in cleartext within the misconfigured file.\n3.  **Impact:** An attacker with an unprivileged user account and SSH access can read the file, gain access to the FortiNAC Configuration Wizard, and escalate privileges.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the provided evidence, points to **CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource)** as the primary weakness. The \"Vulnerability Description\" mentions an **incorrect permission assignment**, and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" details that improper file permissions were set for the `tomcat-users.xml` file, which contained login credentials in cleartext. The attacker needs only an unprivileged account and SSH access to read the file and escalate privileges. This aligns with the description of CWE-732, where a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, leading to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nThe relationship analysis highlights that CWE-732 is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere). However, CWE-732 is more specific and directly addresses the **incorrect permission assignment** on a critical resource.\n\nCWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) was also considered due to the sensitive information being stored in cleartext. However, the root cause is the **incorrect permission assignment** that allowed unauthorized access to the file in the first place. Therefore, CWE-522 is considered a secondary contributing factor.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-732 is based on the explicit evidence of **incorrect permission assignment** on the `tomcat-users.xml` file, leading to privilege escalation. This aligns perfectly with the CWE-732 description and its intended usage. The level of specificity is appropriate as it captures the precise nature of the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
