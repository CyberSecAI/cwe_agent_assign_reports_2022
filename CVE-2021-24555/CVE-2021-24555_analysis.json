The secondary CWEs, CWE-352 and CWE-862, represent the **lack of CSRF protection** and **missing authorization** checks respectively. These weaknesses are related in that the lack of CSRF protection and authorization allows an attacker to exploit the **SQL Injection** vulnerability more easily.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|REQUIRES| cwe352\n    cwe89 -->|REQUIRES| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe352,cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper sanitization, validation or escaping** of the `id` POST parameter. This leads to **SQL Injection** (CWE-89). The **lack of CSRF protection** (CWE-352) and **missing authorization** (CWE-862) allow an authenticated user to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the analysis identified the **SQL Injection** vulnerability due to the **lack of proper sanitisation, validation or escaping**. The analysis was enhanced by considering the related weaknesses of **missing CSRF protection** and **missing authorization**. These additional weaknesses increase the exploitability of the **SQL Injection** vulnerability. The final assessment is based on the provided evidence which includes vulnerability description key phrases, CVE reference links content summary, and retriever results.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description includes:\n- \"**rootcause:** **lack of proper sanitisation, validation or escaping**\"\n- \"**weakness:** **SQL injection**\"\n- \"Furthermore, the ajax action is **lacking any CSRF** and capability check, making it available to any authenticated user.\"\n\nThe retriever results also support the selection of CWE-89 as the primary CWE.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the dependencies between the different weaknesses.\n\nCWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly describes the **SQL Injection** vulnerability. CWE-352 and CWE-862 are included as secondary CWEs because they are related to the exploitability of the **SQL Injection** vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
