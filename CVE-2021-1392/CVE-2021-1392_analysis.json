This is a child of CWE-284, Improper Access Control, which is a pillar level CWE. CWE-732 is the more specific and appropriate choice. CWE-522, Insufficiently Protected Credentials, is a class level CWE which is a child of CWE-287, Weak Authentication, and CWE-668, Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n    class cwe284,cwe287,cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect permissions** assigned to the `show cip security` CLI command, which leads to an attacker being able to retrieve the password for the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP). This then leads to the attacker being able to remotely configure the device as an administrative user.\nCWE-732 --> Information Disclosure (CIP password) --> Privilege Escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **incorrect permissions** as the root cause. The key phrase \"incorrect permissions\" in the vulnerability description, along with the summary in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary section, support this.\nThe vulnerability description states: \"This vulnerability exists because **incorrect permissions** are associated with the show cip security CLI command.\" This statement explicitly links the root cause to **incorrect permissions**.\nBased on this and the retriever results, the primary CWE selected is CWE-732, Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource. This is the most specific CWE that accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability. Other CWEs were considered but deemed less appropriate. CWE-522 was considered as a secondary CWE because the impact of the vulnerability is the disclosure of credentials, but the root cause is the **incorrect permissions**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
