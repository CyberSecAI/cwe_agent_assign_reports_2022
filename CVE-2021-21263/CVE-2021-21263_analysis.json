The vulnerability allows for the manipulation of SQL queries through improper input validation, potentially leading to SQL injection. |\n| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The root cause of the vulnerability is the improper validation of the input, which allows an attacker to inject an array into a field expecting a non-array value. |\n| CWE-943 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic | 0.5 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability involves generating a query without properly neutralizing special elements that can modify the query's logic. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE, CWE-89, is a child of CWE-943, indicating a more specific type of data query issue. CWE-1284 can precede CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value), which is not directly relevant here but highlights the potential for resource-related impacts from improper input validation. The hierarchical relationship between CWE-89 and CWE-943 helps refine the classification to a potential SQL injection issue arising from the broader category of improper data query neutralization. The Base level of CWE-89 and CWE-1284 is preferred for root cause mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe89\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe943,cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of root cause and weaknesses that followed for the Vulnerability Description.\n  - The vulnerability begins with **improper input validation** (CWE-1284), where the system **fails to validate that a field is not an array when it should be**\n  - Because of this **missing validation** the attacker can manipulate the query bindings\n  - This leads to **improper neutralization of special elements in data query logic** (CWE-943)\n  - Which can result in **SQL injection** (CWE-89) and the query returning unexpected results.\n  - The final impact is the return of **unexpected results**, which could lead to further exploitation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the possibility of SQL injection due to the **query binding exploitation**. The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" strongly supports this, stating that the **root cause** is the framework's **failure to properly validate or cast input types**, which can allow an attacker to control the structure of the SQL query. The description mentions that the impact could be queries returning no results or, more seriously, returning unexpected results or potentially, arbitrary SQL injection.\n\nThe \"Retriever Results\" listed CWE-89, CWE-1284 and CWE-943 as potential matches, with CWE-89 being the top result. Given the potential for SQL injection and the **improper input validation**, CWE-89 is selected as the primary CWE. CWE-1284 is a secondary CWE as the **improper validation** is the root cause. CWE-943 is also a secondary CWE since it describes the **improper neutralization** issue.\n\nThe hierarchical relationships show that CWE-89 is a child of CWE-943, making it a more specific classification. The chain relationship with CWE-1284 highlights how **improper input validation** can lead to this type of vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is justified by the evidence of **query binding exploitation** potentially leading to SQL injection, and is at the optimal level of specificity as a Base CWE. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section provides the best evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected*: Not directly related to the SQL injection or input validation issue.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
