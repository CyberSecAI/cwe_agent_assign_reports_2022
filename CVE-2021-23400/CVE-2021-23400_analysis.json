CWE-113 is a variant of CWE-93, specifically focusing on HTTP headers, making it a relevant secondary classification. CWE-74 is a higher-level class describing injection in general and is a parent of CWE-93.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    cwe93 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe93 primary\n    class cwe113,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper sanitization** of user input, specifically the failure to neutralize CRLF sequences. This leads to the ability to inject arbitrary HTTP headers, potentially leading to email spoofing or manipulation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-93 because the vulnerability stems from the **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences**. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **HTTP Header Injection** due to unsanitized user input containing newlines and carriage returns. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms this, stating that the root cause is the \"lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input\" and the ability to inject arbitrary HTTP headers due to newline characters not being removed. The provided PoC demonstrates how an attacker can inject headers by including newline characters in the address field.\n\nCWE-113 is included as a secondary CWE because it is a more specific variant of CWE-93 that focuses on HTTP headers. Since the vulnerability is in the context of email headers, CWE-113 provides additional context.\n\nCWE-74 was considered because it is a high-level class encompassing injection vulnerabilities. However, it was deemed less specific than CWE-93 and CWE-113, as the vulnerability is directly related to CRLF injection rather than a general injection issue. The mapping guidance for CWE-74 also discourages its use when more specific weaknesses are available.\n\nThe final selection emphasizes the specific root cause (**CRLF Injection**) and its manifestation in HTTP headers.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
