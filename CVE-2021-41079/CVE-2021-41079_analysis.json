CWE-20 is included as a secondary weakness because the root cause involves **improper validation** of TLS packets. It is a Class level CWE and is the parent of several more specific CWEs. The decision to include both reflects that the **improper validation** leads to an infinite loop.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe835[\"CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Improper Control of Flow\"]\n\n    cwe835 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe835 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n    class cwe834 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper validation** of TLS packets (CWE-20). This leads to a state where a specially crafted packet can trigger an infinite loop (CWE-835), resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-835 as the primary weakness due to the infinite loop condition. The analysis was refined to include CWE-20, reflecting the underlying **improper input validation** of TLS packets that allows the crafted packet to trigger the loop.\n\nThe evidence for this assessment is drawn directly from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which states that \"Apache Tomcat did not properly validate incoming TLS packets\" and that successful exploitation \"can lead to a denial of service (DoS) by triggering an infinite loop.\" The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section also supports this, indicating \"denial of service\" as the impact and \"specially crafted packet\" as the vector.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the connection between **improper validation** and control flow issues. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-835 directly describes the infinite loop, and CWE-20 captures the **improper input validation** aspect. Using a more specific child of CWE-20 may not fully represent the overall vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
