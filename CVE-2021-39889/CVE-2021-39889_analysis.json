It is a child of CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), highlighting the authorization context of the vulnerability. CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is a child of CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information) and can also be related to CWE-202 and CWE-209, indicating the information leakage aspect.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe202[\"CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe201 -- CANALSOBE --> cwe202\n    cwe201 -- CANALSOBE --> cwe209\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n    class cwe863,cwe284,cwe200,cwe202,cwe209 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure direct object reference**, which leads to an authorization bypass and ultimately results in the exposure of the protected branch name.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Insecure Direct Object Reference** (CWE-639) due to **insufficient input validation**.\n  - **Weakness:** Authorization bypass due to user-controlled key.\n  - **Impact:** Reveal protected branch name (CWE-201).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **insecure direct object reference** as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description key phrases and the CVE reference content summary. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-639 as the top candidate.\n\nThe analysis of CWE relationships confirmed that CWE-639 is a base-level CWE related to authorization bypass, making it an appropriate fit. CWE-201 was considered as a secondary weakness because the ultimate impact is the disclosure of sensitive information.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference. The selection of CWE-639 as the primary CWE is based on the root cause being an **insecure direct object reference**, allowing an attacker to bypass authorization checks.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6362.60\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**\n- **Technical Explanation:** The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly validate user-supplied input (`protected_branch_ids`) when setting up status checks for merge requests. This **lack of validation** allows an attacker to manipulate the `protected_branch_ids` parameter in the API request, specifying arbitrary branch IDs, even those belonging to private projects. The application then returns the branch name in the response, effectively bypassing authorization and disclosing the name of the protected branch.\n- **Security Implications:** An attacker can obtain the names of protected branches from private projects that they do not have access to. This information disclosure can be used to further target those projects.\n- **Relationship:** CWE-639 is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), placing it within the authorization context.\n- **Mapping Guidance:** The MITRE mapping guidance allows the use of CWE-639, as it is at the base level of abstraction.\n- **Usage:** Primary\n\n**CWE-201 Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data**\n- **Technical Explanation:** While the root cause is the authorization bypass, the ultimate impact is the exposure of sensitive information (the protected branch name) to an unauthorized actor.
