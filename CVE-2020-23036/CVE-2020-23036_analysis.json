CWE-522 is a broader classification related to **insufficiently protected credentials**, which is relevant since the credentials are being sent in the clear. CWE-294 becomes relevant because **cleartext transmission** allows for **capture-replay attacks**. CWE-319 is a child of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data), highlighting the lack of encryption as the root cause. CWE-522 is a class-level CWE and has more specific base-level children that could be considered.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe294[\"CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe294 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe319 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe294\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe294 secondary\n    class cwe311,cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure session validation** that leads to the transmission of the password in **cleartext**. This **cleartext transmission** makes it easy to intercept the credentials using a man-in-the-middle attack. The intercepted credentials can then be replayed to bypass authentication.\n  - Insecure Session Validation -> **Cleartext Transmission** (CWE-319) -> Interception of Credentials -> Authentication Bypass by Capture-Replay (CWE-294)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **cleartext transmission of sensitive information** (CWE-319). The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links clearly indicates that the password parameter is being sent in plain text over HTTP.\n> Vulnerability Description: \"...**insecure session validation** vulnerability in the session handling of the `password` authentication parameter...This vulnerability allows attackers...to read the authentication credentials...via a man in the middle attack.\"\n> CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"Plain-text transmission of authentication credentials (password) over HTTP.\"\n\nThis aligns with CWE-319's description: \"The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\"\n\nCWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a relevant secondary consideration because the credentials are not adequately protected during transmission. However, CWE-319 is more specific to the **cleartext transmission** itself, making it a better primary choice.\n\nCWE-294 (Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay) is also a relevant secondary consideration as **cleartext transmission** makes capture and replay possible.\n\nThe final CWE selection is based on direct evidence, supporting relationships, and adherence to mapping guidance, favoring the most specific and descriptive CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
