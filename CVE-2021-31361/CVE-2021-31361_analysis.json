CWE-755 is also a class level and is discouraged.

The **Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions** (CWE-754) leads to\n2.  The **Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions** (CWE-755) and results in\n3.  A partial Denial of Service (DoS)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified two key weaknesses: **Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions** and **Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions**. The vulnerability description clearly states these weaknesses as the root causes of the issue.\n\nThe evidence is strong, as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions both **Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions** and **Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions** as the root causes.\n\nCWE-754 is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability involves the product failing to adequately check for unusual or exceptional conditions. CWE-755 is included as a secondary CWE as the product also fails to properly handle these exceptional conditions.\n\nThe selection of these CWEs is at an appropriate level of specificity. While more specific CWEs might exist, the provided information does not offer enough detail to warrant mapping to a base or variant level CWE. Both CWE-754 and CWE-755 are class level CWEs.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-754 and CWE-755.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
