CWE-613 can also precede CWE-287 **Improper Authentication**. This relationship suggests that insufficient session expiration can lead to authentication bypass. Given that the vulnerability description focuses on the **unexpiring refresh token** and its direct impact on maintaining authentication, CWE-613 is the more fitting choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource After Expiration or Release\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe613 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe613 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe613 primary\n    class cwe672,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause**: the application **fails to expire refresh tokens**. This leads to the weakness: **unexpiring refresh tokens**. The impact is **persistent access** and potential **account takeover**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **unexpiring refresh token** as the primary vulnerability.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states, \"This flaw allows an attacker to **obtain a refresh token that does not expire**,\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that \"the refresh tokens do not adhere to the expiration time specified by the `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_SECONDS` setting.\" This directly relates to **CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration**.\n\nCWE-287 **Improper Authentication** was considered because the **unexpiring token** allows persistent access, effectively bypassing the intended authentication process. However, CWE-287 is discouraged by MITRE when more specific CWEs are applicable. Since the root cause is the **lack of session expiration** rather than a flaw in the authentication mechanism itself, CWE-613 is more appropriate.\n\nThe relationship analysis further supports this decision. CWE-613 is a child of CWE-672, indicating a more specific type of resource expiration issue. The chain relationship also suggests that insufficient session expiration can lead to authentication bypass, but the primary issue is the **unexpiring token**.\n\nTherefore, CWE-613 is the optimal level of specificity and accurately represents the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
