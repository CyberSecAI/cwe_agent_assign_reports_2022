This is a base-level CWE, indicating a specific weakness. It can **precede** CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value). The vulnerability involves **missing bounds checks**, which directly relates to failing to validate a quantity.\n\nCWE-770 is a child of CWE-400, indicating that allocating resources without limits can lead to resource exhaustion. Although the vulnerability description mentions a denial-of-service, which is often a result of resource exhaustion, the root cause is the **missing bounds checks**. Therefore, CWE-1284 precedes CWE-770 which leads to CWE-400.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1284 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing bounds checks** (CWE-1284), which allows for an excessive quantity to be specified. This leads to allocating resources without limits or throttling (CWE-770), eventually resulting in uncontrolled resource consumption and denial of service (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description highlighting the **missing bounds checks** on UI settings, which can lead to a permanent denial of service. The commit message `[SettingsProvider] fix font size scale validator` and the bug ID `BUG: 156260178` further supports the notion of **improper input validation** related to a quantity (font size scale).\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by emphasizing the progression from improper input validation to resource exhaustion. CWE-1284 is the most specific and accurate representation of the root cause, as it directly addresses the **missing validation of the specified quantity**. The other CWE candidates, such as CWE-770 and CWE-400, represent the consequences of this root cause.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE was considered, but it is more relevant when the input is used as a resource identifier and compared to an unsafe value. The provided vulnerability is a **missing bounds check** on UI settings which is better described by CWE-1284.\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\nCWE-754 is too general. The vulnerability is about **missing bounds checks** on input, which is more specific than just unusual or exceptional conditions.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\nThis CWE is about releasing resources, which is not relevant to the **missing bounds checks** vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-606: Unchecked Input for Loop Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE is similar to CWE-1284, but it's specific to loop conditions. The vulnerability isn't explicitly about loop conditions, so CWE-1284 is a better fit.\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\nThis CWE is too abstract and doesn't capture the specific nature of the **missing bounds checks** vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\nThis CWE is about improper locking, which is not related to the **missing bounds checks** vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE is about relying on untrusted inputs for security decisions.
