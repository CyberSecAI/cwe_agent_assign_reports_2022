Its children, CWE-276 and CWE-277, were considered as more specific options. CWE-276 represents incorrect default permissions, while CWE-277 represents insecure inherited permissions. While the description states \"**Insecure File Permissions** exist in Aviatrix Controller\", it lacks the specifics to definitively classify it as either a default permission issue or an inherited permission issue. Since the evidence is not specific enough, a more general Class-level CWE-732 is selected.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe276[\"CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\"]\n    cwe277[\"CWE-277: Insecure Inherited Permissions\"]\n\n    cwe276 -->|ChildOf| cwe732\n    cwe277 -->|ChildOf| cwe732\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe276,cwe277 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the root cause, which is the **Insecure File Permissions**. The consequence is that unauthorized actors might be able to read or modify critical resources, potentially leading to information disclosure or unauthorized modification of the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the \"**Insecure File Permissions**\" in Aviatrix Controller 5.3.1516 indicated a permissions-related issue. The retriever results pointed to CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) as the top candidate. Further investigation revealed that CWE-732 is a Class-level CWE, and more specific Base or Variant level CWEs might be more appropriate. CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions) and CWE-277 (Insecure Inherited Permissions) were considered.\n\nThe vulnerability description provided insufficient information to definitively determine whether the **insecure permissions** were due to incorrect defaults or inherited settings. Therefore, to balance specificity with available evidence, the Class-level CWE-732 was chosen as the primary CWE, with CWE-276 and CWE-277 as secondary candidates that could apply with more information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product searches for critical resources using an externally-supplied search path that can point to resources that are not under the product's direct control.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
