# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2020-27568

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CWE-732** | Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource | 0.9 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |
| CWE-276 | Incorrect Default Permissions | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-277 | Insecure Inherited Permissions | 0.6 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE identified is CWE-732, which is a Class-level CWE. Its children, CWE-276 and CWE-277, were considered as more specific options. CWE-276 represents incorrect default permissions, while CWE-277 represents insecure inherited permissions. While the description states "**Insecure File Permissions** exist in Aviatrix Controller", it lacks the specifics to definitively classify it as either a default permission issue or an inherited permission issue. Since the evidence is not specific enough, a more general Class-level CWE-732 is selected.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the root cause, which is the **Insecure File Permissions**. The consequence is that unauthorized actors might be able to read or modify critical resources, potentially leading to information disclosure or unauthorized modification of the system.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, the "**Insecure File Permissions**" in Aviatrix Controller 5.3.1516 indicated a permissions-related issue. The retriever results pointed to CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) as the top candidate. Further investigation revealed that CWE-732 is a Class-level CWE, and more specific Base or Variant level CWEs might be more appropriate. CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions) and CWE-277 (Insecure Inherited Permissions) were considered.

The vulnerability description provided insufficient information to definitively determine whether the **insecure permissions** were due to incorrect defaults or inherited settings. Therefore, to balance specificity with available evidence, the Class-level CWE-732 was chosen as the primary CWE, with CWE-276 and CWE-277 as secondary candidates that could apply with more information.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.82
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product searches for critical resources using an externally-supplied search path that can point to resources that are not under the product's direct control.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as "/abs/path" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-24: Path Traversal: '../filedir'
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize "../" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6983.47
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
