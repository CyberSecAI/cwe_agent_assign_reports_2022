While more specific CWEs might exist, the information provided does not allow for a more specific mapping. CWE-863 is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), indicating a broader category. CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is also a child of CWE-284 and represents a closely related weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability involves an unauthenticated attacker tampering with the micro-service API.\n\n*   The root cause is a **lack of proper authentication or authorization checks.**\n*   The weakness allowed an attacker to **tamper with the micro-service API.**\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a potential **incorrect authorization** issue (CWE-863) where an unauthenticated attacker can **tamper with the micro-service API**.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that an \"unauthenticated attacker\" can **tamper with the micro-service API**. This suggests either a missing authentication check or an **incorrect authorization** mechanism, leading to unauthorized access and modification of the API.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is selected as the primary CWE because the attacker is able to **tamper** with the API, implying that the existing authorization mechanism is not functioning correctly.\n\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is considered as a secondary CWE because the attacker is \"unauthenticated,\" which suggests a potential **lack of authentication**. However, since the vulnerability description focuses on the ability to **tamper** with the API, **incorrect authorization** is deemed more relevant.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is at the Class level because there isn't enough information to determine the specific type of **incorrect authorization**. More detailed information would be needed to refine the classification to a Base or Variant level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
