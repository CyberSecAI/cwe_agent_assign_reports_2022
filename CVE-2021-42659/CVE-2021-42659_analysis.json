CWE-120 is a potential parent CWE, but the description does not give enough information to know if a buffer copy is the mechanism. CWE-119 is a higher-level class that represents the general category. The relationships influenced the decision to prefer the more specific Variant, CWE-121, which is a child of CWE-119.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe120,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a lack of input validation leading to a **buffer overflow** when handling a \"super-long list parameter,\" resulting in a crash of the httpd program.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified a **buffer overflow** vulnerability. After analyzing the provided information, including the vulnerability description and CVE reference, it's evident that the **buffer overflow** occurs on the stack. The vulnerability lies in the `formSetVirtualSer` function, where the `sscanf` function is used without proper input validation on the `list` parameter, leading to a stack corruption and crash.\n\nThe evidence for this decision is based on:\n\n*   The **Vulnerability Description**, which states, \"There is a **buffer overflow** vulnerability in the Web server httpd of the router in Tenda router devices such as Tenda AC9 V1.0 V15.03.02.19(6318) and Tenda AC9 V3.0 V15.03.06.42_multi. When setting the virtual service, the httpd program will crash and exit when the super-long list parameter occurs.\"\n*   The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**, which indicates the **root cause** is a lack of input validation on the length of the `list` parameter, allowing an attacker to provide a long string, overflowing the buffers `v15, v13, v11, and v9`.\n*   The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**, which also states that the **buffer overflow** corrupts the stack.\n\nThe relationships in the graph reinforce that CWE-121 is a specific instance of a **buffer overflow** that occurs on the stack. The selection is based on the provided evidence and aims for the most specific CWE that accurately describes the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was considered but is not a good fit because the vulnerability is a buffer overflow, not an integer underflow.*\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was considered but is not a good fit because the description indicates that the buffer overflow is caused by a lack of input validation, not an incorrect calculation of the buffer size.*\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was considered but is not a good fit because the vulnerability is a buffer overflow (overwrite), not an underwrite.*\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was considered but is not a good fit because the description indicates the overflow is caused by missing validation of the input length.*\n\n## CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation to determine how much memory to allocate, but an integer overflow can occur that causes less memory to be allocated than expected, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a named chain, which combines multiple weaknesses.\n\n*This CWE was considered but is not a good fit because the vulnerability is due to lack of input validation, not an integer overflow leading to an incorrect buffer size.*\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was considered but is not a good fit because the vulnerability is a buffer overflow (overwrite), not an over-read.*\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was considered but is not a good fit because the vulnerability is a buffer overflow, not an off-by-one error.*\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was considered but is not a good fit because the vulnerability is a buffer overflow (overwrite), not an out-of-bounds read.*\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**:
