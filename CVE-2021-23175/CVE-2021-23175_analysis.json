CWE-639 **Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key** is also a child of CWE-863, but it is more specific and requires a user-controlled key to bypass authorization, which isn't explicitly stated in the vulnerability description but is a plausible scenario. Choosing CWE-863 strikes a balance between specificity and the available evidence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect application of user access controls** (CWE-863). This leads to potential escalation of privileges, information disclosure, data tampering, and denial of service. The root cause is the **failure to correctly apply individual user access controls**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis and resulting conclusion are based heavily on the provided evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference. The vulnerability stems from NVIDIA GeForce Experience failing to correctly apply user access controls within GameStream.\n\nThe key phrase \"GameStream **does not correctly apply individual user access controls** for users on the same device\" directly points to an authorization issue.\n\nThe retriever results listed CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** as the top match, and the description of CWE-863 aligns well with the vulnerability description: \"The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\"\n\nCWE-285 **Improper Authorization** is a parent of CWE-863, but CWE-863 is more specific. CWE-639 **Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key** is more specific, but the description doesn't have the specificity that a user controlled key is present.\n\nThe chosen CWE, CWE-863, is at the Class level, which requires review. The reason why it is appropriate is that a more specific Base level CWE was not explicitly mentioned in the description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
