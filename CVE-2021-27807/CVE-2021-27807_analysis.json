CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) is a Class level CWE and is also a child of CWE-834.

CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) is also listed, but CWE-835 is more specific to the described vulnerability. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a Class level CWE and is too general.\n\nBased on the evidence and the MITRE mapping guidance, CWE-835 is the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion - While recursion *could* be involved in creating the loop, the description focuses on the loop itself. Thus, CWE-835 is a better fit.\n*   CWE-20: Improper Input Validation - This is a very general CWE, and while the crafted PDF file *is* a form of invalid input, the core weakness is the resulting infinite loop.\n*   CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound - There is no evidence provided that an Integer Overflow is the rootcause of the infinite loop.\n*   CWE-834: Excessive Iteration - While related, CWE-835 is a child of CWE-834 and is a more specific description of the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-1339: Insufficient Precision or Accuracy of a Real Number - There is no evidence of floating point numbers or real numbers being involved in this case.\n*   CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - This is completely unrelated to the described vulnerability.",
