The vulnerability description and CVE reference link content summary explicitly state a heap buffer overflow due to writing outside the intended buffer. |\n| CWE-193 | Off-by-one Error | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The root cause is described as a \"float rounding results in off-by-one error\" when accessing image elements, contributing to the out-of-bounds write. |\n| CWE-190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability description involves calculations related to image resizing, and the CVE reference link content summary mentions the potential for integer overflow. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), which is caused by CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error) stemming from floating-point rounding issues. CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) is potentially involved due to calculations, but its involvement is less direct.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe193[\"CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\"]\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe193 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe193,cwe190 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **float rounding resulting in an off-by-one error** (CWE-193), which leads to incorrect memory access calculations, potentially involving integer overflow (CWE-190), and finally resulting in a **heap buffer overflow** (CWE-787).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **heap buffer overflow** and the **off-by-one error**. The CVE reference link content summary strongly supports the heap buffer overflow due to floating-point rounding issues leading to out-of-bounds memory access.\n\nThe vulnerability description states, \"An attacker can trigger a **heap buffer overflow** in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedResizeBilinear` by manipulating input values so that **float rounding results in off-by-one error** in accessing image elements.\" This explicitly links the root cause (off-by-one error) to the weakness (heap buffer overflow).\n\nThe relationship graph shows how these CWEs are connected, with CWE-193 and potentially CWE-190 leading to CWE-787. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately describe the root cause and the resulting vulnerability, aligning with the evidence provided.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
