Its parent is CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure). CWE-345 was selected because the vulnerability involves a **lack of verification of data authenticity**. The secondary CWE considered is CWE-400, which is also a Class-level CWE. It represents the impact of the vulnerability, specifically a denial of service through uncontrolled resource consumption. The relationship between these CWEs is that CWE-345 can lead to CWE-400 if the **unauthenticated data** is used to consume excessive resources.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n\n    cwe345 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe345 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe345 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe693 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient verification of data authenticity** (CWE-345). Because the Luca server does not properly validate data from the client side, an attacker can inject fake records. This leads to the **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400), resulting in a denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description indicates that the Luca server through 1.1.14 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service because Phone Number data lacks a digital signature. The root cause is the **lack of proper validation of client-side data**, which can be manipulated to insert fake records. This aligns with the description of CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity), which states that \"The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this: \"The application relies on client-side storage (indexedDB) to store user information and does not properly validate this data upon check-in.\" This is direct evidence supporting the selection of CWE-345.\n\nThe impact of the vulnerability, a denial of service, suggests CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption). However, CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE and the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. In this case, the root cause is the **lack of data authenticity verification**, which directly enables the uncontrolled resource consumption. Therefore, CWE-345 is the primary CWE, and CWE-400 is a secondary CWE representing the impact.\n\nThe final decision is based on prioritizing the root cause (CWE-345) over the impact (CWE-400), aligning with the MITRE mapping guidance to select the most specific CWE available.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
