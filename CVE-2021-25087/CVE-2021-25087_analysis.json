CWE-425, **Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')**, and CWE-306, **Missing Authentication for Critical Function**, are Base-level CWEs and children of higher-level authorization and authentication CWEs. The vulnerability description indicates a **missing authorisation check** in REST API endpoints, making CWE-862 the most direct fit. CWE-425 is related, as it describes a situation where authorization is not adequately enforced. CWE-306 applies when there is no authentication for a critical function.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe425,cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorisation checks** in the REST API endpoints. This leads directly to **sensitive information disclosure**, including post passwords and file master keys. The chain can be summarized as:\n  - **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862) -> **Sensitive Information Disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** due to the explicit mention of **missing authorisation checks** in the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The retriever results also listed CWE-862 as the top candidate. While CWE-425, **Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')**, and CWE-306, **Missing Authentication for Critical Function**, were also considered, they are less specific than CWE-862.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states that the Download Manager WordPress plugin before 3.2.35 does not have any **authorisation checks** in some of the REST API endpoints, allowing unauthenticated attackers to call them, which could lead to **sensitive information disclosure**.\n\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary further supports this: \"The WordPress Download Manager plugin has **insufficient authorization checks** in some of its REST API endpoints.\"\n\nTherefore, CWE-862 is the most appropriate and specific CWE to represent the root cause of this vulnerability. The selection of CWE-862 is further justified by its \"Allowed-with-Review\" mapping guidance, which suggests examining children of this entry to see if there is a better fit. In this case, the available child CWEs are not as directly applicable as CWE-862 itself. CWE-425 and CWE-306 capture other aspects.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n##
