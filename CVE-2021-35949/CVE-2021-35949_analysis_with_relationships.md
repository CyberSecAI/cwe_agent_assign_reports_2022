# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2021-35949

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-424 | Improper Protection of Alternate Path | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | None |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-863, which is a Class-level CWE. It has a parent, CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), both of which are higher-level abstractions. The alternate CWE is CWE-424 which is a Base level CWE. Choosing CWE-863 over CWE-285 is a decision based on specificity.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with an **improper protection** of an alternate path, leading to **incorrect authorization**, and finally resulting in the **bypass of permission checks** and listing of metadata.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, I considered CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization). However, the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly indicate that the application *attempts* to perform authorization, but does so incorrectly. Therefore, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a more accurate classification than CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). CWE-285 is too high of an abstraction level.

The `shareinfo` controller **fails to properly check permissions**, allowing unauthorized access to metadata. This aligns with the description of CWE-863: "The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states the "**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the permission check for file drop functionality (upload-only shares). The `shareinfo` API could be used to bypass the intended permission checks."

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also states "**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper protection of alternate path (CWE-424). The `shareinfo` API did not enforce the upload-only restrictions of file drops."

Based on the evidence, CWE-863 is the primary weakness, and CWE-424 is a secondary weakness.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.



## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges 
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product violates well-established principles for secure design.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 5325.44
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
