While CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a broader class, CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) provides a more specific description that aligns with the vulnerability. The relationship between CWE-200 and CWE-668 was also considered; however, CWE-200 is discouraged for direct mapping unless the core issue is explicit information exposure, which isn't the primary issue here.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper authorization**, leading to **unauthorized access** and culminating in **exposure of sensitive information** and **unauthorized control** of resources.\n  - Initial Flaw: **Improper Authorization** checks\n  - Resulting Access: **Bypassing Authorization** by manipulating keys\n  - Final Impact: **Exposure of Sensitive Information** and **Unauthorized Control**\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed to a combination of authorization and information exposure issues. The core of the vulnerability lies in the ability of authenticated users to bypass authorization checks and access resources they are not entitled to. This is primarily due to the ability to send modified HTTP requests to view user data or unlock electronic locks associated with unauthorized zones, and create user logins for unauthorized zones.\n\nThe primary driver for selecting CWE-639 was its precise description of the **authorization bypass** mechanism using user-controlled keys. The vulnerability description clearly states that users can send modified requests to access unauthorized resources, indicating a direct manipulation of key values to bypass access controls. \"Users with login credentials assigned to a specific zone can send modified HTTP GET and POST requests, allowing them to view user data such as personal information and Prox card credentials. Also, an authorized user of one zone can send API requests to unlock electronic locks associated with zones they are unauthorized to have access to.\"\n\nCWE-200 was considered because the **authorization bypass** leads to the **exposure of sensitive information**. However, the primary weakness is the bypass itself, not the explicit mishandling or insertion of sensitive data. Therefore, CWE-200 is classified as a secondary concern.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-639 as the primary CWE is based on its alignment with the root cause of the vulnerability. The ability to manipulate keys and bypass authorization checks is the fundamental flaw that enables the other impacts. The evidence supports this classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n##
