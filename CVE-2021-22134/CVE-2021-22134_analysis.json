CWE-200 is a parent of CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere), CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data), and others. The description points towards a **disclosure** of information, but the root cause is an **incorrect** security permissions application.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect** application of security permissions, leading to the **exposure** of documents and fields that should not be visible to the attacker.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered the high-scoring CWE-200 due to the **disclosure** aspect of the vulnerability. However, the root cause is an authorization issue. Therefore, both CWE-200 and CWE-863 were considered.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description includes:\n- \"Get requests do not properly apply security permissions when executing a query against a recently updated document.\"\n- \"This could result in the search disclosing the existence of documents and fields the attacker should not be able to view.\"\n\nThe chosen CWEs reflect both the root cause (**incorrect** authorization) and the impact (**exposure** of sensitive information). Although CWE-200 is discouraged, it is still relevant to capture the impact. However, the main problem is the improper application of security permissions, which is why CWE-863 is a good candidate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n- CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n- CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n- CWE-612: Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information\n\nI am overriding the general mapping guidance for CWE-200 due to the need to capture the impact of the vulnerability, even though it is a Class-level CWE and is generally discouraged. The root cause is still captured with the addition of CWE-863.",
