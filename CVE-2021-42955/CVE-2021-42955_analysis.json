CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) is also considered because the root cause mentions hardcoded salt-password values. CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) is related to the misconfigured ACL permissions on the password reset executable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe620[\"CWE-620: Unverified Password Change\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n\n    cwe620 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe620 primary\n    class cwe259,cwe732 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **weakness** in the password reset mechanism, specifically an **unauthorized password reset** (CWE-620). This is combined with misconfigured ACL permissions (CWE-732) and **hardcoded** salt-password values (CWE-259), allowing a non-admin user to **reset the password** of the Remote Access Plus Server Admin account. The impact is gaining administrative access to the RAP web portal, which contains sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **unauthorized password reset** due to the improper design of the password reset workflow. The description \"any non-admin Windows user can **reset the password** of the Remote Access Plus Server Admin account\" clearly aligns with CWE-620 (Unverified Password Change). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports this by stating the \"**weak password reset mechanism lacking proper authentication**.\" The presence of \"**hardcoded** salt-password values\" suggests CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password). Furthermore, \"**Improper Access Control List (ACL) configuration**\" points towards CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource). The final assessment considered CWE-620 to be the primary weakness, with CWE-259 and CWE-732 as contributing factors.\n\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication) was considered, but it's a Class-level CWE, and CWE-620 provides more specific details about the **unverified password change**, making it a better fit. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was also considered, but authentication is present, although it's **weak**, making CWE-620 a more accurate classification.\n\nRelevant CWE
