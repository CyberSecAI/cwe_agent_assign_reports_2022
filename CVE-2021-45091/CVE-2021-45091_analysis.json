CWE-863 is a child of CWE-285 **Improper Authorization** (Class) and CWE-284 **Improper Access Control** (Pillar). The secondary CWE is CWE-1220 **Insufficient Granularity of Access Control** (Base) which is a child of CWE-284 **Improper Access Control** (Pillar).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe1220[\"CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe1220 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe1220 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect access control** (**ROOTCAUSE**), leading to the ability to forge system logs. This allows an attacker to inject incorrect system logs, which has a low impact on integrity.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description states that Stormshield Endpoint Security from 2.1.0 to 2.1.1 has **Incorrect Access Control**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further elaborates that the **ROOT CAUSE** is an unspecified vulnerability that allows an authenticated user to forge system logs, achieved by bypassing an access check.\n\nThe Retriever Results identify several candidate CWEs. The primary candidate is CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** (Class), with a high relevance score. The description of CWE-863, \"The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check,\" aligns well with the vulnerability where an access check is bypassed. The next candidate is CWE-1220 **Insufficient Granularity of Access Control** (Base) with a high relevance score. The description of CWE-1220, \"The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets\" also aligns well.\n\nCWE-284 **Improper Access Control** (Pillar) is too high-level as it is a pillar CWE. Although the vulnerability description contains the term \"**incorrect access control**\", the Retriever Results suggest more specific CWEs. CWE-306 **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** (Base) does not fit since the attacker is authenticated. CWE-732 **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource** (Class) doesn't fit the vulnerability description.\n\nBased on the analysis, the primary CWE is CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** (Class) because the authorization check is not correctly performed, allowing a bypass. The secondary CWE is CWE-1220 **Insufficient Granularity of Access Control** (Base). This provides more detail about the access control, and is often set by BIOS/bootloader.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n- CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control",
