While other CWEs like CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) and CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) are related, the description explicitly mentions an **out-of-bounds write**, making CWE-787 the most accurate and specific choice. The parent CWE, CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), is a broader category, and therefore less specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Out-of-bounds write** in ANGLE.\n2.  **Impact:** Potential heap corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary selection of CWE-787 is based on the explicit mention of \"**out of bounds write**\" in both the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, where the root cause is listed as \"**Out of bounds write** in ANGLE\".\n\n> **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**\n> - **weakness:** **Out of bounds write**\n>\n> **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**\n> ```\n> {\n>   \"vulnerability_details\": {\n>     \"root_cause\": \"Out of bounds write in ANGLE\",\n>     \"weaknesses\": [\n>       \"Out of bounds write\"\n>     ],\n\nThe retriever results and similar CVE descriptions also strongly support CWE-787 as the primary weakness.
