CWE-125 is, in turn, related to CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-20, Improper Input Validation, is a class-level CWE, and its use is discouraged when more specific CWEs are available. It can be seen as a broader cause of the buffer over-read.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe126 -->|ChildOf| cwe125\n    cwe125 -->|ChildOf| cwe119\n    cwe126 -->|CanPrecede| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe126 primary\n    class cwe125,cwe119,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper validation of user-supplied data**, leading to an **out-of-bounds read**, which results in information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the `Jt981.dll` library **lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing JT files**, which results in an **out of bounds read** past the end of an allocated buffer.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read), as it directly describes the **weakness** where the product reads from a buffer beyond its intended bounds. The \"**out of bounds read** past the end of an allocated buffer\" aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-126.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is considered as a secondary CWE because the root cause is **lacks proper validation of user-supplied data**. Although CWE-20 is a plausible cause, the description points to a more specific consequence: an **out-of-bounds read**. Therefore, CWE-126 is more descriptive and closer to the actual vulnerability. The mapping guidance for CWE-20 discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nThe retriever results also support CWE-125 and CWE-126.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\nCWE-126 is preferred over CWE-125, because CWE-126 is a variant of CWE-125 and the description matches the vulnerability details.",
