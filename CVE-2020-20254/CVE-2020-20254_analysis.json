CWE-476 is a child of CWE-710 and CWE-754. CWE-824 **Access of Uninitialized Pointer** is also a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-119. CWE-824 can precede CWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write** and CWE-125 **Out-of-bounds Read**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe824[\"CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe476 -->|CHILDOF| cwe710[\"CWE-710: Improper Adherence to Coding Standards\"]\n    cwe476 -->|CHILDOF| cwe754[\"CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe824 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe476 primary\n    class cwe824 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a memory corruption issue which leads to a **NULL pointer dereference**, ultimately causing a denial of service. An uninitialized pointer may be accessed, which could then lead to a **NULL pointer dereference**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states \"**NULL pointer dereference**\". The CVE reference links content summary also highlights the \"**NULL pointer dereference**\" as a weakness. The primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions is CWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write**, but the description aligns more closely with CWE-476 **NULL Pointer Dereference**.\n\nCWE-476 **NULL Pointer Dereference** is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions this weakness. The retriever results also list CWE-476 as the top combined result. The confidence in this mapping is high (0.9) due to the explicit mention of \"**NULL pointer dereference**\" in the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-824 **Access of Uninitialized Pointer** is considered as a secondary CWE because it could potentially precede the **NULL pointer dereference** if the pointer was uninitialized before being dereferenced. The confidence in this mapping is moderate (0.6) because it is a possible, but not explicitly stated, condition.\n\nCWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write** was considered due to its presence in similar CVE descriptions and its relation to memory corruption. However, since the explicit weakness is a **NULL pointer dereference** and not an out-of-bounds write, it was not selected.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
