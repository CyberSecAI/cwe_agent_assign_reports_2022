CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a class CWE and parent of CWE-787 and represents a more general case of memory corruption. CWE-416 (Use After Free) is a variant CWE that is related to memory management issues and could be present alongside CWE-787. The vulnerability description and CVE details provide sufficient evidence to choose CWE-787 as the primary root cause and CWE-416 as a possible secondary cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe120\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n    class cwe416 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **improper handling of ReadableStream and WritableStream objects** in WebRTC. This leads to a **heap buffer overflow** (CWE-787) due to confusion between the Caller and Callee. The heap buffer overflow can then result in heap corruption and potentially remote code execution. A **use-after-free** (CWE-416) condition is also mentioned as a possible weakness.\n  - **Root Cause:** Improper handling of ReadableStream and WritableStream objects.\n  - **Weakness 1:** **Heap-based buffer overflow** (CWE-787)\n  - **Weakness 2:** **Use-after-free** (CWE-416)\n  - **Impact:** Heap corruption, potential remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-416 (Use After Free) as the primary candidates based on the vulnerability description and CVE details. The CVE reference summary explicitly mentions \"**heap buffer overflow**\" and \"**Use-after-free**\" as weaknesses. The description also states that the vulnerability can cause \"**heap corruption**\".\n\nThe relationship analysis shows that CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which is a more general class of memory corruption vulnerabilities. However, CWE-787 is more specific and accurately reflects the **heap buffer overflow** condition described in the vulnerability. CWE-416 is a variant that can be related to heap overflows, but the description focuses more on the overflow itself.\n\nThe final decision is to classify this vulnerability as CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as the primary cause, since the root cause leads directly to this condition, and CWE-416 (Use After Free) as a secondary candidate, as it is mentioned in the CVE details and often related to heap overflows. This classification is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE details, the relationship analysis, and the mapping guidance that recommends using the most specific CWE available.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect
