The Retriever Results suggested CWE-939, which is a child of CWE-862. CWE-862 is a more specific version of access control, but the vulnerability description is not specific enough to warrant using a more specific version. This suggests a parent-child relationship where CWE-939 is a potential, more specific instance of CWE-284.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe939[\"CWE-939: Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme\"]\n    \n    cwe939 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe939 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper access control** (**rootcause**). This leads to app redirections (**impact**). The attack vector involves a malicious Wi-Fi network.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is **improper access control**. The vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary both support this. The retriever results also point to CWE-284 as a potential match. However, CWE-284 is a Pillar level CWE and is discouraged from use. The next best match from the retriever results is CWE-939.\n\nThe final decision is to assign CWE-284 as the primary CWE because it directly reflects the **root cause** identified in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. However, due to the discouraged usage of CWE-284, CWE-939 is a secondary candidate. The evidence supporting this decision includes the explicit mention of **improper access control** in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
