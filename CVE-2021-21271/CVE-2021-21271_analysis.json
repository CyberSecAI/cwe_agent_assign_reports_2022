It is related to CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')), indicating that it is a specific type of race condition. The secondary CWE, CWE-1250 (Improper Preservation of Consistency Between Independent Representations of Shared State) is a base level CWE, which is preferred for vulnerability mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe1250[\"CWE-1250: Improper Preservation of Consistency Between Independent Representations of Shared State\"]\n    \n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe367 primary\n    class cwe362,cwe1250 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect** assignment of responsibility for forming `DuplicateVoteEvidence` to the consensus reactor. This reactor uses the 'last commit' of the current block to assign a timestamp. Because the block is still \"in flight\", the 'last commit' is inconsistent across different nodes, leading to the **weakness** of a TOCTOU race condition (CWE-367). This results in the creation of `DuplicateVoteEvidence` with differing timestamps, causing nodes to disconnect and leading to a denial-of-service (DoS). There is an issue of Improper Preservation of Consistency Between Independent Representations of Shared State (CWE-1250), because the different nodes do not have the same view of the `last commit`\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-367 as the primary weakness due to the **time of check time of use (TOCTTOU)** condition that occurs when nodes form `DuplicateVoteEvidence` with inconsistent timestamps based on the \"last commit\" data. The final decision is based on the vulnerability description, which states \"different nodes in the network may observe **different last commits when assigning a timestamp to DuplicateVoteEvidence**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section also mentions that the root cause lies in the consensus reactor's responsibility for forming `DuplicateVoteEvidence` objects, which are assigned a timestamp using the 'last commit' of the current block, which is still 'in flight' and thus inconsistent across different nodes. This inconsistency creates the TOCTOU condition.\n\nCWE-367 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it directly addresses the race condition caused by the time difference between checking the state of the 'last commit' and using it to assign a timestamp.\n\nCWE-1250 (Improper Preservation of Consistency Between Independent Representations of Shared State) was considered as a secondary CWE because of the distributed nature of the system where each node maintains its own version of the `last commit` information. The vulnerability arises because these independent representations are not consistent across all nodes. This leads to discrepancies in the timestamps assigned to `DuplicateVoteEvidence`, triggering the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
