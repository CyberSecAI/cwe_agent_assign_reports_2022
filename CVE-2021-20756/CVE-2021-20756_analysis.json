The description indicates a **\"viewing restrictions bypass vulnerability\"**, pointing to an access control issue. While CWE-284 is high-level and discouraged, no specific child CWE precisely fits based on the provided information. CWE-359 is considered as a secondary CWE, because it can be the result of the **bypass** and that the application allows a remote authenticated attacker to obtain the data of Address without the viewing privilege.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe359 -->|ChildOf| cwe200\n    cwe200 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe359 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain begins with the **improper access control (CWE-284)**, leading to a **bypass** of viewing restrictions. This **bypass** results in the **exposure of data** without the viewing privilege, classified as **Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-359)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description indicates a **\"viewing restrictions bypass vulnerability\"**, directly pointing to an access control issue. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this with \"**Viewing restrictions bypass vulnerability** in Address\" and \"**CWE-264: Improper access control**.\" The impact is that \"a user who can log in to the product may obtain the data of Address without the viewing privilege.\"\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), which is a Pillar-level entry. However, the MITRE mapping guidance discourages its use due to its high-level nature. The guidance suggests considering descendants of CWE-284. Based on the information provided, the **bypass** of viewing restrictions leads to the **exposure of data** that should not be accessible, thus CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is considered a secondary CWE.\n\nThe evidence supports the selection of CWE-284 as the primary CWE because the vulnerability is fundamentally an access control issue. However, because the bypass leads to exposure, CWE-359 is also relevant.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity based on the available evidence. While more specific variants of access control issues might exist, the current information does not provide enough detail to pinpoint the exact flaw in the access control mechanism.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
