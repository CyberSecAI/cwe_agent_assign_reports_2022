This has child relationships to CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). The secondary CWE, CWE-338 (Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)), is a child of CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values). CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is independent but related to the vulnerability through its impact. The choice of CWE-640 is based on its specific focus on password recovery, while CWE-338 identifies the root cause of weak token generation and CWE-770 represents the lack of rate limiting.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe640[\"CWE-640: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password\"]\n    cwe338[\"CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n\n    cwe640 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe640 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe338 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe640 primary\n    class cwe338,cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **weak reset token generation** (CWE-338), leading to a **weak password recovery mechanism** (CWE-640). The absence of rate limiting (CWE-770) exacerbates the problem, allowing attackers to make multiple attempts to exploit the **predictable token**. The final impact is unauthorized access to user accounts.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-640, CWE-338, and CWE-770 as potential matches based on the vulnerability description. The final conclusion, which includes CWE-640 as the primary weakness and CWE-338 and CWE-770 as secondary weaknesses, is strongly supported by the evidence provided in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section:\n\n*   \"The password reset functionality in InvoicePlane v1.5.11 lacks rate limiting and uses a **predictable** method to generate password reset tokens.\"\n*   \"**CWE-640: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password:** The password reset token generation is flawed and predictable. It concatenates the current server time and user email, then generates an MD5 hash from this combination, making it relatively easy to guess.\"\n*   \"**CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling:** There is no rate limiting on password reset requests.\"\n\nCWE-640 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the weakness in the password recovery mechanism, aligning with MITRE's guidance. CWE-338, while more granular, represents the root cause of the predictable token generation. CWE-770 identifies the lack of rate limiting which allows for multiple password reset attempts, amplifying the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts within a short time frame.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
