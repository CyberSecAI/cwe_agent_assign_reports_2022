# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-22515

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-308 | Use of Single-factor Authentication | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability description states that the MFA functionality can be bypassed, effectively downgrading to single-factor authentication. |
| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. While the vulnerability leads to **improper authentication**, CWE-308 more precisely describes the **root cause**, which is the **use of single-factor authentication** after bypassing MFA. |
| CWE-1390 | Weak Authentication | 0.5 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary candidate. This CWE is a more general description of authentication issues, while the root cause is better represented with CWE-308. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-308, which is a Base level CWE. CWE-308 is a child of CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication), which is a Class level CWE. The relationship indicates that **Use of Single-factor Authentication** is a specific type of **Weak Authentication**. CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a parent of CWE-1390. This indicates that **Weak Authentication** is a type of **Improper Authentication**. CWE-308 is also a peer of CWE-309 (Use of Password System for Primary Authentication).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a flaw that allows bypassing the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This leads to a fallback to single-factor authentication, which is a weaker form of authentication. The final impact is unauthorized access to protected systems or resources.
- Root Cause: A flaw allowing bypass of MFA
- Weakness: Use of Single-factor Authentication (CWE-308)
- Impact: Unauthorized access to protected systems or resources

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the most accurate CWE to represent the vulnerability, which is a bypass of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) leading to the **use of single-factor authentication**.
The vulnerability description explicitly states that "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) functionality can be bypassed, allowing the use of single factor authentication...". This is strong evidence supporting the selection of CWE-308 (Use of Single-factor Authentication) as the primary CWE. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also indicates a "MFA downgrade issue," which reinforces the idea that the vulnerability results in a weaker authentication mechanism being used.

The graph relationships confirm that CWE-308 is a specific type of **Weak Authentication** (CWE-1390) and a form of **Improper Authentication** (CWE-287), but it is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability's **root cause**.

Other CWEs were considered but ultimately not chosen as the primary CWE because they were either too general or did not accurately reflect the specific nature of the vulnerability. For example, CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a more general category that encompasses various authentication issues, while CWE-308 specifically addresses the use of single-factor authentication, which is the direct result of the MFA bypass.
CWE-308 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **weakness** introduced by the vulnerability, which is the **use of single-factor authentication** instead of the intended multi-factor authentication. This level of detail is crucial for understanding the security implications and implementing effective mitigations.
