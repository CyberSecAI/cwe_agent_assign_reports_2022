This indicates a hierarchical relationship where using a password hash with insufficient computational effort (CWE-916) is a specific type of using a weak hash (CWE-328) or a broken/risky cryptographic algorithm (CWE-327). The abstraction levels also influenced the selection, favoring the more specific Base level CWE-916 over the more general Class level CWE-327.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    \n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe328\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe916 primary\n    class cwe328,cwe327 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the root cause, which is the **use of a weak hashing algorithm**. This leads directly to the impact, which is that an attacker can **retrieve passwords in cleartext**.\n  - The chain is: **Weak Hashing Algorithm** -> **Passwords Retrievable in Cleartext**\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **weak hashing algorithm** as the root cause, leading to the possibility of retrieving passwords in cleartext. The Retriever Results and the CVE reference link content summary pointed strongly towards CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) and CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash).\n\nThe evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"The vulnerability stems from the **use of a weak hashing algorithm** for password storage\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort (CWE-916).\" The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" also highlight the \"**weak hashing algorithm**\" as the root cause.\n\nCWE-916 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability, as it explicitly addresses the use of password hashes with insufficient computational effort, which aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description and the CVE details. CWE-328 is a more general case of using a weak hash, and while applicable, CWE-916 provides a more precise classification. CWE-327, Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm, is even more general and less specific to password hashing, making it a less suitable choice.\n\nThe graph relationships reinforce the choice of CWE-916, as it is a child of both CWE-328 and CWE-327, indicating that it is a more specialized form of these weaknesses. The MITRE mapping guidance also supports this decision, as CWE-916 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level for mapping root causes. The mapping guidance for CWE-916 indicates \"Allowed\" usage.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause of the vulnerability (insufficient computational effort in password hashing) and avoid more general classifications that would not capture the specific nature of the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
