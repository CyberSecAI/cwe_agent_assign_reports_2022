CWE-1333 is a child of CWE-407 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption).\n\nCWE-1284 is related because the vulnerability could be seen as a failure to validate the size or complexity of the input string that is fed into the regular expression. CWE-1284 is a child of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). CWE-1284 can precede CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value), but this is not directly relevant here.\n\nCWE-770 is related because the inefficient regular expression leads to excessive resource consumption. CWE-770 is a parent of CWE-789.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe1284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe789\n    cwe770 -->|PARENTOF| cwe789\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe1284,cwe770 secondary\n    class cwe407,cwe20,cwe789 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the use of an **inefficient regular expression** (CWE-1333). This leads to excessive CPU consumption when processing a specially crafted input string. The excessive CPU consumption results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the server.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **inefficient regular expression** (CWE-1333) used to parse the `Sec-Websocket-Protocol` header. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section states: \"The vulnerability stems from a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) issue in the `ws` Node.js library. Specifically, the library used an inefficient regular expression to parse the `Sec-Websocket-Protocol` header.\" This directly supports the selection of CWE-1333. The fix mentioned in the summary, \"using `protocol = protocol.split(',').map(trim);` instead of using the vulnerable regex,\" further confirms that the root cause is related to the regular expression.\n\nCWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is a secondary consideration. While not the primary driver, the vulnerability can be viewed as a failure to properly validate the complexity or length of the input string before processing it with the regex. This lack of validation contributes to the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-770 is also a consideration since the inefficient regex leads to uncontrolled resource consumption, but CWE-1333 is more specific to the root cause.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence provided, the relationships between the CWEs, and the goal of selecting the most specific CWE that accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nNOT USED: This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to CRLF injection.\n\n## CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product acts as an intermediary HTTP agent\n         (such as a proxy or firewall) in the data flow between two\n         entities such as a client and server, but it does not\n         interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that\n         are consistent with how the messages will be processed by\n         those entities that are at the ultimate destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nNOT USED: This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to HTTP request smuggling.\n\n## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nNOT USED: This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not about length inconsistencies.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nNOT USED: This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not about unsafe equivalence.\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nNOT USED: This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to format string injection.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nNOT USED: This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not about an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted",
