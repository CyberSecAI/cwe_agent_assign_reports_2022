While CWE-200 is a broader category, the vulnerability description suggests that the exposed sensitive information relates to system-level details, making CWE-497 a more specific, albeit less confident, secondary candidate. The discouragement of using CWE-200 generally pushes for more specific mappings, further supporting the consideration of CWE-497.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Sensitive data exposure** due to **explicit insertion** of sensitive information into resources or **unintentional exposure**\n2.  **Weakness:** The application **fails to protect** sensitive information from unauthorized access\n3.  **Impact:** A local authenticated user with low privileges can access sensitive information\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, CWE-200 appears to be the most suitable mapping due to the **sensitive data exposure** described in the vulnerability. However, CWE-200 is discouraged for general use and suggests mapping to more specific CWEs. The description mentions a local authenticated user with low privileges gaining access to sensitive information, leaning towards a more system-level exposure.\n\nCWE-497, \"Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere,\" is considered as a secondary candidate because it addresses the system-level aspect of the exposure.\n\nThe final assessment relies on the provided evidence, specifically:\n- \"Dell Wyse Device Agent version 14.5.4.1 and below contain a **sensitive data exposure** vulnerability.\"\n- \"A local authenticated user with low privileges could potentially exploit this vulnerability in order to access sensitive information.\"\n\nThe choice of CWE-200 as primary with CWE-497 as secondary reflects the initial broad classification and a more specific, though less confidently asserted, classification based on system-level details.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\nNot selected.
