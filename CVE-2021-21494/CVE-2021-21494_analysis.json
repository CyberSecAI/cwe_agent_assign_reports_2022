CWE-1004 is a related secondary weakness, indicating the sensitive cookie lacks the HTTPOnly flag, exacerbating the impact of the XSS vulnerability. The hierarchical relationship is that CWE-79 can lead to the exploitation of session tokens because of the missing HTTPOnly flag (CWE-1004).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe1004[\"CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Security-Critical Resource\"]\n    \n    cwe1004 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    cwe79 -->|CANEXPLOIT| cwe1004\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe1004 secondary\n    class cwe732 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of input (CWE-79)** in the `tipo` parameter of `admin/logs_ajax.php`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script into the web page. The injected script can then access the `centralmka2` cookie because it **lacks the HTTPOnly flag (CWE-1004)**. The attacker can then use this stolen session token to impersonate the admin.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the provided CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The description explicitly states \"**XSS** via the admin/logs_ajax.php tipo parameter. An attacker can leverage this to read the centralmka2 (session token) cookie, which is not set to HTTPOnly.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this:\n    - Reflected XSS vulnerability in the \"registro\" parameter of the \"logs_ajax.php\" page.\n    - The session token \"centralmka2\" cookie lacks the HTTPOnly flag.\n\nThe selection of CWE-79 and CWE-1004 is at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-79 accurately describes the **root cause** of the **cross-site scripting** vulnerability, while CWE-1004 specifies the missing HTTPOnly flag, which is a critical detail contributing to the impact of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)) was considered, but it is not directly applicable as the vulnerability is an XSS, not a CSRF. CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) was also considered but is not applicable as this vulnerability does not involve file uploads. CWE-138 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements) is too high-level, and CWE-79 is a more specific and accurate match. CWE-472 (External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter) doesn't fit as the vulnerability isn't directly related to tampering with assumed-immutable parameters. CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')) is not applicable as there's no mention of SQL injection.",
