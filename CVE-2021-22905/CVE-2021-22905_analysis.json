The secondary CWE, CWE-923, is a Class level CWE that is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). The vulnerability involves the transmission of sensitive information, which aligns with CWE-201. The communication channel aspect, where the app sends data to an unintended endpoint (lookup server), suggests CWE-923.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    cwe923[\"CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe923 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe923 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the following:\n1.  The Nextcloud Android app by default sends user search queries to an external lookup server (root cause).\n2.  This leads to the exposure of sensitive information in the transmitted data (CWE-201).\n3.  The app does not properly restrict the communication channel to the intended endpoint (local server), leading to communication with an unintended endpoint (lookup server) (CWE-923).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-201 as a strong candidate based on the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" highlighting information disclosure and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explaining the root cause as the Nextcloud Android app performing searches for share recipients on the lookup server by default. The retriever results also listed CWE-201 as the top combined result, solidifying this choice.\n\nCWE-923 was considered because the app unintentionally communicates with an external server. This aspect of the vulnerability aligns with the description of CWE-923, which concerns improper restriction of a communication channel to intended endpoints.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence provided, including the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. CWE-201 is selected as the primary CWE due to the explicit **impact** being information disclosure, and the app **inserting sensitive information into sent data**. CWE-923 is a secondary issue.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-201 is a Base level CWE, and CWE-923 is a Class level CWE. Both provide sufficient detail to accurately represent the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
