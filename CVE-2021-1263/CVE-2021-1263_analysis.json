CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77 and CWE-74. The relationship of CWE-78 to CWE-77 influenced the decision to choose CWE-78, since CWE-78 is more specific. CWE-20 is a class level CWE and is a parent of CWE-119.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe119 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe74,cwe20, cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is:\n1.  **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20)\n2.  **OS Command Injection** (CWE-78) leading to\n3.  Privilege Escalation and File System Access\n\nThe root cause is **insufficient validation of user-supplied input** leading to **command injection**. The impact is the ability to **take certain actions with root privileges** and **read, write, and delete files**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **command injection** as the main weakness.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms the root cause as \"Insufficient validation of user-supplied input on the Command Line Interface (CLI) of Cisco SD-WAN Software\" and the weakness as \"**Command Injection**.\" The impact includes \"Privilege Escalation\" and \"File System Access.\"\n\nThe retriever results suggested CWE-77 and CWE-78 as top candidates. CWE-78 is more specific, referring to OS Command Injection, which aligns well with the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary.\n\nThe final decision is to assign CWE-78 as the primary CWE due to the OS command context and the available evidence. CWE-20 is considered as a secondary weakness but is discouraged as per MITRE guidance, making the confidence lower.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-78 directly addresses the type of command injection and is a base level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-24: Path Traversal: '../filedir'\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize \"../\" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
