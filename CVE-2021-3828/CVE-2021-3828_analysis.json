While CWE-407 is broader, CWE-1333 specifically addresses the use of regular expressions. Since the vulnerability is related to regular expression complexity, CWE-1333 is a more specific and appropriate choice. CWE-185 **Incorrect Regular Expression** is a class level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    cwe185[\"CWE-185: Incorrect Regular Expression\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe185 -->|CHILDOF| cwe697[\"CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407,cwe185 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **inefficient regular expression complexity** (CWE-1333) that leads to excessive CPU consumption, resulting in a denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **inefficient regular expression complexity** (CWE-1333). The vulnerability description clearly states that the `KEYWORD` regular expression within the `comparative_sents.py` file of the `nltk` library is vulnerable to ReDoS. The description also mentions the regex `r\"\\((?!.\\*\\()(.\\*)\\)$\"` was susceptible to long processing times when provided with a crafted input. This aligns perfectly with CWE-1333, which describes a regular expression with an inefficient worst-case computational complexity.\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section provides additional evidence, stating that the original regular expression `r\"\\((?!.\\*\\()(.\\*)\\)$\"` was vulnerable to ReDoS due to the nested repetition of `.*` combined with lookaheads, which causes exponential backtracking on specific inputs. This reinforces the selection of CWE-1333.\n\nThe evidence supports the selection of CWE-1333 because the **root cause** of the vulnerability is directly related to the inefficient complexity of the regular expression.\n\nCWE-407 was considered but not chosen as the primary CWE because it is a more general class that encompasses inefficiencies in algorithms, whereas CWE-1333 is specific to regular expressions.\n\nCWE-185 was also considered but it is about regular expressions that are written incorrectly, and thus cause data to be improperly matched. This is not the case here, where the regular expression matches, but does so inefficiently.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
