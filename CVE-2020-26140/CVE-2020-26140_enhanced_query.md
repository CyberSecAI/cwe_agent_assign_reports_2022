## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26140:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The content from multiple sources directly mentions and describes CVE-2020-26140, confirming its relevance. The description is consistent across the various sources. This CVE is a part of a set of vulnerabilities collectively known as "FragAttacks".

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in the improper handling of plaintext data frames within protected Wi-Fi networks by vulnerable implementations. These implementations accept plaintext data frames, even when the network is supposed to be secured using WEP, WPA, WPA2, or WPA3.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Proper Encryption Enforcement:** The primary weakness is the failure to enforce encryption for all data frames within a protected network. This is a deviation from the expected behavior of encrypted networks, where all data should be encrypted with a key negotiated during the authentication process.
*   **Acceptance of Unencrypted Data:** The vulnerability exists because vulnerable Wi-Fi implementations accept data frames that are not encrypted, despite being associated with a protected network. This implies missing checks within the Wi-Fi stack that would verify the encryption status of each frame.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Data Injection:** The acceptance of plaintext frames enables an attacker to inject arbitrary network packets into the protected network.
*   **Bypassing Network Security:** The attacker can bypass the security measures that were intended to protect the network (i.e., encryption). This allows the attacker to inject malicious traffic, modify data, or perform other attacks within the network.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Wireless Medium:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the air, where the attacker transmits the plaintext data frames towards the targeted device(s).
*   **Proximity Required:** The attacker must be within the range of the Wi-Fi network to inject these plaintext data frames.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker is not required to be authenticated or associated with the target Wi-Fi network to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability is exploited by simply sending unencrypted data frames.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Wireless Capabilities:** The attacker needs to possess hardware and software to transmit and inject 802.11 frames.
*   **Proximity:** The attacker must be within radio range of the targeted devices in the Wi-Fi network.
*   **Packet Crafting:** The attacker needs to craft the injected data frame without encryption. No higher level authentication is needed to conduct the attack, it is purely an L2/L1 exploit.

**Additional Details (from the provided content):**

*   The vulnerability is present in various Wi-Fi implementations, including those used in both access points (APs) and clients.
*   The vulnerability is not related to any other specific CVEs in the FragAttacks set of vulnerabilities and can be independently exploited, i.e, one vulnerability is not required to exploit others.
*   The attack can be used to achieve various goals, including ARP spoofing, DNS poisoning and bypassing firewalls.
*   Some implementations accept plaintext A-MSDU frames if they start with an EAPOL header.
*   Some implementations accept plaintext broadcast fragments.
*   Some devices reject normal (non-fragmented) plaintext frames but do accept fragmented plaintext frames (CVE-2020-26143), making the fragmented version more dangerous as an attacker could also bypass network filters that are designed to detect plain text traffic.
*   A multi-channel man-in-the-middle (MitM) position can facilitate the exploitation of some of the other discovered vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerability can also be used to launch denial-of-service attacks.

In summary, CVE-2020-26140 allows an attacker to inject arbitrary data into a protected Wi-Fi network by sending plaintext frames which should not be accepted. This highlights a critical lack of input validation in the handling of 802.11 frames.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-354: Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not validate or incorrectly validates the integrity check values or "checksums" of a message. This may prevent it from detecting if the data has been modified or corrupted in transmission.

### Extended Description
Improper validation of checksums before use results in an unnecessary risk that can easily be mitigated. The protocol specification describes the algorithm used for calculating the checksum. It is then a simple matter of implementing the calculation and verifying that the calculated checksum and the received checksum match. Improper verification of the calculated checksum and the received checksum can lead to far greater consequences.

## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

- **CVE-2009-1048:** VOIP product allows authentication bypass using 127.0.0.1 in the Host header.




## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.

### Alternative Terms
None

- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.




## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.

### Extended Description


When an attacker can modify an externally-controlled format string, this can lead to buffer overflows, denial of service, or data representation problems.


It should be noted that in some circumstances, such as internationalization, the set of format strings is externally controlled by design. If the source of these format strings is trusted (e.g. only contained in library files that are only modifiable by the system administrator), then the external control might not itself pose a vulnerability.

### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

This weakness is possible in any programming language that support format strings.


**[Other]** 

While Format String vulnerabilities typically fall under the Buffer Overflow category, technically they are not overflowed buffers. The Format String vulnerability is fairly new (circa 1999) and stems from the fact that there is no realistic way for a function that takes a variable number of arguments to determine just how many arguments were passed in. The most common functions that take a variable number of arguments, including C-runtime functions, are the printf() family of calls. The Format String problem appears in a number of ways. A *printf() call without a format specifier is dangerous and can be exploited. For example, printf(input); is exploitable, while printf(y, input); is not exploitable in that context. The result of the first call, used incorrectly, allows for an attacker to be able to peek at stack memory since the input string will be used as the format specifier. The attacker can stuff the input string with format specifiers and begin reading stack values, since the remaining parameters will be pulled from the stack. Worst case, this improper use may give away enough control to allow an arbitrary value (or values in the case of an exploit program) to be written into the memory of the running program.


Frequently targeted entities are file names, process names, identifiers.


Format string problems are a classic C/C++ issue that are now rare due to the ease of discovery. One main reason format string vulnerabilities can be exploited is due to the %n operator. The %n operator will write the number of characters, which have been printed by the format string therefore far, to the memory pointed to by its argument. Through skilled creation of a format string, a malicious user may use values on the stack to create a write-what-where condition. Once this is achieved, they can execute arbitrary code. Other operators can be used as well; for example, a %9999s operator could also trigger a buffer overflow, or when used in file-formatting functions like fprintf, it can generate a much larger output than intended.


**[Research Gap]** Format string issues are under-studied for languages other than C. Memory or disk consumption, control flow or variable alteration, and data corruption may result from format string exploitation in applications written in other languages such as Perl, PHP, Python, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-1825:** format string in Perl program
- **CVE-2001-0717:** format string in bad call to syslog function

## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Often, indexable resources such as memory buffers or files can be accessed using a specific position, index, or offset, such as an index for an array or a position for a file. When untrusted input is not properly validated before it is used as an index, attackers could access (or attempt to access) unauthorized portions of these resources. This could be used to cause buffer overflows, excessive resource allocation, or trigger unexpected failures.
