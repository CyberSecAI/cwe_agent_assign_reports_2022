### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** returns different responses for invalid authentication requests depending on whether the username exists
- **product:** Cibele Thinfinity VirtualUI
- **version:** before 3.0
- **component:** /changePassword

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-44848:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the `/changePassword` endpoint in Thinfinity VirtualUI. The application's response to requests sent to the `/changePassword` endpoint reveals if a username exists on the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **User Enumeration:** The primary weakness is the ability to enumerate valid usernames present in the underlying operating system (Windows). This occurs due to the difference in error messages presented based on whether the username is valid or not.
- **Lack of Rate Limiting or Account Lockout:** The report does not mention any rate-limiting or lockout mechanism that would prevent a brute-force attack to enumerate users, making it easier for attackers to gather information.
- **Insufficient Security Controls on the `/changePassword` endpoint:** The endpoint should not be revealing information about valid user accounts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gather a list of valid usernames that can be later used in other attacks.
- **Increased Attack Surface:** Knowing valid usernames increases the attack surface and could facilitate brute-force attacks against passwords, or other targeted attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/changePassword` endpoint with a `username` parameter.
- **Brute-Force Enumeration:** Attackers can use automated tools to brute-force different usernames, observing the response to determine valid accounts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Thinfinity VirtualUI application, specifically access to the `/changePassword` endpoint.
- **No Authentication Required:** This vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** Attackers need to be able to send HTTP requests and interpret HTTP responses.

**Additional Details:**

-   **Vulnerable Versions:** The following versions were tested to be vulnerable: 2.1.37.2, 2.1.42.2, 2.5.0.0, 2.5.36.1, 2.5.36.2, and 2.5.41.0.
-   **Fixed Version:** This vulnerability was fixed in v3.0.
-  **Response Analysis**: The server responds differently for valid vs. invalid usernames. This allows an attacker to infer user existence. The response may be displayed in different languages depending on the VirtualUI configuration.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.

### Extended Description
This issue frequently occurs during authentication, where a difference in failed-login messages could allow an attacker to determine if the username is valid or not. These exposures can be inadvertent (bug) or intentional (design).

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-203

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** can overlap errors related to escalated privileges



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-2094:** This, and others, use ".." attacks and monitor error responses, so there is overlap with directory traversal.
- **CVE-2001-1483:** Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses
- **CVE-2001-1528:** Account number enumeration via inconsistent responses.




## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

### Extended Description
Discrepancies can take many forms, and variations may be detectable in timing, control flow, communications such as replies or requests, or general behavior. These discrepancies can reveal information about the product's operation or internal state to an unauthorized actor. In some cases, discrepancies can be used by attackers to form a side channel.

### Alternative Terms
Side Channel Attack: Observable Discrepancies are at the root of side channel attacks.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-200
ChildOf -> CWE-200

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-8695:** Observable discrepancy in the RAPL interface for some Intel processors allows information disclosure.
- **CVE-2019-14353:** Crypto hardware wallet's power consumption relates to total number of pixels illuminated, creating a side channel in the USB connection that allows attackers to determine secrets displayed such as PIN numbers and passwords
- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies




## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

### Extended Description
In security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Often primary in cryptographic applications and algorithms.

**[Maintenance]** CWE 4.16 removed a demonstrative example for a hardware module because it was inaccurate and unable to be adapted. The CWE team is developing an alternative.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies
- **CVE-2019-10482:** Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels
- **CVE-2014-0984:** Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.




## CWE-620: Unverified Password Change
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When setting a new password for a user, the product does not require knowledge of the original password, or using another form of authentication.

### Extended Description
This could be used by an attacker to change passwords for another user, thus gaining the privileges associated with that user.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1390

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-0681:** Web app allows remote attackers to change the passwords of arbitrary users without providing the original password, and possibly perform other unauthorized actions.
- **CVE-2000-0944:** Web application password change utility doesn't check the original password.




## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).




## CWE-640: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product contains a mechanism for users to recover or change their passwords without knowing the original password, but the mechanism is weak.

### Extended Description


It is common for an application to have a mechanism that provides a means for a user to gain access to their account in the event they forget their password. Very often the password recovery mechanism is weak, which has the effect of making it more likely that it would be possible for a person other than the legitimate system user to gain access to that user's account. Weak password recovery schemes completely undermine a strong password authentication scheme.


This weakness may be that the security question is too easy to guess or find an answer to (e.g. because the question is too common, or the answers can be found using social media). Or there might be an implementation weakness in the password recovery mechanism code that may for instance trick the system into e-mailing the new password to an e-mail account other than that of the user. There might be no throttling done on the rate of password resets so that a legitimate user can be denied service by an attacker if an attacker tries to recover their password in a rapid succession. The system may send the original password to the user rather than generating a new temporary password. In summary, password recovery functionality, if not carefully designed and implemented can often become the system's weakest link that can be misused in a way that would allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1390
ChildOf -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This entry appears to be frequently misused for any weakness related to password changes, even though the name focuses on "Password Recovery" for a "forgotten" password.
**Comments:** CWE-640 should only be used when there is a "password recovery" mechanism for forgotten passwords. Consider password-related entries under CWE-1390: Weak Authentication.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry might be reclassified as a category or "loose composite," since it lists multiple specific errors that can make the mechanism weak. However, under view 1000, it could be a weakness under protection mechanism failure, although it is different from most PMF issues since it is related to a feature that is designed to bypass a protection mechanism (specifically, the lack of knowledge of a password).

**[Maintenance]** This entry probably needs to be split; see extended description.






## CWE-385: Covert Timing Channel
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Covert timing channels convey information by modulating some aspect of system behavior over time, so that the program receiving the information can observe system behavior and infer protected information.

### Extended Description


In some instances, knowing when data is transmitted between parties can provide a malicious user with privileged information. Also, externally monitoring the timing of operations can potentially reveal sensitive data. For example, a cryptographic operation can expose its internal state if the time it takes to perform the operation varies, based on the state.


Covert channels are frequently classified as either storage or timing channels. Some examples of covert timing channels are the system's paging rate, the time a certain transaction requires to execute, and the time it takes to gain access to a shared bus.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-514

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.9, members of the CWE Hardware SIG are working to improve CWE's coverage of transient execution weaknesses, which include issues related to Spectre, Meltdown, and other attacks that create or exploit covert channels. As a result of that work, this entry might change in CWE 4.10.






## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses




## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1390
ChildOf -> CWE-287
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30018:** A messaging platform serializes all elements of User/Group objects, making private information available to adversaries
- **CVE-2022-29959:** Initialization file contains credentials that can be decoded using a "simple string transformation"
- **CVE-2022-35411:** Python-based RPC framework enables pickle functionality by default, allowing clients to unpickle untrusted data.




## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

### Extended Description


Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.


For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.


One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.


### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.
