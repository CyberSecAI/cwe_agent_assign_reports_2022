CWE-330 is a child of CWE-693 **Protection Mechanism Failure**. CWE-340 **Generation of Predictable Numbers or Identifiers** is also a child of CWE-330, representing a parallel classification. Selecting CWE-334 provides the most specific identification of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe334[\"CWE-334: Small Space of Random Values\"]\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n    cwe340[\"CWE-340: Generation of Predictable Numbers or Identifiers\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    \n    cwe334 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n    cwe340 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n    cwe330 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe334 primary\n    class cwe330,cwe340 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **ROOT CAUSE** of having a **small space of random values** (CWE-334). This leads to the possibility of predicting valid session IDs, allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access or information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and supporting evidence. The description explicitly mentions \"**small space of random values**\" as the **weakness**, which aligns directly with CWE-334 **Small Space of Random Values**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that the root cause is the FortiSandbox RPC API using a **small space of random values** for generating session IDs, making them predictable. The retriever results also list CWE-334 as the top candidate with a high score.\n\nCWE-334 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The mapping guidance for CWE-334 states that it is ALLOWED and that one should carefully read both the name and description to ensure it is an appropriate fit. The vulnerability description and supporting evidence align perfectly with CWE-334.\n\nCWE-330 **Use of Insufficiently Random Values** and CWE-340 **Generation of Predictable Numbers or Identifiers** were also considered. However, CWE-334 is a more specific case of both of these, making it the more appropriate choice. The mapping guidance for CWE-330 discourages its use and suggests examining its children for a better fit. Similarly, the mapping guidance for CWE-340 suggests examining its children for a better fit.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence and mapping guidance, CWE-334 **Small Space of Random Values** is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-341: Predictable from Observable State\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA number or object is predictable based on observations that the attacker can make about the state of the system or network, such as time, process ID, etc.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which",
