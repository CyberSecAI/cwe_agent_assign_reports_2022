There are no parent-child or peer relationships that are relevant to this specific case given the available evidence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe319 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: The **weakness** is that the web server transmits data without TLS encryption which results in sensitive information being transmitted in cleartext (CWE-319). This allows an unauthenticated attacker in a man-in-the-middle position to read sensitive data or modify data in transit.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the vulnerability description, the most appropriate CWE is CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information). The vulnerability description explicitly states that the web server transmits data without TLS encryption, which directly aligns with the definition of CWE-319.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is:\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**: \"**weakness:** **transmit data without TLS encryption**\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**: \"The web server of affected devices transmits data without TLS encryption.\"\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-319 as the top candidate with the highest score.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but deemed less appropriate:\n\n*   CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm): While related to cryptography, this CWE focuses on the algorithm itself being flawed, not the absence of encryption.\n*   CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation): This CWE is relevant when certificates are not properly validated, but the core issue here is the lack of encryption, not certificate validation.\n*   CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength): This CWE is about using encryption that is not strong enough, but the vulnerability description explicitly states that data is transmitted *without* encryption.\n\nTherefore, CWE-319 is the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA protocol or its implementation supports interaction between multiple actors and allows those actors to negotiate which algorithm should be used as a protection mechanism such as encryption or authentication, but it does not select the strongest algorithm that is available to both parties.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
