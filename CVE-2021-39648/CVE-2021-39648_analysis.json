This can lead to CWE-416, Use After Free, where memory is accessed after it has been freed. The relationship is that CWE-362 can precede CWE-416. CWE-362 is a Class, while CWE-416 is a Variant, providing a more specific description of the vulnerability's result.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe662[\"CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\"]\n    \n    cwe362 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    cwe362 -->|CHILDOF| cwe662\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe416 secondary\n    class cwe662 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper synchronization** during concurrent execution (**CWE-362**), which leads to a **use-after-free** condition (**CWE-416**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a **race condition**, which aligns with **CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'))**. The CVE reference link content summary provides more details about a **use-after-free** vulnerability, indicating that **CWE-416 (Use After Free)** is also relevant.\n\nThe evidence supporting the selection of **CWE-362** is: \"In gadget_dev_desc_UDC_show of configfs.c, there is a possible disclosure of kernel heap memory due to a **race condition**.\"\n\nThe evidence supporting the selection of **CWE-416** is from the CVE reference link content summary: \"The vulnerability is a use-after-free (UAF) issue that occurs when accessing `udc_name` in the `gadget_dev_desc_UDC_store` function after it has been freed in the `unregister_gadget` function.\"\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-362 can precede CWE-416, indicating that the race condition is a contributing factor to the use-after-free vulnerability. The selection of CWE-362 as the primary CWE is based on the initial vulnerability description emphasizing the race condition. The selection of CWE-416 is based on the detailed analysis of the root cause provided in the CVE reference. Both CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-362 being a Class and CWE-416 being a Variant.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
