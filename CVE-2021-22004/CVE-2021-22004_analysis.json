This is a base-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. No parent-child or chain relationships significantly influenced this decision, as the provided information directly supports this CWE. While other CWEs like CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) and CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory) were considered due to their relevance to file handling, CWE-427 was chosen because it specifically addresses the issue of using a search path that includes locations controlled by an attacker.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe427[\"CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory\"]\n\n    cwe427 -->|PEEROF| cwe73\n    cwe427 -->|PEEROF| cwe22\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe427 primary\n    class cwe73,cwe22 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the Salt minion installer **accepting and using a minion config file** from a location that can be controlled by a malicious actor. This leads to the subversion of the intended behavior of the minion software. The root cause is the **uncontrolled search path element** where the installer looks for configuration files.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description, which indicates that the salt minion installer accepts a minion config file from a location it should not.\n> \"The salt minion installer will **accept and use a minion config file** at C:\\salt\\conf if that file is in place before the installer is run. This allows for a malicious actor to **subvert the proper behaviour** of the given minion software.\"\n\nThe key here is the phrase \"**accept and use minion config file**\" which indicates the installer is using a configuration file from a location that is potentially under the control of an attacker. This directly aligns with CWE-427 (Uncontrolled Search Path Element). The other CWEs from the retriever results, such as CWE-73 and CWE-22, relate to file path manipulation, but don't specifically address the scenario where the installer searches a path and uses a file from an untrusted location.\n\nCWE-427 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it describes the weakness directly. It's a base-level CWE that precisely captures the vulnerability: the installer's use of a configuration file from a potentially malicious location in its search path.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
