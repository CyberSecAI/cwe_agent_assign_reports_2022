It can precede CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere). CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe942[\"CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\"]\n    cwe183[\"CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\"]\n    cwe923[\"CWE-923: Improperly Implemented Security Check for Origin\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe942 -->|ChildOf| cwe183\n    cwe942 -->|ChildOf| cwe923\n    cwe942 -->|ChildOf| cwe863\n    cwe942 -->|CanPrecede| cwe668\n    cwe200 -->|ChildOf| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe942 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe183,cwe923,cwe863,cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **overly permissive cross-domain policy** (CWE-942), which allows unauthorized access to resources, ultimately leading to potential information disclosure (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability was identified as having a root cause related to an **overly permissive cross-domain policy**, leading to sensitive information disclosure. The primary factor influencing the selection of CWE-942 was the direct mention of the \"cross-domain policy\" in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states: \"IBM QRadar User Behavior Analytics 1.0.0 through 4.1.0 could disclose sensitive information due an **overly permissive cross-domain policy**.\" Additionally, the CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"The User Behavior Analytics application add-on for IBM QRadar SIEM has an **overly permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy**.\" This provides strong evidence for selecting CWE-942, which is a variant-level CWE and thus more specific than its parent CWEs.\n\nCWE-200 was considered because the impact of the vulnerability is sensitive information disclosure. However, CWE-200 is a class-level CWE and is often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate. The root cause is the **overly permissive cross-domain policy**, making CWE-942 a more accurate and specific classification. The evidence provided strongly supports the selection of CWE-942 as the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
