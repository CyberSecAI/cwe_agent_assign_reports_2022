CWE-257 is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), which is a Class level CWE. CWE-257 is also a peer of CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password). CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) is also a Class, and is related to password hashing with insufficient computational effort (CWE-916). The choice of CWE-257 is influenced by its direct match to the vulnerability description where passwords are encrypted in a recoverable format.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe257[\"CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    \n    cwe257 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe257 -->|PEEROF| cwe259\n    cwe327 -->|PARENTOF| cwe916\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe257 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe327 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with the **rootcause**: **recoverable encryption of passwords**, which leads to the **impact**: disclose credentials and further compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions that passwords are encrypted in a **recoverable format**. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format): \"The storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also confirms that the device encrypts passwords using a weak or recoverable format.\n\nCWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) and CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) were considered as secondary CWEs. CWE-327 is a more general class of vulnerability, where a broken or risky algorithm is used. CWE-522 is also a class, which describes credentials being transmitted or stored using an insecure method. While these are applicable, CWE-257 is more specific to the **rootcause** of passwords being stored in a recoverable format.\n\nThe final selection is based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section. The hierarchical relationships support the decision to choose the base level CWE, and the mapping guidance allows for the use of CWE-257.",
