The root cause is the multiple calls to `sfree(rsc.text)` in different code paths within the `get_token` function in `input.c`. This is triggered by a crafted text document, potentially leading to a denial of service.\n\nThe evidence for selecting CWE-415 is strong, as the vulnerability description explicitly states \"a **double free** in cleanup_index\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this with details about how the `get_token` function frees the same memory location twice.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision by showing that while other CWEs like CWE-416 (Use After Free) and CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition) are related, CWE-415 directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability. The abstraction level of Variant for CWE-415 is appropriate, providing a specific classification for this type of memory corruption.\n\nThe selection of CWE-415 is based on the provided evidence, its specific description matching the vulnerability, and its appropriate abstraction level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-415: Double Free**\n\n*Technical Explanation:* The vulnerability involves freeing the same memory address twice. This corrupts memory management data structures, potentially leading to a crash or, in some circumstances, allowing an attacker to control memory allocation via subsequent `malloc()` calls.\n\n*Security Implications:* A **double free** can lead to a denial of service (application crash) and, potentially, remote code execution if an attacker can manipulate memory allocation after the double free occurs.\n\n*Parent-Child Relationships:* CWE-415 is a variant of CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference), CWE-1341 (Multiple Releases of Same Resource or Handle), and CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiration).\n\n*Chain Patterns:* A **double free** can be a consequence of other weaknesses such as race conditions (CWE-362) or signal handler issues (CWE-364).\n\n*MITRE Mapping Guidance:* The usage is ALLOWED, and the rationale states that this CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\n*Other CWEs Considered but Not Used:*\n\n*   CWE-416 (Use After Free): Considered but not selected because the vulnerability is specifically a **double free**, not using memory after it has been freed.\n*   CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization): While concurrency issues can lead to **double free**s, there's no evidence of concurrent execution in this specific vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition): Considered a potential consequence of a **double free**, but CWE-415 directly addresses the root cause.\n*   CWE-364 and CWE-828 (Signal Handler Race Condition/Functionality that is not Asynchronous-Safe): These are not applicable because there is no mention of signal handlers in the vulnerability description.",
