However, this is a Pillar-level CWE and discouraged for use. The vulnerability also involves the ability to upload files with dangerous types and rename them with externally controlled file names. This makes CWE-434 and CWE-73 relevant. CWE-434 can lead to CWE-73 because after an unrestricted upload, the attacker might be able to control the filename.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    \n    cwe434 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe73\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe434,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Access Control** (CWE-284), which allows an attacker to upload files without restrictions on the file type (CWE-434). Subsequently, the attacker can rename the uploaded file to a malicious extension due to **External Control of File Name or Path** (CWE-73), leading to potential code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description points to **Improper Access Control** (CWE-284). However, CWE-284 is a Pillar-level CWE and is discouraged. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides additional details, indicating that the application does not filter or validate the new file name during the file renaming process. This allows an attacker to rename uploaded files to malicious extensions. This suggests two weaknesses: **Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type** (CWE-434) and **External Control of File Name or Path** (CWE-73).\n\nThe relationship between CWE-434 and CWE-73 is that CWE-434 can precede CWE-73. That is, first an attacker uploads a file with a dangerous type, and then the attacker uses external control of filename or path to rename the file to a malicious extension.\n\nBased on the evidence available, the primary weakness is **Improper Access Control** (CWE-284), but since this is discouraged, the secondary CWEs CWE-434 and CWE-73 should also be considered.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
