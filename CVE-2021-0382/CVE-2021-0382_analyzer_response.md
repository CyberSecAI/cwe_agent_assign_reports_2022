# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2021-0382

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |
| CWE-732 | Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** (Class). It's related to CWE-285 **Improper Authorization** (Class) as a child. We also considered CWE-732 **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource** (Class) as a secondary CWE, but ultimately, the root cause is a missing authorization check, not an incorrect assignment. CWE-862 is a class-level CWE, but it accurately reflects the **missing** authorization check.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect permission check** in `checkSlicePermission` which results in local information disclosure. Thus the root cause is the **missing** or **incorrect** authorization, and the impact is local information disclosure.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified the **incorrect permission check** as the root cause. The vulnerability description key phrases clearly stated this. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating the removal of the `checkUriPermission` which simplifies the code. While the summary describes that this is a code cleanup, the vulnerability description states that there is a possible resource exposure due to an **incorrect permission check**.

The retriever results pointed to CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**, CWE-732 **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource**, and CWE-285 **Improper Authorization**.

CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** seems more appropriate than CWE-732 **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource** because the problem is a missing check rather than an incorrect assignment. The description states the **incorrect permission check**. While this could be an incorrect assignment, it is more about the **missing** authorization check.

The vulnerability is a class-level weakness that clearly reflects the **missing** authorization check that leads to local information disclosure.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-223: Omission of Security-relevant Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not record or display information that would be important for identifying the source or nature of an attack, or determining if an action is safe.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-927: Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 4469.21
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The Android application uses an implicit intent for transmitting sensitive data to other applications.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
