While CWE-77 is a more general class of command injection, CWE-78 specifically addresses OS command injection, which is the precise nature of the vulnerability described. The Retriever results also confirm that CWE-78 is the best match.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper input sanitization** of the `content.server` parameter, which leads directly to **OS Command Injection**, resulting in **Remote Code Execution**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the detailed vulnerability description and supporting evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The **lack of input sanitization** of the `content.server` parameter in the `add_server_service` function is the **root cause**, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands. The direct use of this unsanitized input in a `string.format` call used to construct a shell command confirms the presence of CWE-78.\n\nThe evidence includes:\n- \"The vulnerability stems from the **lack of proper input sanitization** of the `content.server` parameter\"\n- \"This parameter is directly incorporated into a shell command without sufficient validation or sanitization.\"\n- \"**Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. Since the `content.server` string is directly included in a `string.format` call used to construct a shell command, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands\"\n\nCWE-78 is selected because the vulnerability involves the construction of an OS command using externally-influenced input without proper neutralization of special elements. The impact is that an attacker can modify the intended OS command, leading to arbitrary command execution with root privileges. This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-78.\n\nCWE-77 was considered as a broader category of command injection, but CWE-78 is more specific and accurate because it directly involves OS commands.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
