CWE-78 is a more specific case of CWE-77, focusing on OS commands. Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"command injection,\" and the context suggests it involves OS commands, CWE-78 was chosen as the primary CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: OS Command Injection\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n    class cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the lack of proper input validation, leading to the ability to inject OS commands, which can then compromise the system.\n\nImproper Input Validation (CWE-20) -> OS Command Injection (CWE-78) -> System Compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified **command injection** as the core issue. The retriever results strongly suggested CWE-78 (OS Command Injection), and the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"command injection.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the vulnerability is a pre-authentication command injection flaw, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary commands into the system.\n\nThe graph relationships further support the selection of CWE-78, as it is a specific type of command injection that occurs at the OS level. The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" listed CWE-77 as the primary match, but the analysis determined CWE-78 to be more specific and accurate.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-78 directly addresses the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in OS commands, which aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description and the root cause analysis. The evidence from the advisory, combined with the relationship analysis and retriever results, provides strong support for this classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25

0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n-
