# Analysis for CVE-2020-18778

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-126 | Buffer Over-read | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-125 (**Out-of-bounds Read**), a Base level CWE. CWE-126 (**Buffer Over-read**) is considered as a secondary candidate, being a Variant of CWE-125. The "ChildOf" relationship between CWE-126 and CWE-125 indicates that CWE-126 is a more specific type of out-of-bounds read. However, based on the description "heap-based buffer over-read", CWE-125 is more appropriate as it describes the general condition while CWE-126 specifies the direction of the read (over).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain consists of a **heap-based buffer over-read** that leads to a denial-of-service.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly indicates a **heap-based buffer over-read** in Libav. The primary CWE, CWE-125 (**Out-of-bounds Read**), directly addresses this weakness. The description aligns with the CWE's definition of reading data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer.

The evidence for this selection is the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**, specifically:

*   **weakness:** **heap-based buffer over-read**
*   **impact:** denial-of-service

The selection of CWE-125 is also supported by the "CWE for similar CVE Descriptions" section, which lists CWE-125 as the "Primary CWE Match" and the most frequent CWE among similar vulnerabilities.

CWE-126 (**Buffer Over-read**) was considered as a secondary candidate because it is a variant of CWE-125. However, the vulnerability description simply states "over-read" and does not provide explicit evidence that the read occurs "after the targeted buffer," which is specific to CWE-126.

Other CWEs such as CWE-190 (**Integer Overflow or Wraparound**), CWE-193 (**Off-by-one Error**), and CWE-1284 (**Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input**) were considered but not selected because they do not directly relate to the **buffer over-read** condition described in the vulnerability. These CWEs represent different types of weaknesses that could potentially lead to out-of-bounds reads but are not the root cause in this case.
Specifically:
* CWE-190, CWE-193, CWE-1284 are related to integer manipulation and input validation respectively. Since the vulnerability description does not have any issues relating to these, they were not selected.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read

## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 5403.53
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to
