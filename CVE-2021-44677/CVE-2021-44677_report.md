# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-44677

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-502 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data | 1 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-923 | Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is that CWE-502 is a Base-level CWE, making it more specific than its parent classes. The relationship between CWE-502 and CWE-915 was noted for further exploration, but doesn't affect the primary mapping here. CWE-923 is related as a potential consequence of improper key exchange if that exchange lacks entity authentication, but is not the root cause itself.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **deserialization** of untrusted data (CWE-502) due to **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. This leads to remote code execution on the Enterprise Vault server. The use of .NET Remoting TCP ports exacerbates the issue, and **misconfigurations** of the firewall worsen it.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis, based on the vulnerability description, CVE reference links content summary, and retriever results, points strongly to CWE-502 as the primary weakness. The description clearly states that the vulnerability is due to **deserialization** behavior inherent to the .NET Remoting service. The CVE reference links content summary supports this, highlighting the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** and insecure **deserialization** as the root cause. The retriever results also list CWE-502 as the top match.

The following is the key supporting evidence:
*   "These TCP services can be exploited due to **deserialization** behavior that is inherent to the .NET Remoting service."
*   "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `EVExchangeWebServicesProxy.exe` component of Veritas Enterprise Vault. This leads to the deserialization of untrusted data."

CWE-923 "Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints" was considered because the description mentions that the Enterprise Vault application starts several services that listen on random .NET Remoting TCP ports. However, the root cause is the **deserialization** of untrusted data, not the improper restriction of the communication channel. Thus, it is a secondary contributing factor.

Based on the evidence and the hierarchical relationships, CWE-502 is the most specific and appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected as it is less descriptive of the root cause than CWE-502.*

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected as it is less descriptive of the root cause than CWE-502.*

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected as it is less descriptive of the root cause than CWE-502.*

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

*This CWE was not selected as it is a class level weakness.*

## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected as it is less descriptive of the root cause than CWE-502.*

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE was not selected as it is a class level weakness.*

## CWE-179: Incorrect Behavior Order: Early Validation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product validates input before applying protection mechanisms that modify the input, which could allow an attacker to bypass the validation via dangerous inputs that only arise after the modification.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected as it is less descriptive of the root cause than CWE-502.*

## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE was not selected as it is a class level weakness.*

## CWE-115: Misinterpretation of Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product misinterprets an input, whether from an attacker or another product, in a security-relevant fashion.

**Mapping Guidance**:
