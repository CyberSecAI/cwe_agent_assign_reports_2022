Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a \"stack-based buffer overflow\", using the more specific CWE-121 is appropriate instead of the more general CWE-787 or CWE-119.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: a **stack-based buffer overflow** (CWE-121) allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the explicit mention of \"**stack-based buffer overflow**\" in the vulnerability description and \"**Root cause of vulnerability: Stack-based buffer overflow.**\" in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The primary CWE match from the \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section is CWE-787, but given the explicit mention of 'stack-based,' the more specific CWE-121 is the better choice.\n\nThe selection of CWE-121 is at the optimal level of specificity because the vulnerability description clearly indicates that the buffer overflow occurs on the stack. This is a Variant level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. Other CWEs like CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) are too general.",
