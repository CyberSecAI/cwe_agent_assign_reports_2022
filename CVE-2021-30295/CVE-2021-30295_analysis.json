It is related to CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), as it is a child of CWE-119. CWE-1285, the secondary CWE, is related to CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) as it is a child of CWE-20. It represents the **improper validation of local variable** that led to the **heap overflow**. The chain of events is **improper validation** leading to out-of-bounds write.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe1285[\"CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe1285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe1285 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe1285 secondary\n    class cwe119,cwe20 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper validation of local variable** (CWE-1285) which leads to a **heap overflow** (CWE-787).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates a **heap overflow** due to **improper validation of local variable**.\nThe description states: \"Possible **heap overflow** due to **improper validation of local variable** while storing current task information locally in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Wearables\".\n\nThe primary weakness is CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), as the vulnerability results in a heap overflow, which means writing data outside the intended buffer. CWE-787 is a base-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nThe root cause of the vulnerability is **improper validation of local variable**, which maps to CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input). This is because the local variable likely represents an index, position, or offset that is not properly validated before being used, leading to the heap overflow. CWE-1285 is a base-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nCWE-190, CWE-126, CWE-367, CWE-822, and CWE-415 were considered but discarded. While CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) could be involved in calculating buffer sizes, the description explicitly mentions **improper validation**, making CWE-1285 a better fit. CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) is not applicable as the vulnerability is about writing, not reading, out of bounds. CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) is not relevant as there is no mention of race conditions. CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference) and CWE-415 (Double Free) don't align with the **improper validation** and **heap overflow** described in the vulnerability.",
