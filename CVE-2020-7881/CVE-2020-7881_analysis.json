CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, a class CWE. The relationship analysis shows a clear hierarchical structure, guiding the selection of the most specific CWE variant possible given the available information. CWE-120 is a peer of CWE-121 in that they both are caused by buffer overflows.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe120 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **stored data without validation of length**, leading to a **strcpy() operate by FanTicket field** which results in a **stack-based buffer overflow**, ultimately leading to remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis focuses on identifying the root cause and the specific type of buffer overflow. The vulnerability description clearly states that the **weakness** is a **stack-based buffer overflow** due to **strcpy() operate by FanTicket field** where the **vector** is **stored data without validation of length**. The retriever results also suggest CWE-121 as a potential match.\n\nCWE-121 is chosen as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a \"stack-based buffer overflow.\" This specificity aligns directly with the definition of CWE-121.\n\nCWE-120, \"Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\", was considered because the vulnerability involves `strcpy()`, a function often associated with classic buffer overflows where the size of the input is not checked before copying it to a buffer. However, CWE-121 is more specific since it identifies the location of the buffer on the stack.\n\nCWE-787 \"Out-of-bounds Write\" was considered because it is a more general case of buffer overflow, but it is also a parent of CWE-121.\n\nThe selection of CWE-121 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the \"stack-based\" nature of the buffer overflow as described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer,

mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-127: Buffer Under-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations

the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation to determine how much memory to allocate, but an integer overflow can occur that causes less memory to be allocated than expected, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a named chain, which combines multiple weaknesses.\n\n## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available. It also overlaps existing CWE entries and might be deprecated in the future.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6374.98\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to",
