The product **performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow** or wraparound when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. |\n| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 0.8 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The **integer overflow** caused a negative value to be used for memory allocation, which corrupted the heap, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **CWE-190 [Integer Overflow or Wraparound]**, which is a Base CWE. The integer overflow leads to **CWE-122 [Heap-based Buffer Overflow]**, a Variant CWE. CWE-190 can precede CWE-119 [Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer], a more general form of buffer overflow.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe190 --> cwe122\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Mishandling of continuation lines** in headers leads to an **integer overflow** (CWE-190).\n2.  The **integer overflow** results in memory corruption, specifically a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).\n3.  The buffer overflow enables remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is the **integer overflow** (CWE-190) due to the **mishandling of continuation lines** during header-length restriction. This leads to memory corruption, specifically a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122), enabling remote code execution.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description includes:\n*   \"Exim 4 before 4.92 allows Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow, in which an unauthenticated remote attacker can execute arbitrary code by leveraging the **mishandling of continuation lines** during header-length restriction.\"\n*   \"Integer overflow in the `header_size` variable within the `receive_msg()` function... This overflow occurs when processing overly large mail headers containing only continuation lines... `header_size *= 2;` without sufficient checks, leading to an integer overflow.\"\n*   \"The integer overflow leads to memory corruption by causing a negative value for header_size, which is then used for memory allocation (`store_get(header_size)`).\"\n\nBased on this evidence, CWE-190 is the most appropriate primary CWE, as it directly reflects the root cause. CWE-122 is a secondary CWE, representing the resulting heap-based buffer overflow. Both are at appropriate levels of abstraction (Base and Variant, respectively).\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-680 [Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow] was considered. However, this is a Compound CWE and the guidance discourages its use when the individual weaknesses can be mapped separately. Therefore, mapping to CWE-190 and CWE-122 is more precise.\n*   CWE-1284 [Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input] was considered, but the core issue is not the lack of input validation, but the integer overflow.\n*   CWE-119 [Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer] is too high-level. The more specific CWE-122 is more appropriate.",
