The secondary CWE, CWE-1220 **Insufficient Granularity of Access Control**, highlights the access control mechanism lacking the required granularity.

The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section clearly indicates that the issue lies in the **insufficient permissions checks**. This directly maps to CWE-274 **Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges**, as the application **does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation**. The \"Vulnerability Description\" also points to the **impact:** bypass Privacy preferences. This bypass is possible because of the **lack of granularity in the access control**, which is addressed by CWE-1220 **Insufficient Granularity of Access Control**.\n\nCWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write**, CWE-843 **Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')**, CWE-415 **Double Free**, CWE-123 **Write-what-where Condition**, CWE-125 **Out-of-bounds Read**, CWE-190 **Integer Overflow or Wraparound**, and CWE-22 **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** were considered but deemed less relevant as they describe different types of vulnerabilities that do not directly align with the described weakness. CWE-277 **Insecure Inherited Permissions** was considered but did not accurately reflect the vulnerability, as the issue is not with insecure permissions being inherited but rather with the handling of insufficient privileges at runtime. CWE-665 **Improper Initialization** and CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation** were deemed too general. CWE-347 **Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature** was not relevant because there was no mention of cryptographic signatures in the vulnerability description. CWE-1263 **Improper Physical Access Control** was not relevant because the attack vector was a malicious application, not physical access.\nCWE-1289, CWE-807, CWE-653, CWE-657, CWE-404, CWE-1220, CWE-183, CWE-345, CWE-1284, CWE-367, CWE-1341, CWE-770, CWE-416, and CWE-825 were also considered but did not fit the vulnerability as well as CWE-274 and CWE-1220.\n\nCWE-274 and CWE-1220 are at the optimal level of specificity, as they directly address the root cause of the vulnerability based on the available evidence.",
