The Retriever Results also suggest CWE-77 as a candidate, and it is the parent of CWE-78, but it is too high level. CWE-184 is also a candidate because the exploit bypasses restrictions on character usage (spaces, forward slashes, etc.) using techniques like manipulating the Internal Field Separator (IFS) and using `xxd` to represent restricted characters which shows the list of disallowed inputs is incomplete.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n    class cwe184 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient input validation** which leads to **command injection** and the ability to **execute commands**. The incomplete list of disallowed inputs allowed the attacker to bypass restrictions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis concludes that the primary weakness is CWE-78. The vulnerability description states that it is possible for an authenticated attacker to **inject commands** via `file_name` in the export functionality. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** section provides strong evidence to support this conclusion. Specifically, it states: \"The application is vulnerable to **command injection** via the `file_name` parameter\" and \"The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `file_name` parameter, allowing attackers to **inject arbitrary shell commands**.\" This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-78, which involves the improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. The vulnerability allows for remote code execution due to the ability to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the server.\n\nCWE-77 was considered but deemed less specific than CWE-78. While CWE-77 covers command injection in general, CWE-78 is specific to OS commands, which is the case in this vulnerability.\n\nCWE-184 was considered because the attacker was able to bypass some input validation, but that is not the primary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n```\n## Vulnerability Description\nIn Ericsson Network Location before 2021-07-31, it is possible for an authenticated attacker to inject commands via file_name in the export functionality. For example, a new admin user could be created.\n```\n\n```\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability lies within the \"export\" feature of the Ericsson Network Location Mobile Positioning Systems (MPS) web application. Specifically, the `file_name` parameter in the export functionality is vulnerable to command injection. This parameter is used to create files on the server, and it's not properly sanitized.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Command Injection:** The application is vulnerable to command injection via the `file_name` parameter.\n*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `file_name` parameter, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary shell commands.\n```",
