| CWE-1193 | Power-On of Untrusted Execution Core Before Enabling Fabric Access Control | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-1193, is a Base level CWE, providing a specific description of the vulnerability. It is a ChildOf CWE-696 (Incorrect Behavior Order). This hierarchical relationship indicates that the vulnerability is a specific instance of a broader class of issues related to the order of operations. There are no chain relationships for this CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events for this vulnerability starts with the **root cause**: the **lacking security access configuration for wakeup-related registers**. This leads to the ability of the NonSecure World to perform arbitrary memory read/write operations on Secure World memory, resulting in a TrustZone bypass. The chain is:

1.  **Improper configuration**: **lacking security access configuration for wakeup-related registers** (CWE-1193)
2.  **Vulnerability**: The NonSecure World can perform arbitrary memory read/write operations on Secure World memory.
3.  **Impact**: TrustZone bypass

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the **root cause** identified in the vulnerability description: **lacking security access configuration for wakeup-related registers**. The Retriever Results pointed to several potential CWEs, but CWE-1193 stood out as the most relevant due to its specific focus on the power-on sequence of untrusted execution cores before enabling fabric access control.

The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary directly supports this mapping. The vulnerability stems from the OP-TEE OS CSU driver incorrectly configuring the Security Access (SA) policy, allowing the Normal World OS to set the System Reset Controller (SRC) wakeup pointers, which causes the system to boot into the Secure World even if the system was in a non-secure context before sleeping. This aligns perfectly with CWE-1193's description of enabling untrusted components before security features are programmed.

The graph relationships reinforce this selection, as CWE-1193 is a specific instance of a broader class of issues related to the order of operations (CWE-696). This level of specificity is crucial for accurately representing the vulnerability.

Therefore, CWE-1193 is the most appropriate CWE because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the **improper power-on sequence that allows an untrusted execution core to operate before fabric access controls are enabled**. This selection is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description, supported by the Retriever Results, and reinforced by the graph relationships.
