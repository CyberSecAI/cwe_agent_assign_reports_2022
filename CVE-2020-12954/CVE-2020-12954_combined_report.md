## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **side effect of an integrated chipset option** leading to the **impact** of bypassing SPI ROM protections.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided evidence, particularly the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" and "CVE Reference Links Content Summary." The key phrase "side effect of an integrated chipset option" points to a mechanism that should not have been accessible or have led to unauthorized modification. The impact "bypass SPI ROM protections" indicates a **failure** in the protection mechanism.

CWE-1299 (Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface) is the most appropriate because it addresses the root cause: the **lack of protections** on an alternate path (the **side effect of the integrated chipset option**) allowing an attacker to bypass intended protections on the SPI ROM. This is a base-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The CVE description mentions "A **side effect of an integrated chipset option** can be used by an attacker to bypass SPI ROM protections, allowing unauthorized SPI ROM modification." The description for CWE-1299 states "The lack of protections on alternate paths to access control-protected assets ... allows an attacker to bypass existing protections."

CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure) was considered but is too general (Pillar level). While it's true that a protection mechanism failed, CWE-1299 provides a more specific explanation of how the bypass occurred.

CWE-1191 (On-Chip Debug and Test Interface With Improper Access Control) was also considered but is less relevant. While it relates to hardware interfaces, the vulnerability description doesn't specifically mention a debug or test interface.

The final selection of CWE-1299 is based on its accurate representation of the vulnerability's root cause, its appropriate level of specificity (Base), and the MITRE mapping guidance that allows its use.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure
**Abstraction:** Pillar
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not use or incorrectly uses a protection mechanism that provides sufficient defense against directed attacks against the product.

### Extended Description
This weakness covers three distinct situations. A "missing" protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An "insufficient" protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example, against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally, an "ignored" mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product, but the developer has not applied it in some code path.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
None

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.
**Comments:** Consider children or descendants of this entry instead.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Research Gap]** The concept of protection mechanisms is well established, but protection mechanism failures have not been studied comprehensively. It is suspected that protection mechanisms can have significantly different types of weaknesses than the weaknesses that they are intended to prevent.






## CWE-1233: Security-Sensitive Hardware Controls with Missing Lock Bit Protection
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses a register lock bit protection mechanism, but it does not ensure that the lock bit prevents modification of system registers or controls that perform changes to important hardware system configuration.

### Extended Description


Integrated circuits and hardware intellectual properties (IPs) might provide device configuration controls that need to be programmed after device power reset by a trusted firmware or software module, commonly set by BIOS/bootloader. After reset, there can be an expectation that the controls cannot be used to perform any further modification. This behavior is commonly implemented using a trusted lock bit, which can be set to disable writes to a protected set of registers or address regions. The lock protection is intended to prevent modification of certain system configuration (e.g., memory/memory protection unit configuration).


However, if the lock bit does not effectively write-protect all system registers or controls that could modify the protected system configuration, then an adversary may be able to use software to access the registers/controls and modify the protected hardware configuration.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2018-9085:** Certain servers leave a write protection lock bit unset after boot, potentially allowing modification of parts of flash memory.
- **CVE-2014-8273:** Chain: chipset has a race condition (CWE-362) between when an interrupt handler detects an attempt to write-enable the BIOS (in violation of the lock bit), and when the handler resets the write-enable bit back to 0, allowing attackers to issue BIOS writes during the timing window [REF-1237].




## CWE-1191: On-Chip Debug and Test Interface With Improper Access Control
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The chip does not implement or does not correctly perform access control to check whether users are authorized to access internal registers and test modes through the physical debug/test interface.

### Extended Description


A device's internal information may be accessed through a scan chain of interconnected internal registers, usually through a JTAG interface. The JTAG interface provides access to these registers in a serial fashion in the form of a scan chain for the purposes of debugging programs running on a device. Since almost all information contained within a device may be accessed over this interface, device manufacturers typically insert some form of authentication and authorization to prevent unintended use of this sensitive information. This mechanism is implemented in addition to on-chip protections that are already present.


If authorization, authentication, or some other form of access control is not implemented or not implemented correctly, a user may be able to bypass on-chip protection mechanisms through the debug interface.


Sometimes, designers choose not to expose the debug pins on the motherboard. Instead, they choose to hide these pins in the intermediate layers of the board. This is primarily done to work around the lack of debug authorization inside the chip. In such a scenario (without debug authorization), when the debug interface is exposed, chip internals are accessible to an attacker.

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** CWE-1191 and CWE-1244 both involve physical debug access, but the weaknesses are different. CWE-1191 is effectively about missing authorization for a debug interface, i.e. JTAG. CWE-1244 is about providing internal assets with the wrong debug access level, exposing the asset to untrusted debug agents.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-18827:** chain: JTAG interface is not disabled (CWE-1191) during ROM code execution, introducing a race condition (CWE-362) to extract encryption keys




## CWE-912: Hidden Functionality
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product contains functionality that is not documented, not part of the specification, and not accessible through an interface or command sequence that is obvious to the product's users or administrators.

### Extended Description
Hidden functionality can take many forms, such as intentionally malicious code, "Easter Eggs" that contain extraneous functionality such as games, developer-friendly shortcuts that reduce maintenance or support costs such as hard-coded accounts, etc. From a security perspective, even when the functionality is not intentionally malicious or damaging, it can increase the product's attack surface and expose additional weaknesses beyond what is already exposed by the intended functionality. Even if it is not easily accessible, the hidden functionality could be useful for attacks that modify the control flow of the application.

- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)
- **CVE-2022-3203:** A wireless access point manual specifies that the only method of configuration is via web interface (CWE-1059), but there is an undisclosed telnet server that was activated by default (CWE-912).




## CWE-1278: Missing Protection Against Hardware Reverse Engineering Using Integrated Circuit (IC) Imaging Techniques
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Information stored in hardware may be recovered by an attacker with the capability to capture and analyze images of the integrated circuit using techniques such as scanning electron microscopy.

### Extended Description


The physical structure of a device, viewed at high enough magnification, can reveal the information stored inside. Typical steps in IC reverse engineering involve removing the chip packaging (decapsulation) then using various imaging techniques ranging from high resolution x-ray microscopy to invasive techniques involving removing IC layers and imaging each layer using a scanning electron microscope.


The goal of such activities is to recover secret keys, unique device identifiers, and proprietary code and circuit designs embedded in hardware that the attacker has been unsuccessful at accessing through other means. These secrets may be stored in non-volatile memory or in the circuit netlist. Memory technologies such as masked ROM allow easier to extraction of secrets than One-time Programmable (OTP) memory.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements. It is more attack-oriented, so it might be more suited for CAPEC.






## CWE-1310: Missing Ability to Patch ROM Code
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
Missing an ability to patch ROM code may leave a System or System-on-Chip (SoC) in a vulnerable state.

### Extended Description


A System or System-on-Chip (SoC) that implements a boot process utilizing security mechanisms such as Root-of-Trust (RoT) typically starts by executing code from a Read-only-Memory (ROM) component. The code in ROM is immutable, hence any security vulnerabilities discovered in the ROM code can never be fixed for the systems that are already in use.


A common weakness is that the ROM does not have the ability to patch if security vulnerabilities are uncovered after the system gets shipped. This leaves the system in a vulnerable state where an adversary can compromise the SoC.

## CWE-1299: Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The lack of protections on alternate paths to access
                control-protected assets (such as unprotected shadow registers
                and other external facing unguarded interfaces) allows an
                attacker to bypass existing protections to the asset that are
		only performed against the primary path.

### Extended Description


An asset inside a chip might have access-control protections through one interface. However, if all paths to the asset are not protected, an attacker might compromise the asset through alternate paths. These alternate paths could be through shadow or mirror registers inside the IP core, or could be paths from other external-facing interfaces to the IP core or SoC.


Consider an SoC with various interfaces such as UART, SMBUS, PCIe, USB, etc. If access control is implemented for SoC internal registers only over the PCIe interface, then an attacker could still modify the SoC internal registers through alternate paths by coming through interfaces such as UART, SMBUS, USB, etc. 


Alternatively, attackers might be able to bypass existing protections by exploiting unprotected, shadow registers. Shadow registers and mirror registers typically refer to registers that can be accessed from multiple addresses. Writing to or reading from the aliased/mirrored address has the same effect as writing to the address of the main register. They are typically implemented within an IP core or SoC to temporarily hold certain data. These data will later be updated to the main register, and both registers will be in synch. If the shadow registers are not access-protected, attackers could simply initiate transactions to the shadow registers and compromise system security.

- **CVE-2022-38399:** Missing protection mechanism on serial connection allows for arbitrary OS command execution.
- **CVE-2020-9285:** Mini-PCI Express slot does not restrict direct memory access.
- **CVE-2020-8004:** When the internal flash is protected by blocking access on the Data Bus (DBUS), it can still be indirectly accessed through the Instruction Bus (IBUS).




## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** "origin validation" could fall under this.

**[Maintenance]** The specific ways in which the origin is not properly identified should be laid out as separate weaknesses. In some sense, this is more like a category.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30260:** Distributed Control System (DCS) does not sign firmware images and only relies on insecure checksums for integrity checks
- **CVE-2022-30267:** Distributed Control System (DCS) does not sign firmware images and only relies on insecure checksums for integrity checks
- **CVE-2022-30272:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) does not use signatures for firmware images and relies on insecure checksums




## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

### Extended Description


Resources such as files and directories may be inadvertently exposed through mechanisms such as insecure permissions, or when a program accidentally operates on the wrong object. For example, a program may intend that private files can only be provided to a specific user. This effectively defines a control sphere that is intended to prevent attackers from accessing these private files. If the file permissions are insecure, then parties other than the user will be able to access those files.


A separate control sphere might effectively require that the user can only access the private files, but not any other files on the system. If the program does not ensure that the user is only requesting private files, then the user might be able to access other files on the system.


In either case, the end result is that a resource has been exposed to the wrong party.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** A "control sphere" is a set of resources and behaviors that are accessible to a single actor, or a group of actors. A product's security model will typically define multiple spheres, possibly implicitly. For example, a server might define one sphere for "administrators" who can create new user accounts with subdirectories under /home/server/, and a second sphere might cover the set of users who can create or delete files within their own subdirectories. A third sphere might be "users who are authenticated to the operating system on which the product is installed." Each sphere has different sets of actors and allowable behaviors.






## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

### Extended Description


If a web product does not properly protect assumed-immutable values from modification in hidden form fields, parameters, cookies, or URLs, this can lead to modification of critical data. Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.


For example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is a primary weakness for many other weaknesses and functional consequences, including XSS, SQL injection, path disclosure, and file inclusion.

**[Theoretical]** This is a technology-specific MAID problem.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-0108:** Forum product allows spoofed messages of other users via hidden form fields for name and e-mail address.
- **CVE-2000-0253:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.
