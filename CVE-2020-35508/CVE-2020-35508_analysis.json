CWE-362 is a Class-level CWE, and it has a child CWE-367 \"Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\" which is a Base-level CWE. However, the description does not indicate the TOCTOU condition specifically. The secondary weakness is **incorrect initialization of process id**, which maps to CWE-909 \"Missing Initialization of Resource\". CWE-909 is a Class-level CWE, and is a child of CWE-665 \"Improper Initialization\". The relationship to CWE-665 is not explicit, so the Class-level CWE-909 is appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe665[\"CWE-665: Improper Initialization\"]\n    cwe909[\"CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\"]\n\n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe909 -->|CHILDOF| cwe665\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe909 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition and incorrect initialization of the process id** in the Linux kernel's child/parent process identification handling. This allows a local attacker to **bypass checks to send any signal to a privileged process**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description highlights two issues: a **race condition and incorrect initialization of the process id**.\n\nThe **race condition** maps directly to CWE-362 \"Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\". The vulnerability description states: \"A flaw possibility of **race condition**... was found in the Linux kernel child/parent process identification handling while filtering signal handlers.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"The root cause is a **race condition** during process creation when using `CLONE_PARENT` flag in the `copy_process` function.\" This makes CWE-362 a strong primary candidate.\n\nThe **incorrect initialization of the process id** maps to CWE-909 \"Missing Initialization of Resource\".
