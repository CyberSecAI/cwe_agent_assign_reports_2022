## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**. This is a Class-level CWE, and the description and observed examples align well with the vulnerability. The parent CWEs are CWE-285 **Improper Authorization** and CWE-284 **Improper Access Control**. While a more specific Base or Variant CWE would be ideal, the available information doesn't support a more granular mapping. There are no clear chain relationships evident in this particular case. The retriever results suggested related issues such as initialization problems and UI misrepresentation, but these are not directly applicable based on the information.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is straightforward:
1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**: The MediaProvider component lacks a permission check.
2.  **Impact:** Unauthorized access to media provider collections.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on the **missing permission check** as the root cause. The analysis of the CVE reference links content summary confirmed that the MediaProvider incorrectly grants global access because of the **missing permission check**, leading to privilege escalation.

The retriever results and complete CWE specifications were then examined. CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** emerged as the most suitable option. While it is a Class-level CWE, the evidence strongly supports it, and the MITRE mapping guidance allows for its use with review, especially when a more specific child CWE is not evident.

The decision is heavily based on the vulnerability description's key phrases and the CVE reference link content summary, which explicitly mentions the **missing permission check**.

The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity given the available information. Although more specific CWEs exist under **Improper Authorization**, there's no evidence to suggest that the authorization check was performed incorrectly; it was simply missing.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-39662

## Vulnerability Description
In checkUriPermission of MediaProvider.java , there is a possible way to gain access to the content of media provider collections due to a **missing permission check**. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product AndroidVersions Android-11 Android-12Android ID A-197302116

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **missing permission check**
- **impact:** gain access to content of media provider collections
- **product:** Android
- **version:** 11, 12
- **component:** checkUriPermission of MediaProvider.java

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39662:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the MediaProvider handles content URIs without an ID. When an app is granted access to a single file within a collection (e.g., Audio, Downloads, Files, Images, or Videos) and requests URI access using `FLAG_GRANT_PREFIX_URI_PERMISSION` on a content URI to the collection, it can gain read and write access to all files in that collection without additional permissions. This is because the MediaProvider incorrectly grants global access based on a URI without an ID, instead of limiting access to only the specific file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect permission handling:** The MediaProvider doesn't properly validate the scope of URI permissions, leading to overly broad access.
- **Unintended privilege escalation:** An app with access to one file can escalate its privileges to access all files within the same collection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized data access:** An attacker could read or modify any file within a media collection on the device, leading to data breaches, tampering, or denial of service.
- **Local escalation of privilege:** The attacker gains access to data they would otherwise not be authorized to access.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious app that gains access to a single file.
- The app then uses this access to request URI permission with `FLAG_GRANT_PREFIX_URI_PERMISSION` on a content URI to the collection, in order to access all files within the collection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an app installed on the target device.
- The app must be able to get access to at least one file in a media collection by some means.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix prevents the app from getting global access when it is granted a read UriPermission on a URI without an ID. It now returns the same query result as if the read UriPermission was not granted.
- The vulnerability affects Android versions 11 and 12.
- The fix is identified by AOSP change ID: `Id6349b7b49cf682c6703333bc96f1b7046b7700e` and bug ID `197302116`.

- **CVE-2000-0542:** Failed authentication attempts are not recorded if later attempt succeeds.




## CWE-927: Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The Android application uses an implicit intent for transmitting sensitive data to other applications.

### Extended Description


Since an implicit intent does not specify a particular application to receive the data, any application can process the intent by using an Intent Filter for that intent. This can allow untrusted applications to obtain sensitive data. There are two variations on the standard broadcast intent, ordered and sticky.


Ordered broadcast intents are delivered to a series of registered receivers in order of priority as declared by the Receivers. A malicious receiver can give itself a high priority and cause a denial of service by stopping the broadcast from propagating further down the chain. There is also the possibility of malicious data modification, as a receiver may also alter the data within the Intent before passing it on to the next receiver. The downstream components have no way of asserting that the data has not been altered earlier in the chain.


Sticky broadcast intents remain accessible after the initial broadcast. An old sticky intent will be broadcast again to any new receivers that register for it in the future, greatly increasing the chances of information exposure over time. Also, sticky broadcasts cannot be protected by permissions that may apply to other kinds of intents.


In addition, any broadcast intent may include a URI that references data that the receiving component does not normally have the privileges to access. The sender of the intent can include special privileges that grant the receiver read or write access to the specific URI included in the intent. A malicious receiver that intercepts this intent will also gain those privileges and be able to read or write the resource at the specified URI.

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-4903:** An Android application does not use FLAG_IMMUTABLE when creating a PendingIntent.




## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.

### Extended Description
When a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which "permissions" are not checked, which is an "authorization" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure "Everyone: Full Control" permissions for files under the "Program Files" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.
- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.




## CWE-925: Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The Android application uses a Broadcast Receiver that receives an Intent but does not properly verify that the Intent came from an authorized source.

### Extended Description
Certain types of Intents, identified by action string, can only be broadcast by the operating system itself, not by third-party applications. However, when an application registers to receive these implicit system intents, it is also registered to receive any explicit intents. While a malicious application cannot send an implicit system intent, it can send an explicit intent to the target application, which may assume that any received intent is a valid implicit system intent and not an explicit intent from another application. This may lead to unintended behavior.

### Alternative Terms
Intent Spoofing

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-940

- **CVE-2008-3637:** Improper error checking in protection mechanism produces an uninitialized variable, allowing security bypass and code execution.
- **CVE-2008-4197:** Use of uninitialized memory may allow code execution.




## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

### Extended Description


Locking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice
- **CVE-2010-4210:** function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.
