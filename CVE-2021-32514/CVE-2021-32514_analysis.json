Due to its high-level nature, it's generally discouraged. The analysis also considered its child CWEs, CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), for more specific classifications.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe862,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with an **improper access control** vulnerability. This leads to remote attackers being able to reboot and discontinue the device.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis points to **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)** due to the vulnerability description explicitly stating \"**Improper access control** vulnerability\". However, CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar and is discouraged. Therefore, the analysis also considered more specific child CWEs such as CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). Without more information, it is difficult to determine if authorization is completely missing or if it is incorrectly implemented. Both are plausible given the description.\n\nThe evidence is directly from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which states \"**rootcause: Improper access control**\".\n\nThe final decision is to include CWE-284 as the primary because that is what is explicitly stated in the description of the vulnerability. It will be noted that this is discouraged for mapping. The other two CWEs will be included as secondary candidates because there is not enough information to differentiate between the two.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of
