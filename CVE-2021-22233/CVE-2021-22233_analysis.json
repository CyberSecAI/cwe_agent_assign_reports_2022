CWE-862 is a more specific child of CWE-285, and the vulnerability description clearly indicates a **missing** authorization check, making CWE-862 the more appropriate choice. CWE-201 can follow CWE-862 in a chain, where missing authorization leads to the exposure of sensitive data.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe201\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n    class cwe285 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing** authorization check (CWE-862) in the `IdeController.project` method, which then leads to the unauthorized disclosure of project details (CWE-201). The root cause is the **lack of** proper authorization, resulting in the impact of information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered several CWEs, including CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). However, after reviewing the evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" it became clear that the **root cause** was a **missing** authorization check rather than an incorrect one. Specifically, the vulnerability description states: \"The `IdeController.project` method **does not check permissions** when searching for a project by its full path.\" This directly supports the selection of CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).\n\nThe graph relationships also influenced the selection, as CWE-862 is a child of CWE-285, making it a more specific and appropriate choice. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" highlighted the **impact** as information disclosure, suggesting a potential secondary CWE related to information exposure. CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) was considered as the secondary CWE because the unauthorized project details are being disclosed.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the **root cause** (missing authorization) and the resulting **impact** (information disclosure) of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
