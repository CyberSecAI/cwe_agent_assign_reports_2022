The vulnerability indicates that a blocked user should not have access to SpecialResetTokens, and the fact that they do have access indicates a failure in the privilege management. CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization and CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key were also considered as secondary issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe267[\"CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\"]\n\n    cwe267 -->|CHILDOF| cwe269\n    cwe863 -->|PEEROF| cwe269\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe269 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper privilege management**, leading to **unauthorized access** for blocked users, and ultimately resulting in the **inability to block potential future use of compromised tokens**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the fact that a blocked user was **unable to use SpecialResetTokens** which has security relevance because the user is not able to block potential future use of the token. The **root cause** is that the blocked user is **unable to use SpecialResetTokens**. The inability of blocked users to use SpecialResetTokens suggests a problem with access control.\n\nThe analysis considered CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) as possibilities, but ultimately settled on CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) as the primary weakness because the core issue is that a blocked user (with limited privileges) is not able to perform an action that they should be able to perform in certain circumstances (compromised token).\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"Blocked users are **unable to use SpecialResetTokens**. This has security relevance because a blocked user might have accidentally shared a token, or might know that a token has been compromised, and yet is not able to block any potential future use of the token by an unauthorized party.\" The phrase \"**unable to use SpecialResetTokens**\" indicates a privilege management issue, where the blocked user is being improperly restricted.\n\nThe final decision is based on the provided evidence and the relationships between the considered CWEs. CWE-269 is at the optimal level of specificity, representing the core weakness in privilege management that leads to the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n- Not Applicable: This CWE is not related to the **rootcause** of **unable to use SpecialResetTokens**.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n- Not Applicable: This CWE is not related to the **rootcause** of **unable to use SpecialResetTokens**.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n- Not Applicable: This CWE is not related to the **rootcause** of **unable to use SpecialResetTokens**.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n- Not Applicable: This CWE is not related to the **rootcause** of **unable to use SpecialResetTokens**.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n- Not Applicable: This CWE is not related to the **rootcause** of **unable to use SpecialResetTokens**.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n- Partially Applicable: A blocked user is prevented from using SpecialResetTokens, which is related to authorization.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n- Not Applicable: This CWE is not related to the **rootcause** of **unable to use SpecialResetTokens**.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n- Not Applicable: This CWE is not related to the **rootcause** of **unable to use SpecialResetTokens**.\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non",
