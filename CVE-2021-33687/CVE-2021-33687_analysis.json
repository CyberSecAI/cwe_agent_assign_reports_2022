The application is **inserting sensitive information** (HTTP request headers) into data that is sent (HTML body of the response). |\n| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. An attacker can use this in conjunction with other attacks such as XSS to steal this information. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-201, which indicates that sensitive information is being inserted into sent data. This is directly supported by the description that HTTP request headers are exposed in the HTML body. CWE-201 is a child of CWE-200, but CWE-201 is more specific.\n\nCWE-79 is a secondary weakness because the attacker can use this vulnerability in conjunction with other attacks such as XSS to steal this information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe79 -->|PeerOf| cwe201\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insertion of sensitive information** into the HTML body (CWE-201). The impact is that an attacker can use this information in conjunction with other attacks such as XSS (CWE-79) to steal this information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability was analyzed based on the description which states that sensitive information is revealed in HTTP requests. The core issue is that sensitive data (HTTP request headers) is being **inserted** into the HTML response, making it accessible in a way it shouldn't be. The analysis is heavily based on the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which provides clear evidence of the **root cause** and the specific mechanism of the vulnerability.\n\nThe retriever results and complete CWE specifications were then reviewed. CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) was identified as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the core issue of sensitive information being included in the sent data. The CWE description states, \"The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor,\" which aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) was considered as a secondary CWE since the vulnerability description mentioned the attacker can use this in conjunction with other attacks such as XSS to steal this information.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the weakness and mechanism described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a",
