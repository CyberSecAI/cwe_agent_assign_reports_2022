It is a child of CWE-522, Insufficiently Protected Credentials, which is a Class level CWE. CWE-798 is also considered, and is related to CWE-256. The selection of CWE-256 is based on the specific detail of **plaintext storage**, making it more precise than its parent class.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe256 -->|PEEROF| cwe798\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **plaintext storage** of secrets (CWE-256), leading to the ability to create valid JWT tokens, which in turn allows an attacker to impersonate users and manipulate RabbitMQ queues.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-256 (**Plaintext Storage of a Password**) due to the explicit mention of \"plaintext storage\" in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The vulnerability description states that an attacker with physical access can extract secrets from the registry. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the **root cause** of the vulnerability is the **plaintext storage of a password**.\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-256 as the top combined result.\n\nCWE-522 (**Insufficiently Protected Credentials**) was considered as a broader classification since plaintext storage falls under the umbrella of insufficiently protected credentials. However, CWE-256 is more specific and accurately reflects the core issue.\n\nCWE-798 (**Use of Hard-coded Credentials**) was also considered, but the evidence explicitly mentions the **plaintext storage** of secrets, rather than the credentials being hard-coded.\n\nThe final decision to prioritize CWE-256 is based on the direct evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary and its specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
