CWE-260 [Password in Configuration File] is also a child of CWE-522. The vulnerability involves storing a password in plaintext, which directly aligns with CWE-256. CWE-260 is also relevant because the plaintext password exists in the configuration file.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe260[\"CWE-260: Password in Configuration File\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe260 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe256 -->|PEEROF| cwe312\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe260,cwe312,cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: The **rootcause** is the **unencrypted storage of sensitive information** (CWE-256), which leads to the **impact** of being able to **view password** by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-256 as the primary weakness because the vulnerability description clearly states that the password is stored **unencrypted in the global config.xml file**. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-256, which is \"Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this: \"The VMware Lab Manager Slaves Plugin stores the password in plain text within the global `config.xml` file.\" The retriever results also list CWE-256 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-260 [Password in Configuration File] was also considered, and included since the password was stored in the config.xml file.\n\nCWE-312 [Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information] was also considered, since storing a password unencrypted, means it's stored in cleartext.\n\nCWE-522 [Insufficiently Protected Credentials] is a higher-level class that encompasses the specific issue of plaintext storage. While relevant, CWE-256 provides a more precise description of the vulnerability. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-522 suggests examining its children for a better fit, reinforcing the selection of CWE-256.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence that the password is being stored in plaintext. CWE-256 accurately captures this specific weakness and is at the optimal level of specificity (Base).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified
