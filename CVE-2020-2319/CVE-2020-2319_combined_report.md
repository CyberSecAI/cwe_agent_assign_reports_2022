## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain is straightforward: The **rootcause** is the **unencrypted storage of sensitive information** (CWE-256), which leads to the **impact** of being able to **view password** by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

## Summary of Analysis

The initial analysis identified CWE-256 as the primary weakness because the vulnerability description clearly states that the password is stored **unencrypted in the global config.xml file**. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-256, which is "Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise." The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms this: "The VMware Lab Manager Slaves Plugin stores the password in plain text within the global `config.xml` file." The retriever results also list CWE-256 as the top candidate.

CWE-260 [Password in Configuration File] was also considered, and included since the password was stored in the config.xml file.

CWE-312 [Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information] was also considered, since storing a password unencrypted, means it's stored in cleartext.

CWE-522 [Insufficiently Protected Credentials] is a higher-level class that encompasses the specific issue of plaintext storage. While relevant, CWE-256 provides a more precise description of the vulnerability. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-522 suggests examining its children for a better fit, reinforcing the selection of CWE-256.

The final decision is based on the evidence that the password is being stored in plaintext. CWE-256 accurately captures this specific weakness and is at the optimal level of specificity (Base).

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

### Extended Description


Because the information is stored in cleartext (i.e., unencrypted), attackers could potentially read it. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.


When organizations adopt cloud services, it can be easier for attackers to access the data from anywhere on the Internet.


In some systems/environments such as cloud, the use of "double encryption" (at both the software and hardware layer) might be required, and the developer might be solely responsible for both layers, instead of shared responsibility with the administrator of the broader system/environment.

ChildOf -> CWE-311
ChildOf -> CWE-922

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Different people use "cleartext" and "plaintext" to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.
- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie
- **CVE-2009-1466:** password stored in cleartext in a file with insecure permissions

**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
