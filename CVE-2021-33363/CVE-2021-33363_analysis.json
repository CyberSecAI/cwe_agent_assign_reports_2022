This indicates a specific type of memory management failure, making it a precise fit for the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe772[\"CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    \n    cwe401 -->|CHILDOF| cwe772\n    cwe401 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe401 primary\n    class cwe772,cwe404 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a logic error in the `infe_box_read` function, leading to a **memory leak**, and ultimately causing a denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed to CWE-401 due to the explicit mention of a **\"memory leak\"** in the vulnerability description. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirmed that the **root cause** was indeed a failure to release allocated memory, specifically when both `content_type` and `content_encoding` are present in the input stream. This evidence aligns perfectly with the CWE-401 description: \"The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used.\"\n\nThe retriever results also strongly supported CWE-401 as the best match, with a score of 1.0. The relationship analysis further solidified this decision, as CWE-401 is a Variant of more general resource management issues.\nThe evidence provided in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" specifically mentions: \"When both `content_type` and `content_encoding` are present in the input stream, only the memory allocated for `content_type` is freed. If a second `infe` box appears within the first, then the memory associated with the `content_encoding` is leaked.\" This statement directly supports the selection of CWE-401, as it clearly indicates a failure to release allocated memory.\n\nCWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) was considered but rejected because the vulnerability's **root cause** is a memory leak, not an out-of-bounds read. Similarly, other CWEs like CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) were deemed irrelevant because they don't align with the described weakness.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity (Variant) because it precisely describes the **memory leak** issue, providing a more accurate representation of the vulnerability than its parent classes.",
