It has a hierarchical relationship with CWE-285 Improper Authorization and CWE-284 Improper Access Control. CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource is a class-level CWE with parent relationships to CWE-285 and CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere. The vulnerability involves a **missing permission check**, which directly aligns with CWE-862. Since there's no base or variant level with the words 'missing permission check', CWE-862 is the best match.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe732,cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862), leading to potential information disclosure.\nMissing Permission Check (CWE-862) -> Information Disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is a **missing permission check**, which directly leads to information disclosure.\nThe analysis is based on the following evidence from the vulnerability description: \"In netdiag, there is a possible information disclosure due to a **missing permission check**.\"\nCWE-862 is the most appropriate because the description explicitly states a **missing permission check**.\nCWE-732 was considered because the **missing permission check** might result in incorrect permission assignments, but CWE-862 is the more direct cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-862: Directly reflects the **missing permission check**.\n- CWE-732: Could be related to incorrect permissions being set due to the **missing permission check**.\n- Other CWEs considered were not directly related to the root cause described.",
