## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862), leading to potential information disclosure.
Missing Permission Check (CWE-862) -> Information Disclosure

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is a **missing permission check**, which directly leads to information disclosure.
The analysis is based on the following evidence from the vulnerability description: "In netdiag, there is a possible information disclosure due to a **missing permission check**."
CWE-862 is the most appropriate because the description explicitly states a **missing permission check**.
CWE-732 was considered because the **missing permission check** might result in incorrect permission assignments, but CWE-862 is the more direct cause.

Relevant CWE Information:
- CWE-862: Directly reflects the **missing permission check**.
- CWE-732: Could be related to incorrect permissions being set due to the **missing permission check**.
- Other CWEs considered were not directly related to the root cause described.
