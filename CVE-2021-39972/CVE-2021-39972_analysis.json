While CWE-200 is a broader category, it aligns with the general description of sensitive information exposure. However, considering the potential for system-level information exposure, CWE-497 is considered as a possible secondary mapping because it is a child of CWE-200 and provides more specific details of the exposure. The abstraction levels guided the preference for the Base level (CWE-497) when applicable, but the description is vague.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the following:\n  - **ROOT CAUSE:** Inadequate protection mechanisms within the MyHuawei-App.\n  - **WEAKNESS:** Exposure of sensitive information due to the root cause.\n  - **IMPACT:** Compromised confidentiality.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the most appropriate CWE based on the vulnerability description, which highlights the **impact** of \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\". The primary candidate, CWE-200, directly aligns with this description. However, CWE-200 is discouraged because it is too general and represents an impact rather than the root cause.\n\nThe retriever results suggested several other CWEs, including CWE-497, CWE-213, and CWE-15. While CWE-15 relates to external control of system settings, it doesn't directly address the information exposure aspect. CWE-213 covers exposures due to incompatible policies, but the provided description doesn't indicate policy conflicts. CWE-497, focusing on exposure of sensitive *system* information, is a more specific child of CWE-200 and is therefore considered as a secondary mapping.\n\nThe final decision involves mapping CWE-200 as the primary weakness due to its direct relevance to the described **impact**, but recognizing its broad nature and including CWE-497 as a more specific, potential root cause if the exposed information is system-related.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 is supported by the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**, especially the \"**impact:** Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\" phrase. This highlights the direct connection between the vulnerability and the CWE description.\nThe evidence for CWE-497 is inferred due to the potential for system level information to be exposed.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available.
