While discouraged, its children, such as CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data), CWE-202 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries), and CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information), don't fully capture the vulnerability. CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) is a base-level CWE that is related but less directly descriptive. The relationship is visualized as follows:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe202[\"CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe202 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe209 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe202,cwe209,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is: **Improper input validation** of the 'from' parameter -> Insufficient permission checks within the rollback functionality -> Unauthorized access to private wiki pages (information leak).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability involves the MediaWiki software failing to properly validate input to the `action=rollback` query, particularly the `from` parameter. This **improper input validation** allows an attacker to **bypass permission checks**, leading to the **exposure of sensitive information** from private wiki pages.\n\nThe primary assigned CWE is CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor). Although it is discouraged by MITRE due to its high-level nature, in this case, there is not enough information to pinpoint a more specific root cause. The vulnerability's description and CVE details indicate a failure in authorization, but the exact mechanism of failure is not detailed enough to assign a more precise CWE. CWE-200 accurately describes the impact of the vulnerability - the exposure of sensitive information - even if it doesn't fully capture the root cause.\n\nCWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) was considered because the 'from' parameter could be viewed as a key that the user controls, which is then used to access data. However, this interpretation is a stretch, and the primary issue is with the **insufficient permission checks**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 is based on the evidence that an attacker can view private wiki contents by exploiting the `action=rollback` query with a specially crafted `from` parameter. This aligns with CWE-200's description: \"The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\"\n\nThe final decision is made with the understanding that more specific CWEs might be applicable if more detailed information about the root cause was available. However, based on the provided evidence, CWE-200 is the most appropriate choice. The usage is \"Discouraged\", but is chosen as a \"Class\" due to lack of better \"Base\" or \"Variant\" options.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
