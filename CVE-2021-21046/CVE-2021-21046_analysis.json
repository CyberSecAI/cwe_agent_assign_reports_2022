This parent-child relationship indicates that CWE-787 is a specific type of the more general CWE-119.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **buffer overflow** leading to an **out-of-bounds write**, which results in **memory corruption** and ultimately a denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **memory corruption** vulnerability in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" provided strong evidence for a **buffer overflow** as the root cause, which directly leads to an **out-of-bounds write**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 is based on the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" indicating a **buffer overflow**, which leads to the software writing data past the end of the intended buffer, thus aligning perfectly with the description of CWE-787. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-787 is a specific case of CWE-119, but given the available evidence, CWE-787 is the more precise and appropriate classification.\n\nThe confidence in this assessment is high (0.8) due to the clear description of the root cause as a **buffer overflow** and the resulting **out-of-bounds write**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\nThis CWE was not selected. There's no evidence of input validation issues related to equivalence.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\nThis CWE was not selected. The vulnerability is not directly related to reliance on untrusted inputs in security decisions.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\nThis CWE was not selected. There's no indication of a permissive list of allowed inputs causing the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-606: Unchecked Input for Loop Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\nThis CWE was not selected. The vulnerability is not related to unchecked input for loop conditions.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\nThis CWE was not selected. This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability is related to memory corruption, not reuse of sensitive information.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\nThis CWE was not selected. There's no indication of an incomplete list of disallowed inputs causing the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76, 7957.74\nThis CWE was not selected. While an out-of-bounds read could occur as a consequence, the root cause is the out-of-bounds write due to the buffer overflow.\n\n## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\nThis CWE was not selected. There's no indication of improper validation of consistency within input causing the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\nThis CWE was not selected. There's no indication of an unchecked return value causing the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\nThis CWE was not selected. While an incorrect buffer size calculation could lead to a buffer overflow, the provided information does not explicitly state this.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 7902.45, 4.33\nThis CWE was not selected. There's no evidence of integer overflow or wraparound in the description.\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 7893.34\nCWE-119 was considered as a possible classification because it generally describes the condition where operations are performed outside the intended boundaries of a memory buffer. However, given the specific details of the vulnerability involving a **buffer overflow** leading to an **out-of-bounds write**, CWE-787 is a more precise classification. CWE-119 is a parent of CWE-787. The mapping guidance for CWE-119 discourages its use when lower-level CWEs are available. This supports the decision to select CWE-787 instead.\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 7678.96\nThis CWE was not selected. There's no indication of improper validation of specified quantity in input causing the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 7589.62\nThis CWE was not selected. The vulnerability is not related to TOCTOU race conditions.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\nThis CWE was not selected. The vulnerability is not related to path equivalence issues.\n\n## CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\nThis CWE was not selected. The vulnerability doesn't explicitly involve untrusted pointer dereference.\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\nThis CWE was not selected. The vulnerability is not related to path traversal issues.\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\nThis CWE was not selected. The vulnerability is not related to resource allocation limits or throttling.\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\nThis CWE was not selected. The vulnerability is not related to external control of file names or paths.\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\nThis CWE was not selected. The vulnerability is not related to the insertion of sensitive information into sent data.\n\n## CWE-170: Improper Null Termination\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 3.89\nThis CWE was not selected. The vulnerability is not related to improper null termination.\n\n## CWE-781: Improper Address Validation in IOCTL with METHOD_NEITHER I/O Control Code\n**Abstraction Level**: variant\n**Similarity Score**: 3.88\nThis CWE was not selected. This CWE is specific to IOCTL and doesn't fit the general buffer overflow scenario.",
