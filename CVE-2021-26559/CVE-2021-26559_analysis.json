The application performs an authorization check, but the check is **incorrect**. |\n| CWE-200 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Configuration data contains **sensitive information** that is **inserted** and **sent** to a user with insufficient privileges. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization)**, a Class-level CWE. Although it is a class, there isn't sufficient information to pick a more specific child. **CWE-200 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data)** is a Base-level CWE and represents the disclosure of sensitive information. **CWE-200** can be related to **CWE-863**, showing that the improper authorization leads to sensitive data exposure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe200 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe202\n    cwe200 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe209\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control (CWE-863)**, which leads to the **insertion of sensitive information into sent data (CWE-200)**, resulting in privilege escalation.\n1.  **Root Cause:** **CWE-863** - **Incorrect Authorization** on the configurations endpoint. Users with \"Viewer\" or \"User\" roles are incorrectly authorized to access sensitive configuration data.\n2.  **Weakness:** **CWE-200** - **Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data.** The application sends sensitive configuration data to unauthorized users.\n3.  **Impact:** Privilege escalation, as the exposed configuration data can be used to gain higher-level access or control.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization)** as the primary weakness, which aligns with the vulnerability description stating \"**Improper Access Control on Configurations Endpoint**.\" The \"**improper**\" aspect is the key indicator for **Incorrect Authorization**. This is further supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which highlights the improper access control as the root cause.\n\nThe secondary weakness, **CWE-200 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data)**, captures the fact that **sensitive information** is being exposed due to the authorization bypass. This is supported by the vulnerability description stating that users can get Airflow Configurations including **sensitive information**.\n\nBased on the evidence provided and the CWE specifications, these CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. **CWE-863** correctly identifies the authorization failure, and **CWE-200** accurately describes the sensitive data exposure.",
