# Analysis for CVE-2021-21606

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 1 | Class | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-112 | Missing XML Validation | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)**, as the vulnerability description clearly states that the Jenkins application **improperly validates the format of a provided fingerprint ID**. This aligns with the core concept of CWE-20, where a program fails to adequately sanitize or verify input data. **CWE-112 (Missing XML Validation)** is a secondary consideration, as the vulnerability allows an attacker to check for the existence of XML files. While the vulnerability description doesn't explicitly mention the lack of XML validation, the ability to check for the existence of XML files suggests that XML validation is either missing or insufficient.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper validation of the fingerprint ID (CWE-20)**, which allows an attacker to check for the existence of arbitrary XML files.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, specifically the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" section, which states that the **root cause** is the "**improperly validates the format of a provided fingerprint ID**". This directly corresponds to **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)**. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section further reinforces this by mentioning that the Jenkins REST API "**does not properly validate the provided fingerprint ID**".

The graph relationships confirm that **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)** is a higher-level class, and **CWE-112 (Missing XML Validation)** could be a more specific instance of input validation. However, since the vulnerability description doesn't explicitly mention the lack of XML validation, **CWE-20** is a better fit as the primary CWE.

The selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, with **CWE-20** being a general class of weakness and **CWE-112** providing a more specific context related to XML files.

**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30018:** A messaging platform serializes all elements of User/Group objects, making private information available to adversaries
- **CVE-2022-29959:** Initialization file contains credentials that can be decoded using a "simple string transformation"
- **CVE-2022-35411:** Python-based RPC framework enables pickle functionality by default, allowing clients to unpickle untrusted data.




## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

### Extended Description
This weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.

### Alternative Terms
TOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to "Time Of Check To Time Of Use".
TOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.

**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed
- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.
- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.




## CWE-112: Missing XML Validation
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product accepts XML from an untrusted source but does not validate the XML against the proper schema.

### Extended Description
Most successful attacks begin with a violation of the programmer's assumptions. By accepting an XML document without validating it against a DTD or XML schema, the programmer leaves a door open for attackers to provide unexpected, unreasonable, or malicious input.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use






## CWE-609: Double-Checked Locking
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses double-checked locking to access a resource without the overhead of explicit synchronization, but the locking is insufficient.

### Extended Description
Double-checked locking refers to the situation where a programmer checks to see if a resource has been initialized, grabs a lock, checks again to see if the resource has been initialized, and then performs the initialization if it has not occurred yet. This should not be done, as it is not guaranteed to work in all languages and on all architectures. In summary, other threads may not be operating inside the synchronous block and are not guaranteed to see the operations execute in the same order as they would appear inside the synchronous block.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-667
CanPrecede -> CWE-367

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use






## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

### Extended Description


Developers may assume that inputs such as cookies, environment variables, and hidden form fields cannot be modified. However, an attacker could change these inputs using customized clients or other attacks. This change might not be detected. When security decisions such as authentication and authorization are made based on the values of these inputs, attackers can bypass the security of the software.


Without sufficient encryption, integrity checking, or other mechanism, any input that originates from an outsider cannot be trusted.


### Alternative Terms

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2009-1549:** Attacker can bypass authentication by setting a cookie to a specific value.
- **CVE-2009-1619:** Attacker can bypass authentication and gain admin privileges by setting an "admin" cookie to 1.
- **CVE-2009-0864:** Content management system allows admin privileges by setting a "login" cookie to "OK."




## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature
**Abstraction:** Base

- **CVE-2005-2182:** Insufficient verification allows spoofing.




## CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype.

### Extended Description


By adding or modifying attributes of an object prototype, it is possible to create attributes that exist on every object, or replace critical attributes with malicious ones. This can be problematic if the product depends on existence or non-existence of certain attributes, or uses pre-defined attributes of object prototype (such as hasOwnProperty, toString or valueOf).


This weakness is usually exploited by using a special attribute of objects called proto, constructor or prototype. Such attributes give access to the object prototype. This weakness is often found in code that assigns object attributes based on user input, or merges or clones objects recursively.
