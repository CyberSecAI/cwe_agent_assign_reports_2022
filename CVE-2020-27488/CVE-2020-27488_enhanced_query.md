# Enhanced Query for CVE-2020-27488

## Vulnerability Description
Loxone Miniserver devices with firmware before 11.1 (aka 11.1.9.3) are unable to use an authentication method that is based on the signature of the update package. Therefore, these devices (or attackers who are spoofing these devices) can continue to use an unauthenticated cloud service for an indeterminate time period (possibly forever). Once an individual devices firmware is updated, and authentication occurs once, the cloud service recategorizes the device so that authentication is subsequently always required, and spoofing cannot occur.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** use unauthenticated cloud service
- **vector:** spoofing
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** Loxone Miniserver devices
- **version:** before 11.1 (aka 11.1.9.3)

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which corresponds to CVE-2020-27488:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Loxone Cloud DNS service lacked proper authentication when a Loxone Miniserver reported its public IP address. Specifically, the service did not verify if the device sending the IP update was actually the legitimate Miniserver associated with the provided MAC address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The primary weakness was the absence of authentication for IP address updates sent to the Loxone Cloud DNS service. This allowed any device to register an arbitrary IP address for a given Miniserver MAC address.
*   **Unsecured UDP Datagram:** The Miniserver used an unauthenticated UDP datagram to announce its public IP address. The contents of the UDP datagram were not cryptographically signed, allowing an attacker to easily craft a fake message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** By registering a malicious IP address, an attacker could redirect traffic intended for the Loxone Miniserver's web interface to a fake login page and steal user credentials.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Even without a fake web interface, an attacker could cause a DoS by simply changing the registered IP address, preventing legitimate users from accessing the Loxone Miniserver remotely.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** With stolen credentials, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the Loxone Miniserver and, depending on the user's permissions, control the entire Loxone smart home system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Spoofed UDP Packets:** The attacker would need to craft and send UDP packets containing the target Miniserverâ€™s MAC address and the attacker's IP address to the Loxone Cloud DNS service.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** While not explicitly described, a MitM attack is also a possibility, allowing the attacker to intercept and modify communication between a Loxone Miniserver and the Cloud DNS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Target MAC Address:** The attacker needed to know the MAC address of the Loxone Miniserver they wished to target.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needed to be able to send UDP packets to the Loxone Cloud DNS servers. This could be from anywhere with an internet connection.
*   **Web Server Hosting (Optional):** To steal user credentials, the attacker needed to host a web server that imitated the Loxone Miniserver login page.
*   **Timing:** The attacker had to send the spoofed UDP packets within the one-minute window between legitimate updates from the Loxone Miniserver in order to maintain their fraudulent IP address.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Vulnerable Firmware Versions:** All Loxone Miniserver firmware versions prior to 11.1.9.3 were vulnerable since the introduction of Loxone Cloud DNS.
*   **Mitigation:** Loxone implemented several measures to address the vulnerability:
    *   Removed the "Last Update Timestamp" from HTTP responses to avoid leaking the update cycle of Miniservers.
    *   Implemented checks to detect rapid IP address changes, blacklisting potential attackers.
    *   Limited the number of updates from a single IP address per minute.
    *   Introduced a signature for update packages in Miniserver firmware version 11.1 and above to authenticate update packets.

The provided content offers a good level of detail regarding the vulnerability, its exploitation, and the steps taken by Loxone to mitigate it, and provides more detail than the official CVE description.

## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

## CWE-291: Reliance on IP Address for Authentication
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an IP address for authentication.

### Extended Description
IP addresses can be easily spoofed. Attackers can forge the source IP address of the packets they send, but response packets will return to the forged IP address. To see the response packets, the attacker has to sniff the traffic between the victim machine and the forged IP address. In order to accomplish the required sniffing, attackers typically attempt to locate themselves on the same subnet as the victim machine. Attackers may be able to circumvent this requirement by using source routing, but source routing is disabled across much of the Internet today. In summary, IP address verification can be a useful part of an authentication scheme, but it should not be the single factor required for authentication.

### Alternative Terms

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30319:** S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which can be bypassed by a forged IP address.




## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
According to WASC, "Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization."

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-672
ChildOf -> CWE-672

**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.






## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.

### Extended Description


A hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:

```
		Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.
		Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.
```
In the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.

The Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.
