CWE-290 is a parent of CWE-291 and both describe the **authentication bypass by spoofing** using the IP address. Since the product relied on the IP address for authentication, which could be spoofed, CWE-291 is also considered.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe290[\"CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\"]\n    cwe291[\"CWE-291: Reliance on IP Address for Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe290 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe291 -->|CHILDOF| cwe290\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe290,cwe291 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows: The Loxone Miniserver Cloud DNS service **lacked authentication (CWE-306)** for IP address updates. This **missing authentication** allowed attackers to **spoof** the Miniserver's IP address (**CWE-290**), potentially leading to credential theft, denial of service, or unauthorized access. The reliance on IP address for authentication is a **reliance on IP address for authentication (CWE-291)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **missing authentication** for a critical function, specifically updating the IP address in the cloud DNS service. This directly led to the ability to **spoof** the IP address and potentially compromise the system. The vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary provide sufficient evidence to support the selection of CWE-306 as the primary CWE.\n\nThe selection of CWE-306 is based on the following evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\": \"The primary weakness was the **absence of authentication** for IP address updates sent to the Loxone Cloud DNS service. This allowed any device to register an arbitrary IP address for a given Miniserver MAC address.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-290 and CWE-291 are based on the following evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\": \"The Miniserver used an unauthenticated UDP datagram to announce its public IP address. The contents of the UDP datagram were not cryptographically signed, allowing an attacker to easily craft a fake message.\"\n\nCWE-287, Improper Authentication, was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because it is a Class-level CWE, and CWE-306 provides a more specific description of the **missing authentication** issue.\n\nCWE-347, Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, was considered but not selected because the vulnerability was due to a **complete lack of authentication**, not an improper verification of a signature.\n\nCWE-345, Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity, was considered but not selected because it is a Class-level CWE. The root cause was **missing authentication**.\n\nCWE-295, Improper Certificate Validation, was considered but not selected, as there was no mention of certificates being used, rather the issue was regarding the **missing authentication** of the IP address update.\n\nCWE-613, Insufficient Session Expiration, was considered, but the description does not match the **missing authentication** root cause.\n\nCWE-259, Use of Hard-coded Password, was considered but not selected as there was no mention of hard-coded passwords.",
