CWE-862 and CWE-863 are more specific than CWE-285, which is discouraged. CWE-306 is related to authentication, and while authentication is a prerequisite for authorization, the **missing authorization** is the more direct cause of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check, leading to the ability to perform administrative actions without proper permissions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary, which indicates that the OpenIAM software **does not verify** if a user has permissions to perform administrative actions. This directly points to a **missing authorization** check.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is based on the evidence that the software **does not perform authorization** checks.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is considered a secondary candidate because while the description focuses on missing authorization, it's possible that some authorization checks are present but are not sufficient or correctly implemented.\n\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is also considered as a potential contributing factor, but the core issue is the lack of authorization for administrative actions, which is why it is a secondary consideration. The evidence states that the software **does not verify if a user has permissions** implying that authentication might be present, but authorization is missing.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity (Class for CWE-862, CWE-863 and Base for CWE-306).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n**Why Not Used**: Not related to missing authorization.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n**Why Not Used**: This is more about handling after the fact, not preventing the action.\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.\n**Why Not Used**: Not related to missing authorization.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n**Why Not Used**: Not applicable to the root cause of missing authorization.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n**Why Not Used**: Not applicable to the root cause of missing authorization.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n**Why Not Used**: Too high-level.\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n**Why Not Used**: This is more about the definition of the privilege, not the authorization check.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
