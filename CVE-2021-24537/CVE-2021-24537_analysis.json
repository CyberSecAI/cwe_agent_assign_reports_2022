CWE-94 is a more general case of code injection, while CWE-96 specifically deals with injecting code into statically saved code. The vulnerability involves injecting PHP code into a widget setting, which is then saved and executed. Therefore, CWE-96 is the more specific and accurate classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe96[\"CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe96 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe96 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper sanitization** of user-supplied input in the widget settings. This allows an attacker to inject PHP code into the \"Show only if page\" setting. When the widget settings are saved, the injected code is stored. When the page is accessed, the injected PHP code is executed by the server, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-96 as the most appropriate CWE, as it directly addresses the vulnerability of injecting code into statically saved code.\n\nThe evidence supporting this assessment is the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", which states that the vulnerability lies in the **lack of proper sanitization** or validation of user-supplied input in the widget settings, specifically within the \"Show only if page\" setting. This allows a user to inject PHP code which is then executed by the server.\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-96 is a child of CWE-94, which is a more general case of code injection. However, CWE-96 is more specific to the vulnerability, as it involves injecting code into statically saved code.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it accurately reflects the nature of the vulnerability and provides a clear understanding of the underlying weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of
