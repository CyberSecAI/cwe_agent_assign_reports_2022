The vulnerability might be caused by an **incorrect calculation of the buffer size** (CWE-131), which can precede a buffer overflow.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe131 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe122\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n    class cwe131 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a potentially **incorrect calculation of the buffer size** (CWE-131). This leads to a **heap-based buffer overflow** (CWE-122) when writing data beyond the allocated buffer. The root cause is writing past the buffer due to the incorrect size calculation which can be classified as CWE-122.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the most specific CWE for the described **heap-based buffer overflow**. The provided evidence is strong, explicitly stating the presence of a heap-based buffer overflow in the `op_Const64` function of Wasm3 version 0.5.0.\n\nThe retriever results also support this by listing CWE-122 as a potential candidate.\n\nThe relationship analysis further supports the selection of CWE-122, as it is a variant of the more general CWE-119. While CWE-119 is listed in the retriever results with a high score, the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. CWE-131 was considered as a potential root cause because **incorrect calculation of buffer size** could lead to the overflow, but it is less directly supported by the vulnerability description.\n\nThe final decision to map the vulnerability to CWE-122 is based on the clear evidence of a **heap-based buffer overflow**, the retriever results, and the relationship analysis, ensuring the selection of the most specific and accurate CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
