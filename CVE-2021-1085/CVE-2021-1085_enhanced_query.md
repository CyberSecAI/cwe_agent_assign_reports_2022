# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-1085

# Vulnerability Description

    NVIDIA vGPU driver contains a vulnerability in the Virtual GPU Manager (vGPU plugin), where there is the potential to **write to a shared memory location** and **manipulate the data after the data has been validated**, which may lead to denial of service and escalation of privileges and information disclosure but attacker doesnt have control over what information is obtained. This affects vGPU version 12.x (prior to 12.2), version 11.x (prior to 11.4) and version 8.x (prior to 8.7).

    ## WEAKNESS: 'write to a shared memory location'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-179: Incorrect Behavior Order: Early Validation (Score: 732.39)

The product validates input before applying protection mechanisms that modify the input, which could allow an attacker to bypass the validation via dangerous inputs that only arise after the modification....

### 2. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 610.25)

The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....

### 3. CWE-415: Double Free (Score: 533.80)

The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations....
