The retriever also returns CWE-863, which is a peer of CWE-287 and also a Class. The decision to choose CWE-287 as the primary CWE is based on the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning authentication bypass. CWE-287 can precede other vulnerabilities.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe613 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper running task check**, leading to an authentication bypass, which allows attackers to use locked applications without proper authentication.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **improper running task check** as the root cause, leading to authentication bypass. The retriever results suggested several CWEs related to authentication and authorization.\n\nThe primary decision driver was the presence of the term \"authentication bypass\" in the vulnerability description. CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) directly addresses scenarios where the system insufficiently proves the claimed identity.\n\nThe evidence is: \"Improper running task check in S Secure prior to SMR MAY-2021 Release 1 allows attackers to use locked app without authentication.\" and \"Weakness: The application does not properly verify the running process when a user attempts to access a locked application.\"\n\nCWE-287 is selected because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions authentication bypass. While the root cause is the improper check, the direct impact is the bypass of authentication.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): Considered as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability involves bypassing authentication to access locked applications. However, it is a less direct match than CWE-287.\n*   CWE-285 (Improper Authorization): Similar to CWE-863, it's related to access control but less specific to the authentication bypass.\n*   CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions): Too generic.\n*   CWE-927 (Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication): Not applicable, as the description doesn't mention intents.\n*   CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management): Not directly related to the authentication bypass.\n*   CWE-413 (Improper Resource Locking): Not applicable.\n*   CWE-613 (Insufficient Session Expiration): Not applicable.\n*   CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition): Doesn't appear to be a race condition.\n*   CWE-757 (Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')): Not applicable.",
