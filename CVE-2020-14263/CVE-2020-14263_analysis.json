CWE-1240 is a ChildOf CWE-327 and represents a more specific case of using a risky cryptographic algorithm. While a more specific CWE is preferred, the description provided does not give sufficient details to ensure CWE-1240 is a good fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n    \n    cwe1240 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe1240 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of root cause and weaknesses that followed for the Vulnerability Description:\n  - **Root Cause:** **Weak cryptographic process**\n  - **Weakness:** Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-327)\n  - **Impact:** Vulnerability in HCL Traveler Companion due to the MobileIron AppConnect SDK\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-327 as the primary CWE based on the vulnerability description, which mentions a **weak cryptographic process**. The retriever results also list CWE-327 as the top candidate. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-1240 is a child of CWE-327, representing a more specific case. However, without more details, mapping to CWE-1240 is less certain.\n\nThe final decision is to map the vulnerability to CWE-327 as the primary CWE due to its direct relevance to the **weak cryptographic process**.
