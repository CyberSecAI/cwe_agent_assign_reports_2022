CWE-20, a class-level weakness, is also considered as a contributing factor due to the **improper input validation** that enables the injection. The graph shows that CWE-96 is a child of CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')), indicating a hierarchical relationship where CWE-96 is a more specific type of code injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe96[\"CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe96 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe96 -->|REQUIRES| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe96 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20), which allows an attacker to inject code into a static resource, leading to **static code injection** (CWE-96). The injected code can then be executed, leading to remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered the **improper input validation** aspect, which pointed towards CWE-20. However, the core issue is the injection of code into a static resource, making CWE-96 a more accurate primary classification. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" provides strong evidence for this, stating that the root cause is the use of the PHP `eval()` function on unsanitized input, which directly relates to the injection of code.\nThe relationship graph indicates that CWE-96 is a child of CWE-94, further supporting the choice of a code injection-related CWE. The decision to use CWE-96 is based on its specific focus on static code injection, which aligns well with the vulnerability description. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-96 being a base-level weakness and CWE-20 providing context for the initial flaw.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
