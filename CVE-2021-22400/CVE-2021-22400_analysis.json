CWE-233 is a child of CWE-228, which indicates a hierarchical relationship. CWE-20 is a Class level CWE, and is discouraged. CWE-20 has child CWEs that are more specific such as CWE-1284 and CWE-1285.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe233[\"CWE-233: Improper Handling of Parameters\"]\n    cwe228[\"CWE-228: Improper Handling of Missing Values\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe1285[\"CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\"]\n\n    cwe233 -->|ChildOf| cwe228\n    cwe1284 -->|ChildOf| cwe20\n    cwe1285 -->|ChildOf| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe233 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n    class cwe1284,cwe1285 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of parameter validation** (CWE-233) leading to a system crash. The attacker needs to trick the user into installing a malicious app which modifies specific parameters to trigger the crash.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **insufficient input validation** and **lack of parameter validation**. The primary selection of CWE-233 is based on the vulnerability description indicating that the product does not properly handle when the expected number of parameters, fields, or arguments is not provided in input, or if those parameters are undefined, and that it is at the Base level of abstraction. The evidence comes from these key phrases:\n- **rootcause:** **insufficient input validation**\n- **weakness:** **lack of parameter validation**\n\nCWE-20 was considered but is discouraged, because there are more specific child CWEs.\n\nThe selection of CWE-233 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately reflects the **lack of parameter validation** and the **insufficient input validation** that leads to the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-99: Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the input before it is used as an identifier for a resource that may be outside the intended sphere of control.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
