# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2020-28625

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-129 | Improper Validation of Array Index | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE. The code reads integer values from the input file and uses them as indices into vectors without verifying if these indices are within the valid bounds of the vectors. |
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an **out-of-bounds read**. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-129, Improper Validation of Array Index, which is a variant of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). CWE-129 can lead to CWE-125, Out-of-bounds Read.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper validation of array index** (CWE-129), which leads to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125), and finally to potential code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified CWE-129 as the primary cause due to the **lack of input validation** of array indices, as stated in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The **out-of-bounds read** vulnerability is also mentioned in the vulnerability description, supporting the inclusion of CWE-125.

The relationship graph shows how **improper validation of array index** (CWE-129) can directly lead to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125). The evidence provided in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary section strongly supports the selection of CWE-129 as the primary weakness.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-129 directly addresses the root cause (**improper validation**), while CWE-125 describes the immediate consequence (**out-of-bounds read**).

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-606: Unchecked Input for Loop Condition
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
When converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-179: Incorrect Behavior Order: Early Validation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product validates input before applying protection mechanisms that modify the input, which could allow an attacker to bypass the validation via dangerous inputs that only arise after the modification.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-115: Misinterpretation of Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product misinterprets an input, whether from an attacker or another product, in a security-relevant fashion.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 7332.13
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 7159.87
**Source**: sparse
