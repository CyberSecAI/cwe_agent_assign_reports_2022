CWE-113 is more specific, focusing on the HTTP headers context, while CWE-93 is a more general **CRLF injection** issue. CWE-444 is related as it also deals with inconsistencies in HTTP request interpretation. The hierarchical relationship between CWE-113 and CWE-93 supports selecting the more specific CWE-113 when the vulnerability clearly involves HTTP headers.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe444[\"CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    cwe93 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe444 -->|CHILDOF| cwe436\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe113 primary\n    class cwe93,cwe444 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper sanitization** of user-controlled input, specifically carriage return and line feed characters. This leads to **HTTP response splitting or request splitting attacks**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to CWE-113 due to the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary explicitly mentioning **HTTP response splitting** and **improper sanitization** of user input when creating HTTP headers. The Retriever Results also rank CWE-113 as the top match.\n\nThe evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section states: \"The application fails to sanitize user-controlled input when creating header names, header values, status reason phrases, URI paths, or URI authority registered names,\" and mentions \"HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability\". This provides a solid basis for selecting CWE-113.\n\nThe selection of CWE-113 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **response-splitting or request-splitting attacks** within the context of HTTP headers, which is the core of the vulnerability.\nCWE-93 is a more general case of **CRLF Injection**, and while related, CWE-113 provides a more precise classification.\nCWE-444 is related, but focuses on inconsistent interpretation of HTTP requests, which is not the primary issue here, though could be a secondary concern.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
