Although it is a Class-level CWE, the evidence strongly supports the uncontrolled resource consumption due to multiple instances of the application being run. The description indicates a lack of proper resource management, leading to memory exhaustion. While more specific child CWEs of CWE-400 might be applicable with further information, the available evidence most directly supports CWE-400.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n\n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe664 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is as follows:\n1.  Multiple instances of vulnerable application are run.\n2.  The application fails to properly manage resources when multiple instances are running.\n3.  Uncontrolled memory consumption occurs.\n4.  Denial of service results from memory exhaustion.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **weakness** of the application failing to properly handle multiple instances, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service.\n\nThe **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** states:\n\"- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not properly handle multiple instances being run simultaneously, leading to memory exhaustion.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit can cause the system to run out of memory, leading to a denial-of-service condition.\"\n\nCWE-400 \"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\" closely matches this description.\nAlthough the MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-400, it is being selected as the primary CWE because it precisely captures the described vulnerability given the information available. The guidance to consider children/descendants such as CWE-770, CWE-771, CWE-410, CWE-772, CWE-834, and CWE-405 was reviewed; however, without further information, these are not as accurate as CWE-400. Therefore, I am overriding the discouraged mapping for CWE-400 due to the direct fit with the root cause as described.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
