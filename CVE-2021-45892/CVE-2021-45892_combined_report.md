## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain involves the following sequence:
  1. **Root Cause:** Use of a **weak, custom "password encryption" algorithm** for storing passwords.
  2. **Weakness:** **Storage of passwords in a recoverable format** (CWE-257).
  3. **Impact:** Disclosure of plaintext passwords, potential compromise of user accounts and database credentials, and further attacks.
There are no missing links in this chain, as the provided information clearly outlines the sequence of events.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **storage of passwords in a recoverable format**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states this, saying: "**Insecure Password Storage:** Instead of using industry-standard robust encryption or hashing techniques, the software relies on a custom algorithm that is easily reverse-engineered." and "**Recoverable Passwords:** The custom encryption algorithm is reversible, meaning that encrypted passwords can be decrypted to reveal their plaintext values."

The graph relationships influenced the final selection by providing context on related weaknesses. While CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage) and CWE-916 (Insufficient Hashing Effort) were considered, the vulnerability is more accurately described as storing passwords in a recoverable format because a weak encryption algorithm is being used. Thus, passwords are not technically in cleartext, and a hashing algorithm isn't necessarily being used. The selected CWE, CWE-257, is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **storage of passwords in a recoverable format** rather than a more general issue.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-45892

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in Softwarebuero Zauner ARC 4.2.0.4. There is storage of Passwords in a Recoverable Format.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **storage of passwords in recoverable format**
- **product:** Softwarebuero Zauner ARC
- **version:** 4.2.0.4

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45892:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a weak, custom "password encryption" algorithm within the ZA|ARC software. This algorithm is used for storing user passwords in the database and database credentials in the `zaarc.ini` configuration file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Password Storage:** Instead of using industry-standard robust encryption or hashing techniques, the software relies on a custom algorithm that is easily reverse-engineered.
*   **Recoverable Passwords:** The custom encryption algorithm is reversible, meaning that encrypted passwords can be decrypted to reveal their plaintext values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Disclosure of Plaintext Passwords:** An attacker who gains access to the database or the `zaarc.ini` file can easily recover plaintext passwords for both application users and database credentials.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:**  Compromised user accounts or database access credentials could allow an attacker to gain control over the ZA|ARC software, access sensitive archived data, and potentially pivot to other systems in the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Database Access:** An attacker could gain access to the database containing the encrypted passwords. This could be achieved through a SQL injection vulnerability, a compromised database account, or other methods of data exfiltration.
*   **Configuration File Access:** An attacker could gain access to the `zaarc.ini` file containing configuration data. This could occur if an attacker gains access to the server or file share hosting this file.
*   **Reverse Engineering:** The decryption algorithm can be reverse engineered from the ZA|ARC executable if the attacker has access to the software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the Database or Configuration Files:** An attacker needs access to the database where passwords are stored or the `zaarc.ini` configuration file where database credentials may be stored.
*   **Ability to Retrieve Encrypted Passwords:** The attacker must be able to obtain the encrypted password data, which may involve SQL queries or file access.
*   **Knowledge of the Custom Algorithm (Optional but useful):** While the custom algorithm can be reverse engineered, an attacker will be able to recover passwords more quickly with knowledge of the algorithm.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor has stated that they will not fix this vulnerability in the affected version (4.2.0.4). Users are advised to upgrade to `zaarc.next` when available.
*   A proof-of-concept Python script was created by SySS to demonstrate the vulnerability. However, it was not included in the advisory due to the absence of a public fix at the time of disclosure.
*   The advisory explicitly mentions the storage of passwords in the `BENUTZER` table under the columns `PASSWORT` and `TMPASSWORT`, further highlighting the nature of the vulnerability.

This analysis provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description, offering specific insights into the vulnerability's mechanics, impact, and exploitation methods.

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation
- **CVE-2022-30271:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used by default.
- **CVE-2020-10884:** WiFi router service has a hard-coded encryption key, allowing root access




## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

### Extended Description


Because the information is stored in cleartext (i.e., unencrypted), attackers could potentially read it. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.


When organizations adopt cloud services, it can be easier for attackers to access the data from anywhere on the Internet.


In some systems/environments such as cloud, the use of "double encryption" (at both the software and hardware layer) might be required, and the developer might be solely responsible for both layers, instead of shared responsibility with the administrator of the broader system/environment.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Different people use "cleartext" and "plaintext" to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.
- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie
- **CVE-2009-1466:** password stored in cleartext in a file with insecure permissions




## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

### Extended Description


Many password storage mechanisms compute a hash and store the hash, instead of storing the original password in plaintext. In this design, authentication involves accepting an incoming password, computing its hash, and comparing it to the stored hash.


Many hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. However, this efficiency is a problem for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker's workload for brute-force password cracking. If an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method (such as SQL injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by computing hashes efficiently. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing (such as cloud computing) and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware. In such a scenario, an efficient hash algorithm helps the attacker.


There are several properties of a hash scheme that are relevant to its strength against an offline, massively-parallel attack:


  - The amount of CPU time required to compute the hash ("stretching")

  - The amount of memory required to compute the hash ("memory-hard" operations)

  - Including a random value, along with the password, as input to the hash computation ("salting")

  - Given a hash, there is no known way of determining an input (e.g., a password) that produces this hash value, other than by guessing possible inputs ("one-way" hashing)

  - Relative to the number of all possible hashes that can be generated by the scheme, there is a low likelihood of producing the same hash for multiple different inputs ("collision resistance")

Note that the security requirements for the product may vary depending on the environment and the value of the passwords. Different schemes might not provide all of these properties, yet may still provide sufficient security for the environment. Conversely, a solution might be very strong in preserving one property, which still being very weak for an attack against another property, or it might not be able to significantly reduce the efficiency of a massively-parallel attack.

- **CVE-2008-4905:** Blogging software uses a hard-coded salt when calculating a password hash.




## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.

## CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly protect an assumed-immutable element from being modified by an attacker.

### Extended Description
This occurs when a particular input is critical enough to the functioning of the application that it should not be modifiable at all, but it is. Certain resources are often assumed to be immutable when they are not, such as hidden form fields in web applications, cookies, and reverse DNS lookups.

### Alternative Terms

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** MAID issues can be primary to many other weaknesses, and they are a major factor in languages that provide easy access to internal program constructs, such as PHP's register_globals and similar features. However, MAID issues can also be resultant from weaknesses that modify internal state; for example, a program might validate some data and store it in memory, but a buffer overflow could overwrite that validated data, leading to a change in program logic.

**[Theoretical]** There are many examples where the MUTABILITY property is a major factor in a vulnerability.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-1757:** Relies on $PHP_SELF variable for authentication.
- **CVE-2005-1905:** Gain privileges by modifying assumed-immutable code addresses that are accessed by a driver.

## CWE-1393: Use of Default Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses default passwords for potentially critical functionality.

### Extended Description
It is common practice for products to be designed to use default passwords for authentication. The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise. However, if admins do not change the defaults, then it makes it easier for attackers to quickly bypass authentication across multiple organizations. There are many lists of default passwords and default-password scanning tools that are easily available from the World Wide Web.

## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

### Extended Description
The lack of proper data encryption passes up the guarantees of confidentiality, integrity, and accountability that properly implemented encryption conveys.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-693

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider children CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information or CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** There is an overlapping relationship between insecure storage of sensitive information (CWE-922) and missing encryption of sensitive information (CWE-311). Encryption is often used to prevent an attacker from reading the sensitive data. However, encryption does not prevent the attacker from erasing or overwriting the data.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie
- **CVE-2009-1466:** password stored in cleartext in a file with insecure permissions
- **CVE-2009-0152:** chat program disables SSL in some circumstances even when the user says to use SSL.
