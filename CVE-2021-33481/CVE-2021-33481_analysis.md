| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.5 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-121, which is a Variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). Given the specific nature of the vulnerability being a stack-based buffer overflow, CWE-121 is the most appropriate and specific choice.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is straightforward: a **stack-based buffer overflow** (CWE-121) occurs due to **improper** bounds checking (likely implicit in the code) on data being written to a buffer allocated on the stack. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which clearly states a **stack-based buffer overflow** in the `try_to_divide_boxes()` function of `pgm2asc.c` in `gocr`. The CVE reference links confirm this as the root cause and potential impact.

The selection of CWE-121 is based on the explicit mention of a **stack-based buffer overflow**. While CWE-119 is a parent CWE, it's too general and is discouraged when a more specific CWE is available. The retriever results also list CWE-121 as a top result, further supporting this choice.

The evidence from the Vulnerability Description is: "A **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerability was discovered in gocr through 0.53-20200802 in try_to_divide_boxes() in pgm2asc.c."

The selection of CWE-121 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly describes the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-127: Buffer Under-read
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations prior to the targeted buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-786: Access of Memory Location Before Start of Buffer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available. It also overlaps existing CWE entries and might be deprecated in the future.

## CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation to determine how much memory to allocate, but an integer overflow can occur that causes less memory to be allocated than expected, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a named chain, which combines multiple weaknesses.

## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6481.77
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6151.19
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product
