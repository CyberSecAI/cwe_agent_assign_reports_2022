## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with an improper calculation or validation of input, leading to a buffer over-read.
1.  **Root Cause:** Improper input validation and/or calculation within `peg::resolve_escape_sequence` leads to an incorrect length calculation.
2.  **Weakness:** **Heap-based buffer over-read** (CWE-126). The code attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer.
3.  **Impact:** Crash or potential arbitrary code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary assessment is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference. The description explicitly mentions a **heap-based buffer over-read** in `pegresolve_escape_sequence()`, making CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read) the most appropriate primary CWE. The CVE reference further confirms that the `resolve_escape_sequence` function attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer due to an incorrect length calculation.

> Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
> - **weakness:** **heap-based buffer over-read**

The hierarchical relationships support the selection of CWE-126 as a more specific variant of CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read). The retriever results also list CWE-126 and CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) as top candidates.

CWE-126 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately represents the **heap-based buffer over-read** condition, aligning with the vulnerability's characteristics and impact.

CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) was considered, as the buffer is allocated on the heap. However, the description explicitly states an over-read, making CWE-126 a more precise fit than CWE-122 which implies a write.

CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) was also considered, but it is a more general case of reading beyond buffer boundaries. Since "over-read" is specifically mentioned and there is a more specific CWE for it, CWE-126 is preferred.

CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error) and CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) were also considered, but they represent potential causes of the over-read rather than the over-read itself.

CWE-170 (Improper Null Termination) was considered, but it describes a missing null terminator which is not the cause of the over-read.

CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) was considered because it could be related to the incorrect length calculation. However, the primary issue is the over-read, and CWE-126 directly addresses that.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2020-23915

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in cpp-peglib through v0.1.12. pegresolve_escape_sequence() in peglib.h has a **heap-based buffer over-read**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer over-read**
- **product:** cpp-peglib
- **version:** through v0.1.12
- **component:** pegresolve_escape_sequence() in peglib.h

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to CVE-2020-23915.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `peg::resolve_escape_sequence` function in `peglib.h`. The issue arises when processing escape sequences within the parser. Specifically, an invalid UTF-8 character can cause `codepoint_length` to return an incorrect length and cause a heap overflow in `resolve_escape_sequence`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The `resolve_escape_sequence` function attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer due to incorrect length calculation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The heap-buffer-overflow can lead to a crash or potentially allow for arbitrary code execution, though the provided information focuses on the crash aspect.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted input that contains invalid UTF-8 characters within escape sequences, which will be parsed by the peglib library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input that is parsed by the vulnerable function. This could be from a file, network socket or other input source.

The fix for this vulnerability is included in commit `b3b29ce8f3acf3a32733d930105a17d7b0ba347e`. The fix involves modifying the `codepoint_length` function in `peglib.h` to ensure the length calculation does not proceed when the buffer length is insufficient for UTF-8 character processing. Additionally, a test case was added in `test/test1.cc` to cover this scenario.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is not always a buffer overflow. For example, an off-by-one error could be a factor in a partial comparison, a read from the wrong memory location, an incorrect conditional, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-0252:** Off-by-one error allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via requests that do not contain newlines.
- **CVE-2001-1391:** Off-by-one vulnerability in driver allows users to modify kernel memory.
- **CVE-2002-0083:** Off-by-one error allows local users or remote malicious servers to gain privileges.




## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Overflow: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
Wraparound: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.

ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with "overflow," "underflow," and "wraparound" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called "underflows").


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.

**[Terminology]** 

"Integer overflow" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.


A "wraparound" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.


"Overflow" is sometimes conflated with "wraparound" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.


The "overflow" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use "overflow" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using "underflow" for exceeding the minimum.


Some people use "overflow" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses "underflow" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.


See [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.


**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.




## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.

### Extended Description


While the product might limit the amount of memory that is allocated in a single operation for a single object (such as a malloc of an array), if an attacker can cause multiple objects to be allocated in separate operations, then this might cause higher total memory consumption than the developer intended, leading to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms
Stack Exhaustion: When a weakness allocates excessive memory on the stack, it is often described as "stack exhaustion," which is a technical impact of the weakness. This technical impact is often encountered as a consequence of CWE-789 and/or CWE-1325.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-770
PeerOf -> CWE-789
CanPrecede -> CWE-476

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-36049:** JavaScript-based packet decoder uses concatenation of many small strings, causing out-of-memory (OOM) condition
- **CVE-2019-20176:** Product allocates a new buffer on the stack for each file in a directory, allowing stack exhaustion
- **CVE-2013-1591:** Chain: an integer overflow (CWE-190) in the image size calculation causes an infinite loop (CWE-835) which sequentially allocates buffers without limits (CWE-1325) until the stack is full.




## CWE-128: Wrap-around Error
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Wrap around errors occur whenever a value is incremented past the maximum value for its type and therefore "wraps around" to a very small, negative, or undefined value.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
CanPrecede -> CWE-119
PeerOf -> CWE-190

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** The relationship between overflow and wrap-around needs to be examined more closely, since several entries (including CWE-190) are closely related.






## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read




## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not initialize a critical resource.

### Extended Description
Many resources require initialization before they can be properly used. If a resource is not initialized, it could contain unpredictable or expired data, or it could be initialized to defaults that are invalid. This can have security implications when the resource is expected to have certain properties or values.
