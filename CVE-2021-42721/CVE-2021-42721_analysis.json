Although other CWEs were considered, none matched the provided evidence as directly as CWE-416. CWE-416 is a Variant of CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference) and CWE-672 (Operation on a Resource after Expiration).

This aligns directly with the description of **CWE-416** (Use After Free): \"The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating: \"* **Root cause of vulnerability**: Use-After-Free * **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a Use-After-Free (UAF) issue, which occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed. * **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the UAF vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution.\"\n\nThe retriever results also ranked **CWE-416** as the top candidate with a score of 1.0. The MITRE mapping guidance for **CWE-416** indicates that it is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is preferred, and the Usage is ALLOWED. Other CWEs, such as buffer overflows, were considered but deemed less relevant because the **root cause** is explicitly a **use-after-free** issue, not a buffer overflow.\nThe final decision is based primarily on the explicit evidence from the vulnerability description and supporting CVE details, coupled with the retriever results and MITRE mapping guidance. The selection of **CWE-416** is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:",
