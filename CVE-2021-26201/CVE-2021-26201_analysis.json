CWE-89 is a base level CWE which is the preferred level of abstraction for mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of input that allows for **SQL injection**, leading to **authentication bypass**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the Login Panel of CASAP Automated Enrollment System 1.0 is vulnerable to **SQL injection**, leading to an authentication bypass. The attacker can inject a SQL query in the username field of the login page to gain access to the admin panel. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms that the root cause is an **SQL injection** vulnerability in the `login.php` page and that by crafting a specific SQL query in the username field, the attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism.\n\nThe primary CWE match from the retriever results is CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')), which has a score of 1.0. This CWE accurately describes the vulnerability where the product constructs an SQL command using externally-influenced input but does not neutralize special elements, allowing attackers to modify the intended SQL command. The weakness is a base level which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')**\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-32530:** SQL injection in security product dashboard using crafted certificate fields\n- **CVE-2021-42258:** SQL injection in time and billing software, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-27101:** SQL injection in file-transfer system via a crafted Host header, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.",
