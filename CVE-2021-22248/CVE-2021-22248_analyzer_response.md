# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2021-22248

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.7 | Pillar | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, which is a child of the more general CWE-284, Improper Access Control. While CWE-284 broadly describes the issue, CWE-863 provides a more specific classification as the application performs an authorization check, but the check is performed incorrectly.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events for this vulnerability is as follows:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper authorization** check on the pipelines page.
2.  **Weakness:** Unauthorized users can bypass the authorization.
3.  **Impact:** Unauthorized users can view some pipeline information for public projects.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states "**Improper authorization**" as the root cause, making CWE-863 a strong candidate. The description also indicates that unauthorized users can "view some pipeline information," which is the impact of the **improper authorization**.

The Retriever Results listed several potential CWEs, including CWE-284, CWE-285, CWE-863, and CWE-639. Among these, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) aligns best with the description because it indicates that an authorization check is performed, but it's done incorrectly. This is more precise than CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), which is more general. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is even more general as a Pillar and is discouraged as a primary mapping according to MITRE.

CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) was also considered, but it is more specific to scenarios where a user-controlled key is used to bypass authorization, which isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided description. Therefore, CWE-863 is the most fitting choice.

The selection of CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately reflects the vulnerability's core issue: an existing authorization check that fails to properly restrict access. The MITRE guidance suggests that CWE-863 is a valid, although class-level, mapping and lower-level mappings are preferred. However, no variant or base CWEs fit the provided information well.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base

**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-540: Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Source code on a web server or repository often contains sensitive information and should generally not be accessible to users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
