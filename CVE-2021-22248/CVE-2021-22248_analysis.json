While CWE-284 broadly describes the issue, CWE-863 provides a more specific classification as the application performs an authorization check, but the check is performed incorrectly.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events for this vulnerability is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper authorization** check on the pipelines page.\n2.  **Weakness:** Unauthorized users can bypass the authorization.\n3.  **Impact:** Unauthorized users can view some pipeline information for public projects.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states \"**Improper authorization**\" as the root cause, making CWE-863 a strong candidate. The description also indicates that unauthorized users can \"view some pipeline information,\" which is the impact of the **improper authorization**.\n\nThe Retriever Results listed several potential CWEs, including CWE-284, CWE-285, CWE-863, and CWE-639. Among these, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) aligns best with the description because it indicates that an authorization check is performed, but it's done incorrectly. This is more precise than CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), which is more general. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is even more general as a Pillar and is discouraged as a primary mapping according to MITRE.\n\nCWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) was also considered, but it is more specific to scenarios where a user-controlled key is used to bypass authorization, which isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided description. Therefore, CWE-863 is the most fitting choice.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately reflects the vulnerability's core issue: an existing authorization check that fails to properly restrict access. The MITRE guidance suggests that CWE-863 is a valid, although class-level, mapping and lower-level mappings are preferred. However, no variant or base CWEs fit the provided information well.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
