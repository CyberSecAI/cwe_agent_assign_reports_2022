This parent-child relationship guided the selection, ensuring that the chosen CWE was specific to the authorization aspect of access control. CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] is a class-level CWE, and the description indicates a **missing access control**, so a more specific base CWE could exist. However, given the provided information, CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] is the most accurate and well-supported classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check in the `deleteCustomType` function. This leads directly to low-level authenticated users being able to delete custom extensions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The key phrase \"Missing Access Control in deleteCustomType function\" from the CVE summary directly supports the selection of CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization]. The description states that low-level authenticated users can delete custom extensions added by administrators, which clearly indicates a **lack of proper authorization**.\n\nThe retriever results listed several potential CWEs, including CWE-434 [CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type], CWE-863 [CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization], and CWE-352 [CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]. However, these were not selected because the vulnerability is primarily about **missing authorization**, not file type restrictions, incorrect authorization logic, or cross-site request forgery. The most relevant CWE, based on the provided evidence, is CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization].\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability which is the **missing authorization** check.",
