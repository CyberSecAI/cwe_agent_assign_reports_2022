CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a Class-level CWE, with potential Base-level children that could provide more specific classifications. However, given the limited information, CWE-862 is the most accurate and appropriate choice. CWE-200 is a peer that can occur if the missing authorization leads to information exposure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe200 -->|PEEROF| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which directly leads to local information disclosure. The chain is relatively straightforward, with the missing authorization being the root cause and the information disclosure being the immediate impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggested CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as the primary CWE due to the explicit mention of a **missing permission check** in the vulnerability description. The retriever results also ranked CWE-862 as the top candidate. The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section also lists CWE-862 as the \"Primary CWE Match.\"\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision includes:\n\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** \"**rootcause:** **missing permission check**\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"The vulnerability is in the system properties component.\"\n\nBased on the provided information and the retriever results, CWE-862 is the most appropriate primary CWE. The analysis considers the potential impact of information disclosure (CWE-200) as a secondary effect of the missing authorization. The final decision is based on the explicit evidence of a **missing permission check**, which aligns directly with the definition of CWE-862. The abstraction level of CWE-862 (Class) is appropriate, as there isn't sufficient evidence to map to a more specific Base-level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
