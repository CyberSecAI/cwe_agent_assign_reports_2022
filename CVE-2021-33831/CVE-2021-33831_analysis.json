This is related to CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), which is a parent. CWE-770 is the more specific of the two, making it a better fit. CWE-307 is a secondary CWE describing the lack of restriction on authentication attempts. This is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), but in this case, the specific weakness is the lack of rate limiting.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe307[\"CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe307 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe307 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect access control**, leading to a lack of rate limiting on user registration. This allows an attacker to create a large number of users, which then exhausts system resources and interferes with contact tracing.\n\n`Incorrect Access Control -> Lack of Rate Limiting -> Resource Exhaustion -> Interference with Contact Tracing`\n\nCWE-770 captures the resource exhaustion aspect, while CWE-307 captures the lack of rate limiting.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **incorrect access control** as the root cause, which is supported by the vulnerability description and CVE reference. The retriever results pointed to several relevant CWEs, including CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). After further analysis, CWE-770 was selected as the primary CWE because the core issue is that the application allows unlimited user registrations, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service. CWE-307 was selected as a secondary CWE to capture the missing rate limiting on authentication attempts.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary supports this assessment:\n\n*   \"An attacker can interfere with tracing of infection chains by creating 500 random users within 2500 seconds.\"\n*   \"The guest user registration endpoint (`/corona-app-backend/api/account/register`) lacks protection against automated user creation (e.g., no CAPTCHA).\"\n*   \"The application does not have any rate limiting or other measures to prevent the mass creation of users.\"\n*   \"Denial of Service (DoS): The creation of numerous fake users makes it difficult for health organizations to trace real infection chains...\"\n*   \"Resource Exhaustion: The generation and storage of numerous fake users can overwhelm system resources...\"\n\nCWE-770 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the allocation of resources without limits, which is the primary weakness exploited in this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
