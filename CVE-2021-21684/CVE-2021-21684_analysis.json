CWE-116 is a class-level CWE describing improper encoding or escaping of output. CWE-79 is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). CWE-116 can precede CWE-74.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe116 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe116 secondary\n    class cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to escape the Git SHA-1 checksum parameters provided to commit notifications**. This leads to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which means that malicious scripts can be injected and executed in the context of users viewing the build cause page.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-79, because the Jenkins Git Plugin **does not escape the Git SHA-1 checksum parameters provided to commit notifications** when displaying them in a build cause, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This aligns directly with CWE-79's description: \"The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\"\n\nThe \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section identifies the **rootcause** as \"**does not escape the Git SHA-1 checksum parameters provided to commit notifications**\" and the **impact** as \"stored cross-site scripting\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the plugin did not sanitize Git SHA-1 checksum parameters, which led to a stored XSS vulnerability.\n\nCWE-116 was considered as a possible secondary CWE because the **failure to escape** is a form of improper encoding or escaping of output. However, since the impact is specifically XSS, CWE-79 is the more accurate primary CWE.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)): This is not applicable as the vulnerability is about injecting malicious scripts, not forging requests.\n*   CWE-862 (Missing Authorization): This is not applicable as the vulnerability is about input sanitization, not authorization.\n*   CWE-549 (Missing Password Field Masking): This is not applicable as the vulnerability is about XSS, not password handling.\n*   CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')): This is not applicable as the vulnerability is about XSS, not OS command injection.\n*   CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type): This is not applicable as the vulnerability is about XSS, not file uploads.\n*   CWE-138 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements): This is a class-level CWE, and CWE-79 is a more specific base-level CWE.\n*   CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere): This is a high-level CWE, and CWE-79 is a more specific base-level CWE.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) because it directly addresses the **improper neutralization** of input leading to XSS.",
