The relationship between CWE-1390 (Authentication Bypass) and CWE-305 (Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness) were also considered to determine if the weakness was the primary cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe459[\"CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    cwe305[\"CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Authentication Bypass\"]\n\n    cwe459 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    cwe305 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe459 primary\n    class cwe305 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incomplete cleanup**, which, due to a race condition, leads to an authentication bypass.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitial analysis focused on the **rootcause**, **incomplete cleanup**, which is explicitly mentioned in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\". The impact is clearly stated as \"authentication bypass\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" points to a race condition being the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-459 (Incomplete Cleanup) as the primary CWE is based on the explicit mention of this weakness in the vulnerability description. The supporting evidence is from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\": \"***rootcause:*** **incomplete cleanup**\"\n\nCWE-305 (Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness) is considered as a secondary CWE because the **incomplete cleanup** directly leads to the authentication bypass. This is a direct consequence of the **incomplete cleanup**, making it a primary weakness leading to the bypass.\n\nThe retriever results also support the choice of CWE-459, as it is the top-ranked CWE.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was considered but not selected because the vulnerability is not related to input validation, but rather to **incomplete cleanup** after a process, leading to a race condition and subsequent authentication bypass.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **rootcause** (CWE-459) and the resulting impact (CWE-305).\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-179: Incorrect Behavior Order: Early Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product validates input before applying protection mechanisms that modify the input, which could allow an attacker to bypass the validation via dangerous inputs that only arise after the modification.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive -
