This CWE is a child of CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-288 is a more specific case of missing or improper authentication. CWE-288 and CWE-420 (Unprotected Alternate Channel) are peer of each other.\nThe abstraction levels influenced the decision to choose CWE-288 because it's a Base level, offering a more detailed description than its Class-level parent, CWE-287 (Improper Authentication).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe420[\"CWE-420: Unprotected Alternate Channel\"]\n\n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe306\n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe288 --|PEEROF| cwe420\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe288 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe284,cwe420 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper authentication implementation**, leading to the ability to **bypass login** and obtain a partially authorized token and UID.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the vulnerability description and CVE reference. The description clearly states that attackers can \"bypass login,\" which is a strong indicator of an authentication bypass. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this by stating \"Improper authentication implementation\" and \"The login mechanism can be bypassed to obtain a partially authorized token and UID.\"\n\nThe retriever results suggested several relevant CWEs, including CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel), and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function).\n\nCWE-288 was chosen as the primary CWE because it most accurately describes the vulnerability, where an alternate path is used to bypass the intended authentication mechanism. The evidence from the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"bypass login\", which aligns with CWE-288's definition.\n\nCWE-306 was considered as a strong candidate, but CWE-288 is a more specific case where an alternate path exists, rather than a complete absence of authentication.\n\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a class-level CWE and is discouraged when more specific CWEs are available. While it's related, CWE-288 provides a more accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nThe final selection is based on the available evidence and the principle of choosing the most specific CWE that accurately describes the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
