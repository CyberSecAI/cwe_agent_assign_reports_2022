CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, while CWE-285 is a Class. The relationship hierarchy guides us to the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability, where the authorization check is **missing**, not just incorrect or improperly handled.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing authorization** check in the `sspInit()` function of the `BlockchainTZService`. This **missing check** allows an attacker to start the `BlockchainTZService`, leading to unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis pointed to **improper access control**, but further examination of the vulnerability details and available CWEs led to a more specific classification. The key evidence is the statement that the vulnerability allows attackers to start `BlockchainTZService` due to **missing permission checks**. This suggests that there isn't an authorization check at all, which aligns perfectly with CWE-862 description: **Missing Authorization**.\n\nThe provided evidence: \"**Root cause:** **Improper access control** vulnerability in the `sspInit()` function within `BlockchainTZService`\" and \"The patch adds the proper permission check to prevent improper access to `BlockchainTZService`\", supports the decision to classify this as a **missing authorization** issue rather than simply an incorrect one.\n\nCWE-284 (**Improper Access Control**) and CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**) were considered due to the initial description of the vulnerability as an **improper access control** issue. However, the more specific description of **missing permission checks** makes CWE-862 a more accurate fit. CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, making it less specific than CWE-862, while CWE-285 is a Class, which could apply, but CWE-862 specifically identifies the **missing** aspect.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **absence of an authorization check**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because the issue isn't about handling insufficient privileges but about completely **missing** the authorization check.*\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.

However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because it is too high-level and doesn't accurately describe the root cause.*\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE was not selected because it is unrelated to resource shutdown or release.*\n\n## CWE-754:",
