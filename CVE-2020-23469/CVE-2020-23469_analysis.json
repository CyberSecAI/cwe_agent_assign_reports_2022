The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section also confirms that the **root cause** is the use of inefficient regular expressions which leads to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks.\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-1333 as the top candidate.\nThe description of CWE-1333 matches the vulnerability well: \"The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\"\nThe selection of CWE-1333 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the inefficient regular expression complexity, which is the **rootcause** of the denial-of-service vulnerability.
