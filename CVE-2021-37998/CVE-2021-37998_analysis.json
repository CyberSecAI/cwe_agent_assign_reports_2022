CWE-416 is a child of CWE-825 **Expired Pointer Dereference** and CWE-672 **Operation on Resource after Expiration**. It can be preceded by CWE-120 **Buffer Copy without Checking Size** and CWE-123 **Write-what-where Condition**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe120 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    cwe123 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe825,cwe672,cwe120,cwe123 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **Use After Free** (**CWE-416**) in the Garbage Collection component, leading to potential heap corruption. The attack vector is a crafted HTML page, exploited by a remote attacker.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, especially the key phrase \"**Use after free**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms that the root cause is \"**Use after free** in Garbage Collection\". The primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions is CWE-416, and it is also the top CWE.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-416 is a child of CWE-825 and CWE-672, which are related to expired pointers and operations on resources after expiration, respectively.\n\nCWE-416 is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is preferred. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-416 indicates that its Usage is Allowed and the rationale is that it's a preferred level of abstraction.\n\nThe other CWEs considered were:\n\n*   CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread - While race conditions can lead to use-after-free, the description doesn't explicitly mention a race condition.\n*   CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') - This CWE is not directly related to the **use-after-free** condition.\n*   CWE-911: Improper Update of Reference Count - While reference counting issues can cause premature freeing of memory, the description doesn't mention reference counting.\n*   CWE-415: Double Free - Similar to use-after-free, but the description specifically indicates \"**use after free**\" rather than a double free.\n*   CWE-590: Free of Memory not on the Heap - This is not related to **use-after-free**.\n*   CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition - This is a potential consequence of a **use-after-free** but is not the root cause.\n*   CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') - This is a class-level CWE, and the description doesn't explicitly mention a race condition.\n*   CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow - This is a type of buffer overflow, but the description points to a **use-after-free**.\n*   CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions - This is a high-level class and not specific enough.\n\nThe evidence supports the selection of CWE-416, as the vulnerability description explicitly states a **use-after-free** condition.",
