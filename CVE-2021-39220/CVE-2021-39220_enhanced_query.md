# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-39220

## Vulnerability Description
Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform The Nextcloud Mail application prior to versions 1.10.4 and 1.11.0 does by default not render images in emails to not leak the read state or user IP. The **privacy filter failed to filter images with a relative protocol**. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Mail application is upgraded to 1.10.4 or 1.11.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **privacy filter failed to filter images with a relative protocol**
- **impact:** leak the read state or user IP
- **vector:** rendering images in emails
- **product:** Nextcloud Mail application
- **version:** prior to versions 1.10.4 and 1.11.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Nextcloud Mail application's image blocking mechanism failed to filter images with a relative protocol (e.g., `//example.com/image.jpg`). This allowed embedded images to load even when they should have been blocked for privacy reasons.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation or sanitization of image URLs within emails.
- Failure to correctly handle URLs with relative protocols, leading to a bypass of the intended image blocking functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privacy Leakage:** When a user opens an email, the image loading can leak the read state of the email as well as the user's IP address to the server hosting the image. This bypasses the intended privacy protections of the email client.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker sends an email containing an image URL with a relative protocol (e.g., `//attacker.com/tracking.png`).
- When the victim views the email in the vulnerable Nextcloud Mail application, the image will be loaded, regardless of the image blocking being enabled, leaking information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send emails to a user of a vulnerable Nextcloud Mail application.
- The attacker must be able to host an image on a server under their control to track whether the victim has opened the email.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in version 1.10.4 of the Nextcloud Mail application.
- The issue is related to how the application handles URLs that do not specify a protocol (http/https), often referred to as "protocol-relative" URLs.
- The vulnerability is considered low severity, primarily due to the limited impact of information disclosure.

The provided content gives more details than the official CVE description which is a placeholder, specifically regarding the root cause (relative protocol handling), the attack vector (embedded image with relative protocol in email) and the impact (privacy leakage through IP and read status).

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

### Extended Description


Attackers might be able to spoof the intended endpoint from a different system or process, thus gaining the same level of access as the intended endpoint.


While this issue frequently involves authentication between network-based clients and servers, other types of communication channels and endpoints can have this weakness.

- **CVE-2022-4390:** A WAN interface on a router has firewall restrictions enabled for IPv4, but it does not for IPv6, which is enabled by default




## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description
This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.

### Alternative Terms
Zip Slip: "Zip slip" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
- **CVE-2019-20916:** Python package manager does not correctly restrict the filename specified in a Content-Disposition header, allowing arbitrary file read using path traversal sequences such as "../"




## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

### Extended Description


Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.


For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.


One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.


### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.

## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Stack Exhaustion: When a weakness allocates excessive memory on the stack, it is often described as "stack exhaustion," which is a technical impact of the weakness. This technical impact is often encountered as a consequence of CWE-789 and/or CWE-1325.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-770
CanPrecede -> CWE-476

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This weakness can be closely associated with integer overflows (CWE-190). Integer overflow attacks would concentrate on providing an extremely large number that triggers an overflow that causes less memory to be allocated than expected. By providing a large value that does not trigger an integer overflow, the attacker could still cause excessive amounts of memory to be allocated.

**[Applicable Platform]** 

Uncontrolled memory allocation is possible in many languages, such as dynamic array allocation in perl or initial size parameters in Collections in Java. However, languages like C and C++ where programmers have the power to more directly control memory management will be more susceptible.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2010-3701:** program uses ::alloca() for encoding messages, but large messages trigger segfault
- **CVE-2008-1708:** memory consumption and daemon exit by specifying a large value in a length field

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses




## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.

### Extended Description

- **CVE-2002-1783:** CRLF injection in API function arguments modify headers for outgoing requests.
- **CVE-2004-1513:** Spoofed entries in web server log file via carriage returns




## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.

### Extended Description


The sensitive information may be valuable information on its own (such as a password), or it may be useful for launching other, more serious attacks. The error message may be created in different ways:


  - self-generated: the source code explicitly constructs the error message and delivers it

  - externally-generated: the external environment, such as a language interpreter, handles the error and constructs its own message, whose contents are not under direct control by the programmer

An attacker may use the contents of error messages to help launch another, more focused attack. For example, an attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) might yield the full pathname of the installed application. In turn, this could be used to select the proper number of ".." sequences to navigate to the targeted file. An attack using SQL injection (CWE-89) might not initially succeed, but an error message could reveal the malformed query, which would expose query logic and possibly even passwords or other sensitive information used within the query.

- **CVE-2008-4638:** Composite: application running with high privileges (CWE-250) allows user to specify a restricted file to process, which generates a parsing error that leaks the contents of the file (CWE-209).




## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-3597:** Web application stores database file under the web root with insufficient access control (CWE-219), allowing direct request.




## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.

### Extended Description
When a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client. The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.
