This CWE addresses the **failure to validate inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are externally controllable.** The vulnerability lies in the **privacy filter failing to properly handle relative protocols**. This indicates that the filter logic assumed the protocol was fixed (http/https) but did not account for the relative protocol, which is externally controlled via the email content.\n\nCWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision, is a parent of CWE-472. The application makes a security decision (filtering images) based on an input (image URL) that can be manipulated by an attacker, so there is **reliance on untrusted input**.\n\nCWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data is related as the URL is being sent, and when accessed, reveals sensitive IP information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe472[\"CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\"]\n    cwe807[\"CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    \n    cwe472 -->|PEEROF| cwe807\n    cwe472 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe201\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe472 primary\n    class cwe807,cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper input handling** of image URLs with relative protocols. This leads to the bypass of the image blocking functionality, ultimately resulting in the leakage of the user's IP address and read state.\n\n`Improper Input Handling (CWE-472) -> Bypass of Privacy Filter -> Information Leakage (User IP/Read State)`\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **failure of the privacy filter** to properly handle images with a relative protocol. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly points to a problem with input validation and security decisions based on untrusted inputs.\n\nThe primary CWE selected, CWE-472, is based on the **root cause** identified in the provided text: \"**privacy filter failed to filter images with a relative protocol**.\" This directly aligns with the CWE's description of **insufficiently verifying inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable.** The relative protocol in the image URL is the externally controlled parameter that bypasses the intended filtering.\n\nAdditional CWEs were considered. CWE-807 was considered because the application makes a security decision (filtering images) based on an input (image URL) that can be manipulated by an attacker. CWE-201 was considered as the URL is being sent, and when accessed, reveals sensitive IP information.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a detailed and accurate representation of the vulnerability's underlying cause and its potential impact.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
