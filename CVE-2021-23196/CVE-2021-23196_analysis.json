CWE-602 is a Class-level CWE, and using CWE-603 is more specific and appropriate. CWE-1390 is also a class and less specific. The relationships show that the chosen CWE is appropriately granular and related to broader authentication issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe603[\"CWE-603: Use of Client-Side Authentication\"]\n    cwe602[\"CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe603 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe603 -->|CHILDOF| cwe602\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe603 primary\n    class cwe602,cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the **root cause**, the use of **authentication and session management mechanisms exclusively on the client-side**. This leads to **insufficiently protected credentials**. The impact is that an attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information, modify settings, or perform arbitrary actions as an authenticated user.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-603 as the primary candidate based on the vulnerability description, which states that the web application implements **authentication and session management mechanisms exclusively on the client-side**. This aligns directly with CWE-603's description: \"A client/server product performs authentication within client code but not in server code, allowing server-side authentication to be bypassed via a modified client that omits the authentication check.\" The **rootcause** is the **authentication and session management mechanisms exclusively on the client-side**\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-603 as the top combined result, supporting this choice. The mapping guidance for CWE-603 specifies that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level, and its usage is \"Allowed.\"\n\nCWE-602 and CWE-1390 were considered as secondary candidates because they are parent classes of CWE-603. However, since CWE-603 accurately describes the specific vulnerability, it is the most appropriate choice.\n\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces the selection of CWE-603: \"The web application on Agilia Link+ implements authentication and session management mechanisms exclusively on the client-side and does not protect authentication attributes sufficiently.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-603: Use of Client-Side Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA client/server product performs authentication within client code but not in server code, allowing server-side authentication to be bypassed via a modified client that omits the authentication check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is composed of a server that relies on the client to implement a mechanism that is intended to protect the server.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate",
