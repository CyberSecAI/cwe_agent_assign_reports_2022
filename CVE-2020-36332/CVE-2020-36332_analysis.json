CWE-789 is a variant of CWE-770, indicating a more specific type of resource allocation issue. Additionally, CWE-789 can be related to CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound), as integer overflows can lead to unexpected memory allocation sizes. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a higher-level class that encompasses both CWE-770 and other resource consumption issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe789 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n    class cwe400 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the processing of a malformed file, which leads to the **excessive memory allocation**, ultimately resulting in a denial-of-service.\n\n*   Root Cause: Processing of a malformed file with an excessively large size value.\n*   Weakness: **Improper memory allocation** without proper size validation.\n*   Impact: Denial of service due to memory exhaustion.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **excessive memory allocation** as the root cause, aligning with CWE-789. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-789 and CWE-770 as strong candidates. Further analysis of the vulnerability description and the provided CVE details confirmed that the vulnerability involves allocating memory based on an untrusted size, without proper validation, which directly matches the description of CWE-789. The evidence explicitly states \"When reading a file libwebp allocates an **excessive amount of memory**\". CWE-770 was considered because it describes allocating resources without limits, which is related. However, CWE-789 is more specific because it highlights the role of the excessive size value in the allocation process.\n\nCWE-400 was considered but deemed too high-level. While it's true that the vulnerability leads to uncontrolled resource consumption, the more specific weakness is the **improper memory allocation** based on an excessive size.\n\nTherefore, the selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-789 capturing the core weakness and CWE-770 providing additional context.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.
