CWE-200 is a Class level CWE while several other CWEs are Base level.

However, the MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-200 because it is often misused and represents a technical impact rather than a root cause.\n\nDespite this guidance, I am including it as the primary CWE because it is explicitly stated in the vulnerability description. It is possible that more specific CWEs could be applicable with more information. Additionally, I am including CWE-668 as a secondary CWE since CWE-200 is a child of CWE-668.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available.
