The retriever results did not return a more specific CWE, and the description aligns well with the general concept of incorrect authorization. CWE-863 is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863), leading to the **disclosure of information** to an unauthorized user. The chain is: **Incorrect Authorization** -> **Information Disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, which indicates an **incorrect authorization** mechanism that leads to information disclosure. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly states \"**Root cause of vulnerability: Incorrect Authorization**\" and \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** PI Vision could **disclose information** to a user with **insufficient privileges** for an AF attribute that is the child of another attribute and is configured as a Limits property.\"\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a Class-level CWE. According to the MITRE mapping guidance, it is \"Allowed-with-Review\" and suggests examining child entries for a better fit. While other CWEs like CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data), CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information), CWE-202 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries), and CWE-538 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory) relate to information exposure, they don't capture the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the authorization bypass. The description states a user with \"insufficient privileges\" can access information, aligning with the core concept of CWE-863. Thus, CWE-863 is the most appropriate despite being a Class.",
