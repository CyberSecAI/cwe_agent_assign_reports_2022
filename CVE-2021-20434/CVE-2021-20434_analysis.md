# Analysis for CVE-2021-20434

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 1 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-312, which is a child of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data). CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a Class-level CWE with potential Base-level children that might be more appropriate. CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) is a child of CWE-522 and could have been more specific, but the description only mentions storing credentials in "plain clear text". Therefore, CWE-312 is more fitting.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** of storing user credentials in plain clear text. The impact is that a local user can read these credentials. There's no intermediate step mentioned beyond that.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the vulnerability description that IBM Security Verify Bridge 1.0.5.0 **stores user credentials in plain clear text** which can be read by a local user.

The selection of CWE-312 is justified because it precisely describes the **weakness** of storing sensitive information in cleartext, making it accessible to unauthorized users (in this case, local users).

The graph relationships helped clarify that CWE-312 is a more specific and appropriate choice compared to its parent CWE-311.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-312 accurately captures the core issue, while more specific CWEs like CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) are too narrowly focused given the provided information.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
To fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme that is theoretically sound, but is not strong enough for the level of protection required.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
