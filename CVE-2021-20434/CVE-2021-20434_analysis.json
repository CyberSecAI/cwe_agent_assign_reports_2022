CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a Class-level CWE with potential Base-level children that might be more appropriate. CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) is a child of CWE-522 and could have been more specific, but the description only mentions storing credentials in \"plain clear text\". Therefore, CWE-312 is more fitting.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe312 -->|PEEROF| cwe522\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n    class cwe311,cwe256 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** of storing user credentials in plain clear text. The impact is that a local user can read these credentials. There's no intermediate step mentioned beyond that.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description that IBM Security Verify Bridge 1.0.5.0 **stores user credentials in plain clear text** which can be read by a local user.\n\nThe selection of CWE-312 is justified because it precisely describes the **weakness** of storing sensitive information in cleartext, making it accessible to unauthorized users (in this case, local users).\n\nThe graph relationships helped clarify that CWE-312 is a more specific and appropriate choice compared to its parent CWE-311.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-312 accurately captures the core issue, while more specific CWEs like CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) are too narrowly focused given the provided information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
