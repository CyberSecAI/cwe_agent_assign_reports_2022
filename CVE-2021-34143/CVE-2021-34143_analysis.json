CWE-799 (Improper Control of Interaction Frequency) is a related Class level CWE, indicating a potential cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe833[\"CWE-833: Deadlock\"]\n    cwe799[\"CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe662[\"CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\"]\n\n    cwe833 -->|CHILDOF| cwe667\n    cwe833 -->|CHILDOF| cwe662\n    cwe799 -->|CHILDOF| cwe691\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe833 primary\n    class cwe799 secondary\n    class cwe667,cwe662 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of continuous unsolicited LMP responses**, leading to a **deadlock**, which results in a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The description clearly states that the device **does not properly handle the reception of continuous unsolicited LMP responses**, leading to a **deadlock**. This aligns with the definition of CWE-833, which is \"The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports this by stating:\n\"The Bluetooth Classic implementation on several chipsets **does not properly handle the reception of continuous unsolicited LMP responses** that trigger a heap overflow within the BT firmware. This allows attackers in radio range to trigger a denial of service (either restart or **deadlock** the device) by flooding a device with LMP_AU_rand packet.\"\n\nCWE-799 (Improper Control of Interaction Frequency) is considered because the **improper handling** relates to the rate of incoming LMP responses. However, CWE-833 is chosen as the primary CWE because the vulnerability's direct impact is a deadlock. Both CWEs are relevant, but CWE-833 provides a more specific and accurate classification of the vulnerability. The relationships in the graph show that both CWE-833 and CWE-799 have parent child relationships with other CWEs which are also relevant.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
