CWE-285 is a child of CWE-284, representing a more specific type of access control issue related to authorization. However, no base level CWEs were a better fit. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information) is a class-level CWE that represents the impact of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe285 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe284,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control**, leading to unauthorized access to balance information.\n  - Root Cause: **Improper access control** (CWE-285)\n  - Impact: Unauthorized access to balance information (CWE-200)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **improper access control** as the root cause. This is explicitly stated in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section. The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to balance information by scanning a specific QR code.\n\nThe analysis considered the retriever results, which suggested CWE-200, CWE-926, CWE-284, and CWE-287, among others. However, CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was chosen as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **improper authorization** aspect of the vulnerability. CWE-284 is too high level, and while CWE-200 describes the impact, it doesn't describe the root cause.\n\nCWE-285 is a class-level CWE, and the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. However, in this case, none of the child CWEs of CWE-285 are a better fit based on the available information.\n\nThe selection of CWE-285 is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description, which clearly states **improper access control**. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-285 is a more specific type of access control issue than CWE-284. The final decision is to use CWE-285 because it more accurately reflects the root cause of the vulnerability than the other options, despite the discouraged usage.\n\nThe confidence level is 0.7 because while the evidence points to **improper access control**, the selection of CWE-285 is not ideal due to its class level and the discouraged usage. Further information might allow a more precise CWE to be assigned.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected:* This is not related to isolation or compartmentalization.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n*Not selected:* This CWE isn't about handling *insufficient* privileges but rather how privileges are assigned and checked in the first place.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected:* The issue isn't about releasing resources without clearing sensitive information.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
