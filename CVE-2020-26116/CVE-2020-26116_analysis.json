CWE-113, a variant of CWE-93, is more specific to HTTP headers, but CWE-93 is a better fit as a root cause. The relationship between CWE-93 and CWE-113 is hierarchical, with CWE-113 being a child of CWE-93.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    cwe93 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe93 primary\n    class cwe113 secondary\n    class cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper validation** or **neutralization of CRLF sequences** (CWE-93) within the HTTP request method. This leads to the ability to inject arbitrary headers, resulting in HTTP header injection and potentially information disclosure or other malicious activities.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-93 as the primary weakness, aligning with the vulnerability description and the provided CVE reference links. The vulnerability stems from the **failure to properly neutralize CRLF sequences** in the HTTP request method. The CVE summaries explicitly mention **CRLF injection** and HTTP header injection as vulnerabilities.\n\nThe selection of CWE-93 is based on its direct relevance to the **root cause** described in the vulnerability description and CVE details. The description clearly states that the `http.client` module in Python does not properly validate HTTP method names, allowing control characters to be injected. This directly corresponds to the **improper neutralization** aspect of CWE-93.\n\nCWE-113 was considered due to its specific focus on HTTP headers, but it is more of an impact rather than a root cause. The root cause is the **improper handling of CRLF sequences** in the input, which then leads to the header injection.\n\nThe relationship graph and the provided evidence support the selection of CWE-93 as the primary weakness. The abstraction level is appropriate, as CWE-93 is a Base level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
