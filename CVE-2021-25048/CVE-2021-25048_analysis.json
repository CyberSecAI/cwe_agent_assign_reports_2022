The vulnerability description also mentions a **lack of authorization and CSRF protection**, which are related to **CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]** and **CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]**, respectively.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe352 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIREDBY| cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe352,cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of authorization, CSRF protection, and sanitization/escaping**, leading to the **Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **lack of sanitization/escaping**, which leads to **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]**. The vulnerability description and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" clearly state that the plugin does not have proper sanitization/escaping, allowing for XSS payloads to be injected.  The summary states: \"The plugin does not have proper authorization, CSRF protection, and sanitization/escaping when creating profiles\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\". The retriever results also list **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]** as a potential match. Therefore, **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]** is the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nThe vulnerability description also mentions **lack of authorization and CSRF protection**. The retriever results list **CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]** and **CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]** as potential matches. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" supports the **lack of authorization and CSRF protection**, further strengthening the case for these CWEs. Therefore, **CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]** and **CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]** are considered as secondary candidates.\n\nCWE-116 [Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output] was considered but not used as CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is more specific to the XSS vulnerability.\nCWE-434 [Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type] was considered but is not applicable as the vulnerability is not related to file uploads.\nCWE-472 [External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter] was considered but does not directly apply as the vulnerability is primarily due to **lack of sanitization/escaping** and **lack of authorization and CSRF protection**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**",
