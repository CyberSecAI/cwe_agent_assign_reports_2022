## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-306, which is a base-level CWE indicating a **missing authentication** check. This aligns with the vulnerability description stating a "**missing control check**" that leads to an **authentication bypass**. CWE-306 is a child of the class-level CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). While CWE-287 broadly applies, CWE-306 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability, focusing on the absence of authentication rather than a flaw in the authentication process itself. Thus, CWE-306 is the appropriate choice.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing control check** (CWE-306), which leads to an **authentication bypass**. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to access the management interface with admin privileges.
- **Root Cause:** CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
- **Impact:** Authentication Bypass, Privilege Escalation

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis concludes that CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is the most appropriate primary CWE for this vulnerability. This decision is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions a "**missing control check**" when directly calling the autologin GET parameter. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also highlights the **missing access control** as a core issue.

The Retriever Results also list CWE-306 as a top candidate. While CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is also listed, it is a more general class-level CWE. The mapping guidance for CWE-287 discourages its use when lower-level CWE entries are applicable, suggesting CWE-306 as a possible alternative. Given the specific nature of the vulnerability—the complete absence of authentication for a critical function—CWE-306 is the more accurate choice.

The selection of CWE-306 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the **missing authentication** check. This is a base-level CWE, which is preferred for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

AVE DOMINAplus <=1.10.x suffers from an **authentication bypass** vulnerability due to **missing control check** when directly calling the autologin GET parameter in changeparams.php script. Setting the autologin value to 1 allows an unauthenticated attacker to permanently disable the authentication security control and access the management interface with admin privileges without providing credentials.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **missing control check**
- **weakness:** **authentication bypass**
- **impact:** disable authentication security control and access the management interface with admin privileges
- **vector:** setting the autologin value to 1
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attacker
- **product:** AVE DOMINAplus
- **version:** <=1.10.x
- **component:** changeparams.php script

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing access control check in the `changeparams.php` script. Specifically, the script doesn't properly validate user authentication when the `autologin` GET parameter is used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The core issue is the ability to bypass the authentication mechanism of the AVE DOMINAplus system.
- **Missing Access Control:** The `changeparams.php` script lacks the necessary checks to ensure that only authorized users can modify system settings using the `autologin` parameter.
- **Insecure Parameter Handling:** The system directly processes the `autologin` parameter without proper validation, allowing an attacker to influence the authentication state.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System Access:** An attacker can gain complete access to the management interface.
- **Admin Privileges:** By bypassing authentication, an attacker gains administrative privileges on the system.
- **Permanent Disablement of Authentication:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to permanently disable the authentication security control, allowing continued access without credentials.
- **Full Control:** With admin access, the attacker can modify configurations, manipulate connected devices, and perform other administrative tasks, potentially leading to significant disruption and security compromises within the home automation system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a specific HTTP GET request to the `changeparams.php` script with the `autologin` parameter set to 1.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the AVE DOMINAplus device. This could be local access on the same network as the device or remote access if the device is exposed to the internet.
- **No prior authentication required:** The attacker can execute the exploit without prior knowledge of valid credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of AVE DOMINAplus <= 1.10.x.
- The exploit is simple, requiring only a single GET request.
- The provided exploit code (`curl -s http://192.168.1.10/changeparams.php?operazione=3&autologin=1`) demonstrates how easily the vulnerability can be exploited.
- The vendor was unresponsive to multiple notifications.

- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

### Extended Description


If a web product does not properly protect assumed-immutable values from modification in hidden form fields, parameters, cookies, or URLs, this can lead to modification of critical data. Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.


For example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.


### Alternative Terms
Assumed-Immutable Parameter Tampering

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-642
ChildOf -> CWE-471

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is a primary weakness for many other weaknesses and functional consequences, including XSS, SQL injection, path disclosure, and file inclusion.

**[Theoretical]** This is a technology-specific MAID problem.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-0108:** Forum product allows spoofed messages of other users via hidden form fields for name and e-mail address.
- **CVE-2000-0253:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.
- **CVE-2000-0254:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.




## CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed as the result of a separate weakness that is primary to the authentication error.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1390

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Most "authentication bypass" errors are resultant, not primary.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-1374:** The provided password is only compared against the first character of the real password.
- **CVE-2000-0979:** The password is not properly checked, which allows remote attackers to bypass access controls by sending a 1-byte password that matches the first character of the real password.
- **CVE-2001-0088:** Chain: Forum software does not properly initialize an array, which inadvertently sets the password to a single character, allowing remote attackers to easily guess the password and gain administrative privileges.




## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
According to WASC, "Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization."

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-672
ChildOf -> CWE-672
CanPrecede -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.






## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

### Extended Description


Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.


For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.


One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.


### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-36539:** An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.




## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.
