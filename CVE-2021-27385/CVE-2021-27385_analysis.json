It is a child of CWE-834 (Improper Control of Recursion) and CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime).\nCWE-400 is a Class level CWE and parent of CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling). There is a potential chain from uncontrolled resource allocation leading to an infinite loop.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe835[\"CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n\n    cwe835 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    cwe835 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe835 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe770,cwe834,cwe664 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the receipt of specially crafted packets leading to **uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400)**, ultimately resulting in an **infinite loop (CWE-835)** and a denial-of-service condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that a remote attacker can send specially crafted packets to the SmartVNC device layout handler, which influences the amount of resources consumed and results in a denial-of-service condition due to an **infinite loop**.\n\nThe **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** highlights the impact as \"infinite loop\". The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** states \"The vulnerability is due to an **uncontrolled resource consumption** issue within the SmartVNC device layout handler on the client side... specially crafted packets can be sent by a remote attacker to influence the amount of resources consumed, which leads to an **infinite loop**.\"\n\nBased on this evidence, the primary CWE is CWE-835 \"Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\", with a confidence of 1.0. CWE-835 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nThe secondary CWE is CWE-400 \"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\" with a confidence of 0.8. CWE-400 is a Class level CWE and is mapped because the **uncontrolled resource consumption** leads to the infinite loop, it is a valid contributing factor.\n\nThe Retriever Results list CWE-835 and CWE-400 as potential CWEs.\n\nOther CWEs Considered and Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-755 (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions): While the infinite loop can be considered an exceptional condition, CWE-835 is a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer): Not directly related to the described vulnerability, which focuses on resource consumption leading to an infinite loop, not a memory buffer issue.\n*   CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling): Although related to resource consumption, the primary issue described is the resulting infinite loop. CWE-400 is already used, and it is a parent of CWE-770.\n*   CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value): Not explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation): While the crafted packets might not be properly validated, the core issue is the resource consumption and the resulting infinite loop.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1269: Product Released in Non-Release Configuration\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product released to market is released in pre-production or manufacturing configuration.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
