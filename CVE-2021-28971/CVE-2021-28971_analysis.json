CWE-476 is a child of CWE-754 (Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions). CWE-476 can follow CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value), CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')), CWE-252 (Unchecked Return Value), and CWE-1325 (Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe754[\"CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe252[\"CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\"]\n    cwe1325[\"CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\"]\n    \n    cwe476 -->|CHILDOF| cwe754\n    cwe789 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe476\n    cwe362 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe476\n    cwe252 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe476\n    cwe1325 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe476\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe476 primary\n    class cwe754,cwe789,cwe362,cwe252,cwe1325 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **mishandling of PEBS status in PEBS record**, which leads to a NULL pointer dereference, and ultimately a system crash.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference). The vulnerability description states that the root cause is a **mishandling of PEBS status in a PEBS record**, which leads to a NULL pointer dereference and then a system crash. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms the root cause and the NULL pointer dereference.\n\nCWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) is a base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The mapping guidance for CWE-476 is \"Allowed\".\n\nCWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) was considered because the **mishandling of PEBS status** could be interpreted as returning the wrong status code. However, the description of CVE-2021-28971 points to a null pointer dereference. So CWE-476 is a better fit.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that generates incorrect or unintended results that are later used in security-critical decisions or resource management.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.
