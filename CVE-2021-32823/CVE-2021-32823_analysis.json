It is related to CWE-405 (Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)) through a ChildOf relationship. The analysis also considered CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) and CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), with CWE-770 being a child of CWE-400. The relationship analysis helped to understand that the root cause involves inefficient computation leading to resource consumption, making CWE-1176 the most specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1176[\"CWE-1176: Inefficient CPU Computation\"]\n    cwe405[\"CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n\n    cwe1176 -->|CHILDOF| cwe405\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1176 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **inefficient creation of certain classes in BinData**, leading to excessive CPU consumption, and ultimately resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS).\n\nInitial Flaw: **very slow for certain classes in BinData to be created** (CWE-1176).\nResource Consumption: Excessive CPU consumption.\nImpact: Denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **weakness** of the \"very slow creation of certain classes in BinData\" which leads to a denial-of-service. The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this: \"The vulnerability stems from the **inefficient creation of certain classes** within the BinData RubyGem...Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive CPU consumption during class creation.\"\n\nThe \"Retriever Results\" pointed to CWE-1176 (Inefficient CPU Computation) as the top candidate, with a score of 0.746. The description of CWE-1176, \"The product performs CPU computations using algorithms that are not as efficient as they could be,\" aligns with the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was also considered but was deemed too general, as the issue is more specifically related to inefficient CPU usage. CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) was considered, but the primary issue isn't the allocation of resources without limits, but the inefficient computation.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1176 is based on the evidence that the **weakness** stems from the inefficient creation of classes, leading to excessive CPU consumption. This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-1176. The CWE is at the Class level of abstraction, which is appropriate given the available information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with
