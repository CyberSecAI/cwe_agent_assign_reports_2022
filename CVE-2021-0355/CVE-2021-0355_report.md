## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is an **integer overflow** (CWE-190). This can lead to an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787). CWE-190 is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation). CWE-787 is also a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). There's a CANPRECEDE relationship from CWE-190 to CWE-119, indicating the overflow can lead to buffer manipulation issues.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190), which then leads to an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787). The initial flaw is the integer overflow. This can occur due to **improper input validation** or an **incorrect calculation**, and it results in writing data outside the intended memory region.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified the **integer overflow** (CWE-190) as the primary root cause, leading to the **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787). The vulnerability description key phrases explicitly state "**rootcause:** **integer overflow**" and "**weakness:** **out of bounds write**". This direct evidence strongly supports the selection of these CWEs.

The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-190 can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which is a parent of CWE-787, further solidifying the connection between the overflow and the out-of-bounds write.

The selection of CWE-190 and CWE-787 is at the optimal level of specificity because they are both base-level CWEs that accurately represent the root cause and the resulting weakness, respectively. Other CWEs were considered but not selected because they didn't directly address the root cause and weakness described in the vulnerability. For example, CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) could be related, but the description specifically mentions an **integer overflow**, making CWE-190 a more precise fit.
