The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. |\n| CWE-200 | Information Exposure | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE. The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the CWE selection is the parent-child relationship. CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a class-level CWE, and while ideally a base-level CWE is preferred, it accurately captures the root cause. Similarly, CWE-200 is a class-level CWE that describes the impact of the missing authorization. The graph structure doesn't directly influence the primary choice but reinforces the idea of a weakness leading to a specific consequence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe200 -->|RELATEDTO| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which leads to the ability to read Bluetooth device names without proper permissions, resulting in local information disclosure (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-862 as the primary weakness due to the \"**missing permission check**\" described in the vulnerability description. This aligns with the definition of CWE-862: \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\" The impact, reading Bluetooth device names, directly results from this missing check.\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence: \"In Settings, there is a possible way to read Bluetooth device names without proper permissions due to a **missing permission check**.\"\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-862 as the top candidate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at an appropriate level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **missing authorization** issue.\n\nCWE-200 is included to capture the impact of the **missing authorization**, leading to information disclosure.\n\nOther CWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-927 (Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication): This is Android specific, but the vulnerability is more general than just the use of implicit intents.\n*   CWE-1289, CWE-807, CWE-183, CWE-1288, CWE-184, CWE-1173, CWE-451, CWE-179, CWE-138, CWE-606: These CWEs relate to input validation, but the core issue is the **missing permission check**, not the validation of input.\n*   CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition): This is not related to race conditions.\n*   CWE-41, CWE-73, CWE-22: These CWEs relate to path traversal, which is not relevant to this vulnerability.\n*   CWE-190, CWE-128, CWE-1339: These relate to arithmetic errors.\n*   CWE-205 (Observable Behavioral Discrepancy): This is too abstract.\n*   CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling): This is not relevant.\n*    CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation): This is too general and the problem is not with validation, but with missing authorization.\n*   CWE-514 (Covert Channel): Not related to covert channels.\n*   CWE-1021 (Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames): UI redress attacks do not apply.\n*   CWE-223 (Omission of Security-relevant Information): While this could be argued, the **missing permission check** is more direct.\n*   CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource): Not related to uninitialized resources.\n*   CWE-667 (Improper Locking): Not related to locking.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:",
