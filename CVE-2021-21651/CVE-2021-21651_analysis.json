However, since the vulnerability description clearly states a **missing** permission check, CWE-862 is a more accurate fit than CWE-285. Additionally, CWE-862 is a parent of more specific authorization issues, but none of them appear to be relevant for the current vulnerability. The \"Allowed-with-Review\" mapping guidance for CWE-862 suggests examining its children, but the provided information does not indicate any child CWEs that are a better fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe359 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing** authorization check on an HTTP endpoint. This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to bypass access controls and obtain a list of configured profiles.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-862 as the primary weakness due to the **missing** permission check. The evidence to support the primary CWE is: \"The S3 publisher Plugin **does not perform a permission check** in an HTTP endpoint.\"\nThe retriever results listed CWE-862 as the top candidate. The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to a list of configured profiles. CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered because the configured profiles might contain sensitive information. However, without knowing the exact contents of the profiles, it is difficult to confirm that it is private personal information. Therefore, a low confidence secondary mapping was considered.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
