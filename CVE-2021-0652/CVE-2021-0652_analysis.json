While **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** represents the potential impact, the root cause lies in the **sharing of not thread-safe objects**. The relationship between **CWE-366** and **CWE-667 (Improper Locking)** is also relevant, as improper locking can lead to race conditions.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe366[\"CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization\"]\n\n    cwe366 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe787\n    cwe366 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe667 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe366\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe366 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe667,cwe362 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **sharing of not thread-safe objects** (likely leading to **CWE-366**), potentially resulting in **memory corruption** (**CWE-787**). The lack of proper synchronization or locking mechanisms might contribute to the race condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed towards **CWE-366 (Race Condition within a Thread)** as the primary weakness due to the **sharing of not thread-safe objects**. This is supported by the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms the **thread safety issue** as the root cause.\n\nThe retriever results showed **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** as the top hit, but this is more of an impact than the root cause. **CWE-366 (Race Condition within a Thread)** and **CWE-667 (Improper Locking)** were also considered and determined to be relevant as contributing factors.\n\nThe final decision prioritizes **CWE-366 (Race Condition within a Thread)** because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: **sharing of not thread-safe objects**. While **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** is a potential impact, mapping to the root cause provides a more accurate and actionable classification. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE summary strongly support this decision.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
