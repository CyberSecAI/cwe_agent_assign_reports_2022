While it's generally preferred to map to Base-level CWEs, the evidence strongly supports that the authorization check is performed, but it's **incorrect**. CWE-863 is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization). CWE-425 (Direct Request) is a related CWE at the Base level, representing a scenario where authorization checks are not adequately enforced on all restricted URLs. CWE-425 is a child of CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect** authorization check (CWE-863). A user with Contributor role can access other posts metadata. This is due to the plugin's failure to properly validate permissions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the retriever results suggested CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as a possible match, and the vulnerability description supports this. The plugin performs an authorization check, but it is **incorrect**, allowing contributors to access admin posts' metadata. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states, \"The plugin lacks proper authorization checks, allowing users with contributor roles and above to access arbitrary post metadata.\" However, it is not a case of \"Missing Authorization\" (CWE-862) because some form of authentication exists. Rather, the existing authorization logic **incorrectly** grants access to resources.\n\nCWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) was also considered as a secondary issue. The vulnerability description indicates that contributors can directly request the metadata of posts they shouldn't have access to. This is supported by the description of how a contributor can use the `custom_field` shortcode to retrieve metadata from a specified post. Therefore, it is appropriate as a secondary CWE.\n\nThe evidence provided clearly indicates an authorization flaw where permissions are not validated correctly. The selection of CWE-863 and CWE-425 are at the optimal level of specificity, reflecting both the incorrect permission checks and the ability to directly access restricted resources.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
