CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a general class, and several more specific CWEs are children of it. However, based on the provided information, a more precise child CWE isn't immediately evident. The relationships also show potential chains, with CWE-200 potentially following other weaknesses related to resource handling or authentication, but these are not explicitly detailed in the vulnerability description. The abstraction levels guided the decision to stay at the Class level for the primary CWE due to a lack of specific details.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe213[\"CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies\"]\n    \n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe668 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe213 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe668,cwe213 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain, as inferred from the description, starts with **improper security token protection**, leading to **exposure of sensitive information**, and ultimately allowing an attacker to access the system with elevated privileges. The chain is:\n\n1.  **Improper Security Token Protection** (Implicit - Not a specific CWE, but the root cause)\n2.  CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (Information Exposure)\n3.  Elevated Privileges (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) as the primary weakness, supported by the description highlighting \"exposure of sensitive information\" due to **improper security token protection**. The retriever results also list CWE-200 as the top candidate. However, CWE-200 is discouraged due to its broad nature. Despite this discouragement, without more specific information, it remains the most fitting primary CWE.\n\nThe choice of CWE-200 is based on the vulnerability description and key phrases, specifically the mention of \"exposure of sensitive information\" and \"**improper security token protection**\" as the root cause.\n\nThe relationships influenced the decision by considering the child CWEs of CWE-200. However, none of the child CWEs provided a significantly better fit based on the available information.\n\nCWE-200 is selected as the primary CWE because it aligns with the reported \"**exposure of sensitive information**\" due to \"**improper security token protection**\". This is supported by the retriever results ranking CWE-200 as the top candidate. Although CWE-200 is discouraged for its generality, the lack of specific details in the vulnerability description prevents the selection of a more precise CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
