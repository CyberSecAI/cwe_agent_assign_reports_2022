This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-926 is a more specific instance of the broader authorization issue described by CWE-285.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe926[\"CWE-926: Improper Export of Android Application Components\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe926 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe926 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper export** of an Android application component, specifically a content provider. This **allows** an attacker to access a **non-existent provider**, potentially leading to denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the analysis focused on the \"access non-existent provider\" key phrase. However, after reviewing the CVE Reference Links Content Summary and the Retriever Results, it became clear that the root cause is the **improper export** of the component, which then **allows** the attacker to attempt accessing the non-existent provider.\n\nThe evidence supporting this is from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states: \"The Samsung Health application prior to version 6.19.1.0001 contains a vulnerability that **allows access to a non-existent content provider**.\" Furthermore, the vulnerability description itself mentions that the attacker can \"access it via malicious content provider\".\n\nCWE-926, Improper Export of Android Application Components, is at the Variant level and is ALLOWED per MITRE's mapping guidance. The description of CWE-926 aligns well: \"The Android application exports a component for use by other applications, but **does not properly restrict which applications can launch the component or access the data it contains.**\" The vulnerability allows an attacker to access the content provider via a malicious content provider.\n\nCWE-285, Improper Authorization, was considered but not chosen as the primary CWE. While related, it's a more general Class-level CWE, and CWE-926 provides a more specific description of the Android component export issue. The MITRE guidance DISCOURAGES using CWE-285 when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-926: Improper Export of Android Application Components\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.064\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe Android application exports a component for use by other applications, but does not properly restrict which applications can launch the component or access the data it contains.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.057\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nWhen an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.056\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants of this entry instead.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.052\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with \"privilege escalation,\" which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.\n**Comments:** If an error or mistake allows privilege escalation, then use the CWE ID for that mistake. Avoid using CWE-269 when only phrases such as \"privilege escalation\" or \"gain privileges\" are available, as these indicate technical impact of the vulnerability - not the root cause weakness. If the root cause seems to be directly related to privileges, then examine the children of CWE-269 for additional hints, such as Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250) or Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.050\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n## CWE-927: Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.497\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe Android application uses an implicit intent for transmitting sensitive data to other applications.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
