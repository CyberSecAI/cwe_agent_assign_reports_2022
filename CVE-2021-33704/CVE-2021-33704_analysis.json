It is a child of CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**) and CWE-284 (**Improper Access Control**). Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions **missing authorization**, CWE-862 is the most appropriate choice. Although it is a Class-level CWE, the provided information does not allow for a more specific Base-level CWE to be selected.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the following steps:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862): The application lacks the necessary checks to ensure that users are authorized to perform specific actions.\n2.  **Impact:** Abuse of functionality usually restricted to specific users. The attacker can invoke restricted functions and potentially read, modify, or delete sensitive data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness identified is CWE-862, **Missing Authorization**, based on the vulnerability description and key phrases that explicitly mention **missing authorization**. The description states that an authenticated attacker can invoke functions restricted to specific users, leading to potential data breaches. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-862.\n\nThe Retriever Results also support this choice, with CWE-862 being ranked highly. While CWE-284 (**Improper Access Control**) is the top result, it is a Pillar-level CWE and is discouraged due to its high level of abstraction. CWE-862 is a more specific Class-level CWE, making it a better fit.\n\nCWE-306 (**Missing Authentication for Critical Function**) was considered but is less appropriate because the attacker is already authenticated; the issue is the lack of authorization checks after authentication.\n\nThe final decision is based on the explicit mention of **missing authorization** in the vulnerability description, the support from Retriever Results, and the relationship analysis that identifies CWE-862 as the most specific and relevant CWE.\nRelevant CWE Information:",
