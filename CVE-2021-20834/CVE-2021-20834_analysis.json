CWE-862 is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) which is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). The hierarchical relationship indicates a progression from a general access control issue down to a specific flaw in handling custom URL schemes. Alternatives such as CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) were considered, but the evidence points more strongly to a missing authorization check in the custom URL scheme handler rather than an incorrectly implemented one.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe939[\"CWE-939: Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe939 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe939 primary\n    class cwe862,cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper authorization** in the custom URL scheme handler. This **weakness** allows a remote attacker to redirect the user to an arbitrary website.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **improper authorization** in the custom URL scheme handler as the root cause. The CVE description states: \"**Improper authorization** in handler for custom URL scheme vulnerability in Nike App for Android versions prior to 2.177 and Nike App for iOS versions prior to 2.177.1 allows a remote attacker to lead a user to access an arbitrary website via the vulnerable App.\"\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"The Nike App improperly restricts the use of custom URL schemes. This means the app doesn't validate or sanitize URLs provided to it, allowing it to potentially load any arbitrary website.\"\n\nGiven this evidence, CWE-939 (Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme) is the most appropriate mapping. It is a Base level CWE, providing sufficient specificity. The retriever results also list it as the second highest match.\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) were considered because the description refers to **improper authorization**. However, the context indicates the authorization mechanism is either entirely missing or insufficient, making CWE-939 the more precise choice. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) were considered but they are too high-level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
