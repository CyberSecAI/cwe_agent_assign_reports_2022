This is preferred because the vulnerability description explicitly states the credentials are stored in plain clear text.\n\nCWE-312 is a child of CWE-311 (**Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data**) and CWE-922 (**Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information**). While CWE-311 broadly covers the absence of encryption, CWE-312 pinpoints the specific issue of storing sensitive data without encryption.\n\nCWE-522 (**Insufficiently Protected Credentials**) is a Class level CWE and a parent of CWE-256 (**Plaintext Storage of a Password**). While relevant, these are less specific than CWE-312.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe922[\"CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe922\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe311,cwe922,cwe522,cwe256 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-312 (**Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information**) - The software stores user credentials in plain clear text.\n2.  **Impact:** An authenticated admin user can read the credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access or privilege escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the explicit statement in the vulnerability description: \"IBM Jazz for Service Management and IBM Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus_GUI 8.1.0 **stores user credentials in plain clear text** which can be read by an authenticated admin user.\"\n\nThis directly corresponds to the definition of CWE-312 (**Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information**), which states, \"The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\"\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-312 is a more specific and appropriate choice than its parent, CWE-311 (**Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data**). While encryption is missing, the core issue is the storage of data in an unencrypted format.\n\nCWE-522 (**Insufficiently Protected Credentials**) is a more general Class that can apply to various credential protection failures, but CWE-312 more precisely describes the vulnerability. CWE-256 (**Plaintext Storage of a Password**) is very similar, but the description is oriented just for Passwords and does not include the broader credentials weakness described in the vulnerability description.\n\nTherefore, CWE-312 is the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product **stores sensitive information in cleartext** within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why this CWE was selected:** This CWE directly matches the vulnerability description indicating credentials are stored in cleartext. The 'Usage: Allowed' mapping guidance supports this choice.\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Why this CWE was considered:** This CWE is relevant as it broadly covers the insecure storage of credentials. However, CWE-312 provides a more specific classification since the credentials are in 'cleartext'.\n\n## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.321\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nStoring a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why this CWE was considered:** Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why this CWE was NOT selected:** The vulnerability description mentions storage, not transmission.\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why this CWE was NOT selected:** This vulnerability is focused on storage, and there is no mention of error messages.",
