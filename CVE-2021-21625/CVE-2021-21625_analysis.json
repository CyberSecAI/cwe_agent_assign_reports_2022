While CWE-285 is a parent, it is discouraged. CWE-862 is also related to CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). The analysis focused on finding the most specific Class-level CWE related to authorization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check**, leading to the ability to enumerate credentials IDs.\n\nMissing Authorization -> Enumerate Credentials IDs\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **missing permission check**, which is a clear indicator of an authorization issue. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly states this. The Retriever results strongly suggest CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as the primary candidate.\n\nThe evidence is strong: \"**rootcause:** **missing permission check**\" and \"The AWS Credentials Plugin did not perform a permission check in a helper method for HTTP endpoints.\"\n\nCWE-862 is at the Class level, and the MITRE mapping guidance suggests reviewing its children for a better fit. However, none of the children are more appropriate given the available information.\n\nCWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) was considered as a secondary candidate because the enumeration of credentials IDs could be seen as exposing a resource (the credentials) to the wrong sphere. However, the root cause is more directly related to the **missing authorization**, making CWE-862 a stronger fit. CWE-668 is also discouraged.\n\nThe final decision is based on the explicit evidence of a **missing permission check**, the high retriever score for CWE-862, and the MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-862.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.",
