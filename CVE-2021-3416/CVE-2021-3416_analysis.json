This can then lead to a **stack overflow** (CWE-121), ultimately resulting in a denial-of-service.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"A potential **stack overflow** via **infinite loop** issue was found in various NIC emulators of QEMU... The issue occurs in loopback mode of a NIC wherein reentrant DMA checks get bypassed. A guest user/process may use this flaw to consume CPU cycles or crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.\"\n\nThe evidence from \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the root cause is the bypassed reentrancy check leading to a potential **infinite loop** and subsequent **stack overflow**.\n\nCWE-835 is chosen as the primary CWE because the **infinite loop** is the direct result of the **missing** reentrancy checks. While the **stack overflow** is a consequence of the **infinite loop**, the **infinite loop** is the more immediate and direct result of the flaw.\n\nCWE-121 is selected as a secondary CWE because the **infinite loop** leads to a **stack overflow**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-835 is a Base-level CWE and directly describes the **infinite loop** condition. CWE-121 is a Variant-level CWE and describes the **stack-based buffer overflow** that can result from the **infinite loop**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n-   **CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')**: This is a Base level CWE and perfectly describes the **infinite loop** condition in the vulnerability.\n-   **CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow**: This is a Variant level CWE and describes the **stack overflow** condition that can result from the **infinite loop**.\n-   **CWE-834: Excessive Iteration**: This is a Class level CWE and is a parent of CWE-835. It is less specific than CWE-835 and therefore not as appropriate.\n-   **CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion**: While recursion can cause stack exhaustion, the issue here is specifically related to a loop, not recursion.\n-   **CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value**: This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not directly related to memory allocation size.",
