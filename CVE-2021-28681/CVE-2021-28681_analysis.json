CWE-295 is a base level CWE, which means it's at a good level of abstraction for the root cause. CWE-295 has a PeerOf relationship with CWE-322 (Key Exchange without Entity Authentication).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe295[\"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\"]\n    cwe772[\"CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    \n    cwe772 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe295 primary\n    class cwe772 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper certificate validation** (CWE-295). Because the connection isn't torn down properly, there is a **missing release of resource** (CWE-772) after the lifetime of the connection.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates that the Pion WebRTC library **did not properly tear down the DTLS Connection when certificate verification failed**. The key phrase \"improper DTLS Connection teardown\" and the CVE Reference Links summary stating that \"The library **did not properly terminate the connection** upon DTLS fingerprint verification failure\" both point to a failure in managing the connection's lifecycle after a verification failure.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation, because that's where the teardown should have happened, and that is the root cause.\nThe secondary CWE is CWE-772 Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime, because the connection was not terminated.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 4632.59\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
