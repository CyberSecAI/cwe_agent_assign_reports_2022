CWE-113 is `ChildOf` CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences (CRLF Injection)), CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), and CWE-436 (Interpretation Conflict). CWE-113 `CanPrecede` CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')). CWE-120 is a base-level CWE, and it `ParentOf` CWE-785 (Improperly Specified \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 bound). CWE-120 `CanFollow` CWE-456 (Missing Initialization), CWE-416 (Use After Free), CWE-231 (Unprotected Storage of Credentials), and CWE-170 (Improper Null Termination).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences (CRLF Injection)\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe436[\"CWE-436: Interpretation Conflict\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\"]\n    \n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe436\n    cwe113 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe113 primary\n    class cwe93,cwe20,cwe436,cwe79,cwe120 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers** (CWE-113). This leads to **HTTP response splitting**, which can then be exploited to facilitate cross-site scripting (XSS), cookie manipulation, and information exfiltration. In addition, the **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers** could also lead to buffer overflows (CWE-120).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates an **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers**, leading to HTTP response splitting. The description also mentions that this can lead to buffer overflows, segment faults, or other impacts.\nThe primary CWE is CWE-113 because the vulnerability description states the **rootcause** is an **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers** which leads to **HTTP response splitting**.\nThe secondary CWE is CWE-120 because the vulnerability description states that it can lead to buffer overflows, segment faults, or other impacts, which is consistent with a buffer overflow.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
