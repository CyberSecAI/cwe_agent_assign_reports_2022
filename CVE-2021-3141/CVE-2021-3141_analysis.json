The **Keycloak password is stored in recoverable format**. |\n| CWE-798 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. While not explicitly stated as \"hard-coded\", the **password stored in recoverable format** could imply the use of default credentials. |\n| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability mentions that the **Keycloak password is stored in a recoverable format** which could mean cleartext storage. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-257, which has a parent-child relationship with CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials). CWE-257 is also a peer of CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) and CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key), all of which are related to credential management issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe257[\"CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe257 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe257 -->|PEEROF| cwe259\n    cwe257 -->|PEEROF| cwe321\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe257 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe259,cwe321,cwe798,cwe312 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause** which is the **Keycloak password stored in a recoverable format** (CWE-257). This allows a local attacker to gain access to the Management Server, ultimately leading to the ability to change the Stealth configuration.\n  - CWE-257 (Root Cause): Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\n  - Impact: Gain access to Management Server and change Stealth configuration.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment based on the vulnerability description and key phrases is that the primary weakness is related to storing the Keycloak password in a **recoverable format**. The Retriever Results and Complete CWE Specifications support this assessment, with CWE-257 being the top result.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"In Unisys Stealth (core) before 6.0.025.0, the **Keycloak password is stored in a recoverable format** that might be accessible by a local attacker, who could gain access to the Management Server and change the Stealth configuration.\"\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-257 is related to other credential management issues like using **hard-coded passwords** (CWE-259, CWE-798) or cryptographic keys (CWE-321). This influenced the decision to also consider CWE-798 as a secondary candidate, though the primary issue remains the **recoverable format**.\n\nCWE-257 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level for mapping root causes. It accurately represents the specific weakness of storing passwords in a way that allows them to be recovered, leading to potential unauthorized access.\n\nCWE-312 was also considered, as \"recoverable format\" could imply that the password is in cleartext.\n\nI am confident in assigning CWE-257 as the primary CWE, with CWE-798 and CWE-312 as secondary considerations. The final selection is based on the provided evidence, relationship analysis, and adherence to mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users.
