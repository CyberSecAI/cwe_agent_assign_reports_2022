This is a child of the more general CWE-119, which describes improper restrictions of operations within memory buffers. The relationship shows the specificity of CWE-120 better captures the vulnerability details.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size Limits ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe120 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **buffer overflow** due to **missing** size limit checks during the copy operation, leading to potential compromise of the Oracle Solaris system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis, based on the CVE description and reference links, strongly indicates a **buffer overflow** vulnerability in the Solaris PAM module. The reference links content summary explicitly mentions \"A **buffer overflow** vulnerability exists in Solaris' PAM username handling.\" This, coupled with the fact that an \"excessively long username\" triggers the issue, leads to the conclusion that the most appropriate CWE is CWE-120.\n\nCWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size Limits ('Classic Buffer Overflow')) is selected because the vulnerability involves copying data into a buffer without proper size validation. This directly aligns with the description and root cause provided. The evidence is strong, giving a high confidence score of 0.9.\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) was considered as a more general case, as CWE-120 is a child of CWE-119. However, CWE-120 is more specific and accurately reflects the nature of the **buffer overflow** due to the **missing** size check during the copy operation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
