CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, while the retriever results provide a number of Base and Variant level CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe200 -->|ChildOf| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** in the Adobe Acrobat Reader DC add-on that allows for arbitrary file system reads. This leads to the **impact** of information disclosure, where an unauthenticated attacker can check for the existence of local files.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description indicates that an unauthenticated attacker can check for the existence of local files due to a **weakness** that allows arbitrary file system reads, leading to information disclosure.\n\nThe \"**Root Cause:** Information Exposure\" and \"**Weakness:** Arbitrary file system read\" found in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section provides direct evidence for selecting CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor].\n\nThe Retriever Results identify CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] as the top candidate. Although the Usage for CWE-200 is \"Discouraged\", the description of CWE-200 aligns with the vulnerability's impact: \"The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\" The content summary states \"An attacker can read arbitrary files from the file system,\" which supports this mapping.\n\nCWE-787 [Out-of-bounds Write] and CWE-788 [Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer] were considered but rejected as they relate to memory corruption issues, which are not directly indicated in the vulnerability description. The focus here is on reading arbitrary files, not memory access violations.\n\nCWE-427 [Uncontrolled Search Path Element] was also considered, but it is more relevant to vulnerabilities involving the use of untrusted search paths, which is not the case here.\n\nBased on the available evidence, CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] is the most appropriate CWE because the **weakness** allows the attacker to read arbitrary files from the file system. While CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and its usage is Discouraged, the vulnerability description doesn't provide enough information to pinpoint a more specific Base-level CWE.",
