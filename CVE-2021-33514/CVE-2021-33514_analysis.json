CWE-78 is a specific type of CWE-77, focusing on OS commands. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"OS command in User-Agent field\" and command injection, making CWE-78 a more precise match.\nCWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs) is included as a secondary weakness because the root cause also includes the **lack of proper sanitization**, which could be caused by an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe184\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe184 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with **insufficient input sanitization** which leads to **command injection**, ultimately resulting in **arbitrary code execution**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **command injection** as the primary weakness. The subsequent analysis confirmed that CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command) is the most appropriate CWE due to the explicit mention of \"OS command\" in the vulnerability description. The root cause evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the **lack of sanitization** of the token parameter, leading to the ability to inject shell commands. The summary stated \"The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject shell commands by breaking out of the single quotes used within the `sprintf` command\".\nCWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs) was added as a secondary weakness given the **lack of proper sanitization** which may be caused by an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause and the nature of the vulnerability. CWE-78 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred, and it accurately represents the **improper neutralization of special elements in an OS command**.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 7762.21\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not",
