CWE-90 is a child of CWE-943 (Improper Neutralization Across Input Boundaries) and CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')), but CWE-90 provides the most specific description of the vulnerability. The relationships between CWE-90 and other CWEs, such as the CANFOLLOW relationship to authentication and verification errors, is consistent with the provided vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe90[\"CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization Across Input Boundaries\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe90 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n    cwe90 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe90 primary\n    class cwe943,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events for this vulnerability is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Lack of sanitization** of user-supplied input in the `POST /login` endpoint.\n2.  **Weakness:** **Improper Neutralization** of special elements used in an LDAP query.\n3.  **Impact:** **LDAP injection**, leading to potential authentication bypass and information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed to CWE-90, and a deeper review of the evidence confirmed this assessment. The vulnerability description explicitly states that an unauthenticated user can send a request with a specially-crafted username to inject unsanitized content into the LDAP filter. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is a **lack of sanitization** of user-supplied input when constructing LDAP filters, leading to **LDAP Injection**.\n\nThe retriever results also support this conclusion, with CWE-90 being the top-ranked CWE.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the vulnerability: **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')**. While higher-level CWEs like CWE-74 or CWE-943 could apply, CWE-90 provides the most accurate and specific classification. The MITRE mapping guidance supports the selection of a Base level CWE when appropriate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an LDAP query using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended LDAP query when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-943\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Can be primary to authentication and verification errors.\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-41232:** Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)\n- **CVE-2005-2301:** Server does not properly escape LDAP queries, which allows remote attackers to cause a DoS and possibly conduct an LDAP injection attack.",
