The vulnerability involves storing JWT tokens in cleartext on the file system. CWE-459 (Incomplete Cleanup) is a potential secondary CWE, suggesting the application fails to remove sensitive data after use, but the primary issue is the cleartext storage itself.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe313[\"CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe459[\"CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup\"]\n\n    cwe313 -->|ChildOf| cwe312\n    cwe459 -->|ChildOf| cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Shutdown or Release of Resource\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe313 primary\n    class cwe459 secondary\n    class cwe312,cwe404 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient cache clearing mechanisms**, leading to the **cleartext storage** of JWT tokens, which allows an attacker with local file access to obtain and decode these tokens, ultimately leading to account compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is clearly **cleartext storage** (CWE-313) of JWT tokens. The vulnerability description explicitly states that JWT tokens are stored in cleartext on the file system due to **insufficient cache clearing mechanisms**. This allows attackers with local access to read user files and obtain the JWT tokens.\n\nThe selection of CWE-313 is based on the following evidence:\n\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** \"**weakness:** **cleartext storage**\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"The TimelyBills application for both iOS (<= 1.7.0) and Android (<= 1.21.115) stores JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication tokens in a local file within the app directory without sufficient cache clearing mechanisms. These tokens are used for authentication and authorization.\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"**Cleartext Storage:** The JWT tokens are stored in cleartext on the file system, making them easily accessible to anyone with access to the device's file system.\"\n\nCWE-459 (Incomplete Cleanup) is a potential secondary CWE because the **insufficient cache clearing mechanisms** contribute to the tokens remaining accessible.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-313 is a Variant that directly addresses the storage of sensitive information in cleartext on a file or disk. While other CWEs like CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) and CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) were considered, CWE-313 is a more precise fit given the context of file storage.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
