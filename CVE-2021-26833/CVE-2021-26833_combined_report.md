## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient cache clearing mechanisms**, leading to the **cleartext storage** of JWT tokens, which allows an attacker with local file access to obtain and decode these tokens, ultimately leading to account compromise.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is clearly **cleartext storage** (CWE-313) of JWT tokens. The vulnerability description explicitly states that JWT tokens are stored in cleartext on the file system due to **insufficient cache clearing mechanisms**. This allows attackers with local access to read user files and obtain the JWT tokens.

The selection of CWE-313 is based on the following evidence:

*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** "**weakness:** **cleartext storage**"
*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** "The TimelyBills application for both iOS (<= 1.7.0) and Android (<= 1.21.115) stores JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication tokens in a local file within the app directory without sufficient cache clearing mechanisms. These tokens are used for authentication and authorization."
*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** "**Cleartext Storage:** The JWT tokens are stored in cleartext on the file system, making them easily accessible to anyone with access to the device's file system."

CWE-459 (Incomplete Cleanup) is a potential secondary CWE because the **insufficient cache clearing mechanisms** contribute to the tokens remaining accessible.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-313 is a Variant that directly addresses the storage of sensitive information in cleartext on a file or disk. While other CWEs like CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) and CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) were considered, CWE-313 is a more precise fit given the context of file storage.

## Vulnerability Description
Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk in TimelyBills <= 1.7.0 for iOS and versions <= 1.21.115 for Android allows attacker who can locally read users files obtain JWT tokens for users account due to **insufficient cache clearing mechanisms**. A threat actor can obtain sensitive user data by decoding the tokens as JWT is signed and encoded, not encrypted.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient cache clearing mechanisms**
- **weakness:** **cleartext storage**
- **impact:** obtain JWT tokens for users account
- **vector:** locally read users files
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** TimelyBills
- **version:** <= 1.7.0 for iOS, <= 1.21.115 for Android

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-26833:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The TimelyBills application for both iOS (<= 1.7.0) and Android (<= 1.21.115) stores JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication tokens in a local file within the app directory without sufficient cache clearing mechanisms. These tokens are used for authentication and authorization.
*   The tokens do not expire and remain in the local directory even after the user logs out of the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Storage:** The JWT tokens are stored in cleartext on the file system, making them easily accessible to anyone with access to the device's file system.
*   **Insufficient Cache Clearing:** The application fails to properly clear or invalidate the stored JWT tokens upon logout, leaving them vulnerable even after a user is no longer actively using the application.
*   **Lack of Encryption:** The tokens are not encrypted, only signed and encoded, which means the information within the token can be easily decoded and read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who gains local access to the device's file system can read the stored JWT tokens.
*   **Account Hijacking:**  By using the stolen JWT tokens, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the victim's TimelyBills account and perform actions as the victim without requiring the user's credentials again.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The attacker can decode the JWT token and potentially reveal sensitive user information contained within it.
*   **Malicious App Abuse:** If a malicious application is installed on the same device, it could potentially access the TimelyBills app’s directory and steal the JWT tokens.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File System Access:** The primary attack vector is through local access to the device's file system, either by physical access or through malware.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs local access to the device's file system. This could be achieved through:
    *   Direct physical access to the device.
    *   Compromising the device through malware.
    *   Gaining access through a rooted or jailbroken device.
*   The attacker needs the ability to read files within the TimelyBills application's directory.

**Additional Information:**

*   The article also highlights other security flaws in the TimelyBills application, including an account takeover vulnerability through password reset manipulation and the ability to upload malicious files to the server, but these issues are unrelated to CVE-2021-26833.
*   The vendor was notified of these issues but did not respond or apply fixes in a timely manner, leading to public disclosure after the CVE was assigned.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly "clean up" and remove temporary or supporting resources after they have been used.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Insufficient Cleanup

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-404
ChildOf -> CWE-404

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** CWE-459 is a child of CWE-404 because, while CWE-404 covers any type of improper shutdown or release of a resource, CWE-459 deals specifically with a multi-step shutdown process in which a crucial step for "proper" cleanup is omitted or impossible. That is, CWE-459 deals specifically with a cleanup or shutdown process that does not successfully remove all potentially sensitive data.

**[Relationship]** Overlaps other categories such as permissions and containment. Concept needs further development. This could be primary (e.g. leading to infoleak) or resultant (e.g. resulting from unhandled error conditions or early termination).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2000-0552:** World-readable temporary file not deleted after use.
- **CVE-2005-2293:** Temporary file not deleted after use, leaking database usernames and passwords.
- **CVE-2002-0788:** Interaction error creates a temporary file that can not be deleted due to strong permissions.




## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."

### Relationships

## CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext in a file, or on disk.

### Extended Description
The sensitive information could be read by attackers with access to the file, or with physical or administrator access to the raw disk. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-312

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Different people use "cleartext" and "plaintext" to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-1481:** Cleartext credentials in world-readable file.
- **CVE-2005-1828:** Password in cleartext in config file.
- **CVE-2005-2209:** Password in cleartext in config file.




## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Resources that may contain sensitive data include documents, packets, messages, databases, etc. While this data may be useful to an individual user or small set of users who share the resource, it may need to be removed before the resource can be shared outside of the trusted group. The process of removal is sometimes called cleansing or scrubbing.


For example, a product for editing documents might not remove sensitive data such as reviewer comments or the local pathname where the document is stored. Or, a proxy might not remove an internal IP address from headers before making an outgoing request to an Internet site.

**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is intended to be different from resultant information leaks, including those that occur from improper buffer initialization and reuse, improper encryption, interaction errors, and multiple interpretation errors. This entry could be regarded as a privacy leak, depending on the type of information that is leaked.

**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).

**[Terminology]** The terms "cleansing" and "scrubbing" have multiple uses within computing. In information security, these are used for the removal of sensitive data, but they are also used for the modification of incoming/outgoing data so that it conforms to specifications.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release
- **CVE-2005-0406:** Some image editors modify a JPEG image, but the original EXIF thumbnail image is left intact within the JPEG. (Also an interaction error).
- **CVE-2002-0704:** NAT feature in firewall leaks internal IP addresses in ICMP error messages.




## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.
