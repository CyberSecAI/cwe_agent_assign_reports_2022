CWE-121, **stack-based buffer overflow**, is a variant of CWE-787 and describes the location of the buffer. CWE-120, **buffer copy without checking size**, is a base CWE that describes a common cause of buffer overflows, and it can precede CWE-787. CWE-119 is a class-level CWE that is a more general description of memory buffer errors. The relationships influenced the selection by ensuring the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe120,cwe121 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of the size of the encrypted GTK value** within the WPA2 4-way handshake. This leads to a **buffer copy without checking the size** (CWE-120). Because the size is not properly checked, data is written beyond the buffer's boundaries (**out-of-bounds write**, CWE-787) on the stack (**stack-based buffer overflow**, CWE-121), resulting in remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified CWE-787 as the primary weakness, supported by the \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\". The retriever results also suggested CWE-119, CWE-190, CWE-121, and CWE-120.\n\nThe final conclusion is that the vulnerability is best represented by CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**), with additional context provided by CWE-121 (**Stack-based Buffer Overflow**) to specify the location of the buffer. The root cause is due to **buffer copy without checking size** (CWE-120).\n\nThe supporting evidence includes the vulnerability description stating a \"**stack buffer overflow**\", and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary which indicates that the `DecGTK()` function copies bytes to an output buffer (`kout`) with a fixed size of 0x80 bytes, but the size of the data copied is taken from user-controlled input (`v__size_1`) without proper bounds checking. Setting `v__size_1` to a value larger than 0x80 will cause a stack overflow, which is an **out-of-bounds write**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately describe the **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787) and the location of the buffer on the stack (CWE-121). The **lack of bounds checking** during the buffer copy contributes to the **out-of-bounds write**, which is described by CWE-120.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
