The vulnerability is rooted in an **integer truncation** (CWE-197), which subsequently leads to an integer overflow during memory allocation. This results in a heap-based buffer overflow. The evidence for this chain is present in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which states: \"The vulnerability stems from a combination of **integer truncation** and a subsequent integer overflow when calculating the allocation size for a heap buffer.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the hierarchical relationships and the chain of events. **CWE-197** is the root cause, leading to **CWE-190**, and ultimately resulting in **CWE-787** and **CWE-122**. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately represent the technical details of the vulnerability. **CWE-197** is a **Base** CWE and accurately describes the initial error. **CWE-122** is a **Variant** of buffer overflow that occurs on the heap.\n\nCWE-119 was considered but not chosen as the primary CWE because while the vulnerability does involve improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer, it is more accurately described by the more specific **CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write**. Also, the mapping guidance for CWE-119 discourages its use when lower-level CWEs are available.\n\nCWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) was considered but is not appropriate because the vulnerability is not a simple buffer copy without checking size, but rather a more complex issue involving integer truncation and overflow.",
