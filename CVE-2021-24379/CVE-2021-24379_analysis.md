# Analysis for CVE-2021-24379

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the hierarchical relationship. CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). Since the application **does not perform any authentication** for liking/disliking comments, both authentication and authorization are missing. However, the vulnerability's core issue is that it **does not prevent** unauthenticated users from performing actions that should require authorization, therefore CWE-862 is the best fit as primary, and CWE-306 as the secondary.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing server-side validation** which leads to the **missing authorization** and **missing authentication** for liking/disliking comments. This then leads to the ability to **add unlimited like/dislike to any comment** by replaying AJAX requests.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the **rootcause** of the vulnerability. The key phrase, "**missing server-side validation**" pointed towards a weakness in authorization/authentication. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section clearly states that there is "**Lack of Server-Side Validation**," allowing an attacker to bypass client-side restrictions and "**add unlimited likes/dislikes**".

The Retriever Results suggested several CWEs, including CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery), CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization). However, these were not the most accurate fit. CWE-352 requires that a well-formed request was intentionally provided, which is not the case here, since the request is coming from an unauthorized source. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) implies that authorization checks are performed, but performed incorrectly; however, here, no authorization check is made at all. CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is too generic.

The best fit is CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) because the plugin **does not perform an authorization check** to verify if the user is authorized to like/dislike the comment. Additionally, as stated in the description, the plugin allows any user, even unauthenticated, to add unlimited likes/dislikes to any comment. Therefore, it is missing Authentication as well, but that is secondary to the core issue of missing authorization.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-862 is a class level CWE, which may have base-level children that would be more appropriate, but there aren't children that better fit the vulnerability. CWE-306 is a base level CWE which aligns with the evidence that the product does not perform any authentication.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.
