CWE-798 is a child of CWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a class-level CWE and a child of both CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). CWE-287 is discouraged for direct mapping, suggesting preference for more specific child CWEs like CWE-798 or CWE-522.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe671[\"CWE-671: Improper Control of Operation Selection\"]\n    cwe344[\"CWE-344: Use of Hard-coded Configuration Settings\"]\n    \n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe344\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe671\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe287 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe613\n    cwe1390 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe798 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe287 secondary\n    class cwe1391,cwe1390,cwe671,cwe344 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of hard-coded credentials** (CWE-798), leading to **insufficient protection of credentials** (CWE-522) and ultimately resulting in an **improper authentication** (CWE-287) bypass.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-798, as evidenced by the \"Root Cause of Vulnerability\" section in \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which explicitly states that the \"vulnerability stems from insufficiently protected credentials within the Rockwell Automation's Studio 5000 Logix Designer software. Specifically, a **hardcoded key** is used for verifying communications with Logix controllers.\"\n\nCWE-522 is a secondary weakness because the hardcoded key is \"not adequately protected, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to bypass the verification mechanism.\" This highlights the **insufficient protection of credentials**, which aligns with CWE-522.\n\nCWE-287 is considered but not directly mapped because it's a more general class describing **improper authentication**, and the vulnerability description points to specific issues like the use of hardcoded credentials (CWE-798) and insufficient protection of those credentials (CWE-522), making these more precise mappings. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-287 also discourages its use when lower-level CWEs are applicable.\n\nThe selection of CWE-798 and CWE-522 provides the optimal level of specificity, addressing both the root cause and the immediate vulnerability, and is well-supported by the provided evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\n**Rationale for Not Selecting**: This is a very high-level Pillar CWE. The vulnerability description provides more specific details about the protection mechanism failure, such as hardcoded credentials, so a more specific CWE is preferred.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Rationale for Not Selecting**: This CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability is not related to reliance on untrusted inputs. The issue is the hardcoded key, not untrusted input.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Rationale for Not Selecting**: This CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability does not involve injection. The issue is the use of hardcoded credentials.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Rationale for Not Selecting**: While this is a parent of CWE-798 and relevant, CWE-798 is more specific about the \"hardcoded\" nature of the credentials.\n\n## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\n**Rationale for Not Selecting**: This CWE is too general. The description points to a specific issue (hardcoded credentials).\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Rationale for Not Selecting**: This CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability is not related to an incorrect implementation of an authentication algorithm.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Rationale for Not Selecting**: This CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability is not related to insufficient verification of data authenticity.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Rationale for Not Selecting**: While this is a parent of CWE-522 and relevant, CWE-522 is more specific.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Rationale for Selecting**: This CWE accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability.
