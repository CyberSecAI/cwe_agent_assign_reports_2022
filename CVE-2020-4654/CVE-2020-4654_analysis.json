CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, while CWE-285 and CWE-863 are Classes under it. CWE-863 is more specific than CWE-285 because it explicitly states the authorization check is performed incorrectly, aligning with the vulnerability description. The relationships are visualized below:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper permission control** (or authorization) which leads to an authenticated user being able to obtain sensitive information. This indicates a direct cause-and-effect relationship where the failed authorization is the root cause and the information disclosure is the impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **improper permission control** as the root cause. The analysis also considered the CVE Reference Links Content Summary which stated: \"The root cause is an unspecified access control vulnerability in the user interface of IBM Sterling File Gateway.\"\n\nBased on this information, CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was initially considered. However, the description also mentioned, that the authorization check is incorrectly performed when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. Therefore, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is also considered because it provides a more precise description of the weakness, where the authorization check is explicitly stated to be incorrectly performed.\n\nThe MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of high-level CWEs like CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and encourages the selection of more specific child CWEs. Therefore, selecting CWE-285 and CWE-863 is more appropriate.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision comes directly from the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The confidence level is high because the chosen CWEs accurately reflect the nature of the vulnerability as described in the provided information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
