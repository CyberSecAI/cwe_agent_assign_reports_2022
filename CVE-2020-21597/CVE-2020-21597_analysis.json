CWE-122, Heap-based Buffer Overflow, is a variant of CWE-787, specifying that the overflow occurs on the heap. CWE-119, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, is a class-level CWE that represents a more general case of memory buffer errors, with CWE-787 being a specific type of such error. The relationship is hierarchical, with CWE-119 being the parent of CWE-787, and CWE-787 being the parent of CWE-122. Selecting CWE-787 offers a balance between specificity and broad applicability, though CWE-122 is more specific, the evidence leans towards a general out-of-bounds write on the heap and not a flaw in the allocation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe122,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the processing of a crafted file, which leads to a **heap buffer overflow** in the `mc_chroma` function, resulting in a potential denial of service and arbitrary code execution.

Therefore, CWE-787 is at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Explanation:** The `mc_chroma` function in libde265 v1.0.4 writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.\n**Match:** The vulnerability description clearly states a **heap buffer overflow** due to a crafted file. The crafted file triggers the out-of-bounds write in the `mc_chroma` function.\n**Security Implications:** This can lead to denial of service or arbitrary code execution by overwriting critical data in memory.\n**Relationships:** CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) and a parent of CWE-124 (Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')).\n**Mapping Guidance:** Usage: Allowed; Rationale: at the Base level of abstraction.\n**Consideration:** CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) was considered, but this is not a simple buffer copy issue but rather a more general out-of-bounds write.\n\n## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\n**Explanation:** A buffer overflow where the overwritten buffer is allocated on the heap.\n**Match:** The vulnerability is explicitly described as a **heap buffer overflow**.\n**Security Implications:** Can lead to denial of service or arbitrary code execution.\n**Relationships:** Child of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).\n**Mapping Guidance:** Usage: Allowed; Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction.\n**Consideration:** While the vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow, the root cause is the out-of-bounds write, making CWE-787 a more fundamental classification.\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Explanation:** The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.\n**Match:** This is a general class of error that applies to buffer overflows.\n**Security Implications:** Can lead to unpredictable behavior, information disclosure, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.\n**Relationships:** Parent of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).\n**Mapping Guidance:** Usage: Discouraged; Rationale: Commonly misused, lower-level CWEs should be used instead.\n**Consideration:** CWE-119 is too general; CWE-787 provides a more specific classification of the vulnerability.",
