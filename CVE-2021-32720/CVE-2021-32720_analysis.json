The lack of proper authorization (CWE-863) is a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the information exposure. CWE-863 is assigned as a secondary CWE because it provides additional context about the nature of the authorization failure. Both CWEs are at appropriate levels of abstraction (Class) given the available information.",
