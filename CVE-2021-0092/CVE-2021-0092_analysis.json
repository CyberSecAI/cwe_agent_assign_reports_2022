CWE-1220 is a child of CWE-284, providing a more specific Base-level classification related to the granularity of access control. The selection process involved initially considering the general \"Improper Access Control\" (CWE-284) but refining it based on the description indicating that the access control, while present, lacked sufficient granularity, leading to the inclusion of CWE-1220.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe1220[\"CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe1220 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe1220 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper access control** (CWE-284), specifically **insufficient granularity** (CWE-1220) in firmware.\n2.  **Attacker Action:** Privileged user exploits the **improper access control**.\n3.  **Impact:** Denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, CWE-284, \"Improper Access Control,\" was considered due to the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning **\"Improper access control.\"** However, CWE-284 is a high-level \"Pillar\" and discouraged for use when more specific CWEs are available. The description and CVE summary indicate that the access control is present but **insufficiently granular**. This led to the inclusion of CWE-1220, \"Insufficient Granularity of Access Control,\" which is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-284.\n\nThe vulnerability description states, \"**Improper access control** in the firmware for some Intel(R) Processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable a denial of service via local access.\" This directly supports the classification of access control issues. The CVE reference links content summary reinforces this by stating, \"Root Cause of Vulnerability: - **Improper access control** in the firmware for some Intel processors.\" The CVSS vector (AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H) indicates local access, high privileges required, and a high impact on availability (denial of service).\n\nCWE-284 is a discouraged CWE, so while it is listed as the Primary CWE, it is only because the summary mentions the specific phrase. However, CWE-1220 is the better match for the actual vulnerability because the description suggests there is access control but it's not granular enough.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-691 (Insufficient Control Flow Management): While DoS could be a result, the root cause is not control flow, but access control.\n*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): Considered, but \"incorrect\" is less precise than \"insufficient granularity.\"\n*   CWE-287 (Improper Authentication): Authentication is not mentioned in the description.\n*   CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read): These are memory-related issues, not access control.",
