CWE-325 is a Base level CWE. The vulnerability also could result in sensitive information being transmitted in cleartext (CWE-319) or not encrypted at all (CWE-311). The relationship between CWE-311 and CWE-319 is a parent-child relationship, where CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is a child of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe325[\"CWE-325: Missing Cryptographic Step\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n\n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe325 primary\n    class cwe319,cwe311 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing cryptographic step** (CWE-325). This can lead to sensitive data not being encrypted (CWE-311), which in turn results in the cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319). The root cause is the missing step, and the subsequent CWEs are consequences of that flaw.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-325 (Missing Cryptographic Step) as the primary CWE, directly supported by the \"**rootcause:** **Missing Cryptographic Step**\" phrase in the vulnerability description. The \"**weakness:** **The application does not properly encrypt sensitive data during transmission or storage**\" further reinforces this, suggesting that a cryptographic process was either skipped or not fully implemented.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-325 as the top combined result.\n\nThe relationships and mapping guidance were factored into the decision. While CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) and CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) are also relevant, they represent the impact rather than the root cause. CWE-325 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly describes the **missing step** in the cryptographic process. Therefore, CWE-325 is the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
