The vulnerability is a **heap-based buffer overflow**, which is a specific type of out-of-bounds write.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **heap-based buffer overflow** (CWE-122), which leads to memory corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-122 as the primary candidate due to the **heap-based buffer overflow** described in the vulnerability. This is supported by the vulnerability description key phrases and the CVE reference links content summary, which explicitly mentions a **heap-buffer-overflow**.\n\nThe relationship analysis confirms that CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), which is consistent with the nature of the vulnerability.\n\nThe evidence provided directly supports the selection of CWE-122 as the primary CWE. The provided ASAN log, indicating a write before the allocated region's start, further supports the selection of CWE-787\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
