This results in **cleartext transmission of sensitive information** (CWE-319) and ultimately, **information disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the **incorrect access control** was the main focus, but upon further analysis, the root cause is the transmission of credentials in plaintext. The vulnerability description explicitly states that credentials are \"always returned in plain-text\" regardless of the provided password. The presence of **hardcoded password** vulnerability as indicated in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" further supports this analysis.\n\n*   The primary CWE is CWE-319 because the vulnerability description states that credentials will always be returned in plain-text from the local server during the KACO XP100U authentication process. \"Credentials will always be returned in plain-text from the local server during the KACO XP100U authentication process, regardless of whatever passwords have been provided, which leads to an information disclosure vulnerability.\".\n*   CWE-522, CWE-256, CWE-306 and CWE-863 were considered as secondary CWEs.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause and contributing factors of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses **weak credentials** (such as a default key or **hard-coded password**) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
