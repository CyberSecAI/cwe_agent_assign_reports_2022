The SQL injection leads to HTML injection. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\n\nThe primary weakness is CWE-89, **SQL injection**, due to **improper input sanitization**. CWE-78 and CWE-79 are secondary weaknesses because the **SQL injection** can lead to OS command execution and HTML injection, respectively. The parent of CWE-89 is CWE-74 which is the Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection').\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe78 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe89\n    cwe79 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe89\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe78,cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input sanitization**, leading to **SQL injection** (CWE-89). The **SQL injection** then allows for either OS command execution (CWE-78) or HTML injection (CWE-79), depending on the specific version of the affected product.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-89 as the primary weakness due to the **SQL injection** vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states that the HTTP interface is vulnerable to an unauthenticated remote **SQL injection** via a crafted HTTP request. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** also confirms this by stating that \"The HTTP interface of the Grandstream UCM6200 series has a SQL injection vulnerability in the 'Forgot Password' feature\" and the root cause is **improper input validation**.\n\nThe analysis was further refined to include CWE-78 and CWE-79 as secondary weaknesses because the **SQL injection** can be exploited to execute shell commands as root (CWE-78) or inject HTML in password recovery emails (CWE-79). This is supported by the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**, which states that \"An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute shell commands as root or inject arbitrary HTML into password recovery emails.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause and potential impacts of the vulnerability. CWE-89 is a Base-level CWE that specifically addresses **SQL injection** vulnerabilities. CWE-78 and CWE-79 are also Base-level CWEs that accurately describe the potential impacts of the **SQL injection**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nShell injection\nShell metacharacters\nOS Command Injection\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-88\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

For some people, it only refers to cases in which the attacker injects command separators into arguments for an application-controlled program that is being invoked. For some people, it refers to any type of attack that",
