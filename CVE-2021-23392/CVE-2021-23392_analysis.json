The vulnerability stems from the **inefficient regular expression** used in the `gopher_parsedir` function, which can lead to excessive CPU consumption due to catastrophic backtracking. CWE-625 (Permissive Regular Expression) is considered as a secondary candidate because the **regular expression does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values**, which contributes to the ReDoS vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe625[\"CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe625 -->|PEEROF| cwe1333\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe625 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the use of an **inefficient regular expression** (CWE-1333) within the `gopher_parsedir` function. This leads to catastrophic backtracking when processing malicious input strings, resulting in excessive CPU consumption and ultimately causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-1333 as the primary cause due to the **inefficient regular expression complexity** that leads to denial of service. The evidence supporting this includes the vulnerability description stating \"Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the gopher_parsedir function\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentioning \"The vulnerability stems from a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) flaw present in the `gopher_parsedir` function of the `locutus` npm package. The regular expression used to parse gopher directory entries was susceptible to catastrophic backtracking.\"\n\nCWE-625 was considered a secondary factor. While the **permissive nature of the regular expression** contributes to the vulnerability, the primary issue is the inefficiency that leads to resource exhaustion.\n\nThe graph relationships support the decision to prioritize CWE-1333, as it directly addresses the root cause of the ReDoS vulnerability. The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-1333 being a Base level CWE that accurately represents the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression that does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-185: Incorrect Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product specifies a regular expression in a way that causes data to be improperly matched or compared.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-186: Overly Restrictive Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA regular expression is overly restrictive, which prevents dangerous values from being detected.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-777: Regular Expression without Anchors\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression to perform neutralization, but the regular expression is not anchored and may allow malicious or malformed data to slip through.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
