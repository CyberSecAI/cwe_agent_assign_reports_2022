# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2021-23392

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1333 | Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-625 | Permissive Regular Expression | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-1333, is a Base level CWE and a child of CWE-407 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption). The vulnerability stems from the **inefficient regular expression** used in the `gopher_parsedir` function, which can lead to excessive CPU consumption due to catastrophic backtracking. CWE-625 (Permissive Regular Expression) is considered as a secondary candidate because the **regular expression does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values**, which contributes to the ReDoS vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the use of an **inefficient regular expression** (CWE-1333) within the `gopher_parsedir` function. This leads to catastrophic backtracking when processing malicious input strings, resulting in excessive CPU consumption and ultimately causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-1333 as the primary cause due to the **inefficient regular expression complexity** that leads to denial of service. The evidence supporting this includes the vulnerability description stating "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the gopher_parsedir function" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentioning "The vulnerability stems from a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) flaw present in the `gopher_parsedir` function of the `locutus` npm package. The regular expression used to parse gopher directory entries was susceptible to catastrophic backtracking."

CWE-625 was considered a secondary factor. While the **permissive nature of the regular expression** contributes to the vulnerability, the primary issue is the inefficiency that leads to resource exhaustion.

The graph relationships support the decision to prioritize CWE-1333, as it directly addresses the root cause of the ReDoS vulnerability. The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-1333 being a Base level CWE that accurately represents the weakness.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a regular expression that does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-185: Incorrect Regular Expression
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product specifies a regular expression in a way that causes data to be improperly matched or compared.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-186: Overly Restrictive Regular Expression
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A regular expression is overly restrictive, which prevents dangerous values from being detected.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-777: Regular Expression without Anchors
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a regular expression to perform neutralization, but the regular expression is not anchored and may allow malicious or malformed data to slip through.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.
