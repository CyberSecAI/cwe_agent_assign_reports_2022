The description of CWE-497 directly aligns with the vulnerability where sensitive system information is exposed to unauthorized actors. CWE-497 is a child of CWE-200, a more general class of information exposure. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is also related because the vulnerability involves bypassing intended security restrictions.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe497 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **flaw** in the Elasticsearch suggester and profile API. Because of **certain queries**, the profiler and suggester are enabled when they shouldn't be. This leads to a bypass of document and field level security which then leads to **disclosure of the existence of documents and fields** the attacker should not be able to view. The root cause is the **improper** enabling of the suggester and profile APIs, and the impact is information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified several potential CWEs, but after careful consideration of the vulnerability description and the provided CWE specifications, CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) appears to be the most appropriate primary mapping.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that a **document disclosure flaw** exists in Elasticsearch, leading to the **disclosing the existence of documents and fields** the attacker should not be able to view. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary section confirms that the **root cause** is a flaw in the Elasticsearch suggester and profile API, which can be **bypassed** by certain queries even when Document and Field Level Security are enabled.\n\nThe retriever results also support this selection, with CWE-497 having a high similarity score. The CWE description aligns well with the vulnerability, as it involves the product not properly preventing sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered but ultimately deemed less specific. While the vulnerability does involve information exposure, CWE-497 provides a more precise description of the issue. CWE-200 is discouraged as a primary mapping due to its generality.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was also considered, but it is more of a general class. The vulnerability description highlights the fact that the queries are able to enable the profiler and suggester when they should be disabled by document-level security.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-497 being a Base level CWE that accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
