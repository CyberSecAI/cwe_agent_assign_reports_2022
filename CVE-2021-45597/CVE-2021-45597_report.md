## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-77 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') | 1.0 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-77 which is a Class level CWE. The description focuses on the **command injection** weakness and the fact that an authenticated user can inject commands. CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77, representing a more specific case of OS command injection. The vulnerability description doesn't explicitly state that the injection is limited to OS commands, so the higher-level CWE-77 is initially more appropriate. However, given the prevalent use of OS command injection, and the strong similarity in root cause, I've included CWE-78 as a secondary candidate.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements in a command. An authenticated user provides malicious input, which is then used to construct a command. Because the input is not properly neutralized, the attacker can inject commands, leading to arbitrary command execution.
- Root Cause: **Improper neutralization** of special elements in a command (CWE-77).
- Weakness: Command Injection.
- Impact: Arbitrary command execution.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, the vulnerability description clearly points to **command injection**, making CWE-77 the most appropriate primary choice. The description states that an authenticated user can inject commands, which aligns with the definition of CWE-77. The "CWE for similar CVE Descriptions" also lists CWE-77 as the primary match. The retriever results also list CWE-77 with a score of 1.0. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms the presence of a post-authentication command injection vulnerability.

While CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) is a strong candidate, the vulnerability description doesn't explicitly limit the scope to OS commands. Therefore, CWE-77, being a broader classification, is a more accurate primary mapping. However, considering the prevalence of OS command injection vulnerabilities and the potential for this specific instance to involve OS commands, CWE-78 is included as a secondary candidate.

The final decision is based on the provided evidence, the CWE relationships, and the mapping guidance. The selection of CWE-77 as the primary CWE is at an optimal level of specificity, given the available information.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Used**: This vulnerability is not related to HTTP headers or CRLF sequences.

## CWE-162: Improper Neutralization of Trailing Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes trailing special elements that could be interpreted in unexpected ways when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Used**: This vulnerability is not specifically about trailing special elements.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

**Why Not Used**: CWE-74 is a class-level CWE, and more specific CWEs like CWE-77 are more appropriate.

## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Used**: This vulnerability is not specifically about Expression Language injection.

## CWE-150: Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as escape, meta, or control character sequences when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Used**: The description does not specifically mention escape, meta, or control sequences.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Used**: This vulnerability is not related to unsafe equivalence in input.

## CWE-99: Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the input before it is used as an identifier for a resource that may be outside the intended sphere of control.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

**Why Not Used**: This vulnerability is not about controlling resource identifiers.

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.
