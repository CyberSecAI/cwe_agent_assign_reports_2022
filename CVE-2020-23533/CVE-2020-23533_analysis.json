It is a child of CWE-345, Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity, indicating a more general category of weakness. While CWE-345 is a Class, CWE-347 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability.\nCWE-798 is also considered because the authentication code is generated based on a secret key which is NULL; this means the secret key can be considered hardcoded. CWE-798 is a peer of CWE-257 Storing Passwords in Recoverable Format. It is a child of CWE-1391 Use of Weak Credentials and CWE-287 Improper Authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n    class cwe345,cwe1391,cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature (CWE-347)**, specifically because the secret key is NULL, possibly leading to a **Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798)**. This allows attackers to craft authentication codes and shop for free.\nRoot Cause: **Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature (CWE-347)**\nImpact: Attackers can shop for free.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified CWE-347 as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description which explicitly states \"**Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature**\". The crafted authentication code (MAC) also aligns with the characteristics of CWE-347, further solidifying this mapping.\n\nThe retriever results also ranked CWE-347 as the top match, reinforcing the initial assessment.\n\nThe relationship analysis, particularly the parent-child relationship between CWE-347 and CWE-345, was crucial in confirming the specificity of the chosen CWE.\n\nThe final decision is based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description, the retriever results, and the relationship analysis. CWE-347 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the improper verification of the cryptographic signature. CWE-798 is added as a secondary candidate because the authentication code is generated based on a secret key which is NULL; this means the secret key can be considered hardcoded.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
