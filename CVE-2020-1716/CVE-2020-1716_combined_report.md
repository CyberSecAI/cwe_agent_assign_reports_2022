## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-259, a variant of CWE-798. CWE-798 is a more general base CWE that describes the use of **hard-coded credentials**, while CWE-259 specifically refers to **hard-coded passwords**. CWE-1393 (Use of Default Password) is also relevant as the **hard-coded passwords** are being used as default passwords.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **hardcoded passwords** in the `ceph-ansible` playbook, which leads to the ability for an authenticated attacker to brute-force Ceph deployments. This, in turn, grants the attacker administrator access to Ceph clusters, allowing them to read, write, and delete Ceph clusters and modify Ceph cluster configurations.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is the use of **hard-coded passwords** in the `ceph-ansible` playbook. This directly matches CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password), which is a variant-level CWE and is therefore more specific than its parent, CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials). The vulnerability description states "A flaw was found in the ceph-ansible playbook where it contained **hardcoded passwords** that were being used as default passwords while deploying Ceph services." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also mentions that the root cause of the vulnerability is that "The `ceph-ansible` playbook contained hardcoded default passwords within the `roles/ceph-defaults/defaults/main.yml` file" and that "**Hardcoded Credentials:** The presence of hardcoded passwords constitutes a significant security vulnerability."

I considered CWE-1393 (Use of Default Password) because the **hardcoded passwords** are being used as default passwords. However, the core issue is the hardcoding itself, so CWE-259 is the more direct representation.

Other CWEs considered but not used:

*   CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File), CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')), CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), CWE-117 (Improper Output Neutralization for Logs), CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), and CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data): These CWEs do not directly relate to the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the presence of **hard-coded passwords**. They represent different types of weaknesses.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.

### Extended Description


A hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:

```
		Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.
		Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.
```
In the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.

The Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry could be split into multiple variants: an inbound variant (as seen in the second demonstrative example) and an outbound variant (as seen in the first demonstrative example). These variants are likely to have different consequences, detectability, etc. More importantly, from a vulnerability theory perspective, they could be characterized as different behaviors.

- **CVE-2021-35033:** Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port




## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

### Extended Description


By design, authentication protocols try to ensure that attackers must perform brute force attacks if they do not know the credentials such as a key or password. However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.


Credentials may be weak for different reasons, such as:


  - Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)

  - Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)

  - Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be guessed with reasonable efficiency)

Even if a new, unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.

## CWE-1393: Use of Default Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses default passwords for potentially critical functionality.

### Extended Description
It is common practice for products to be designed to use default passwords for authentication. The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise. However, if admins do not change the defaults, then it makes it easier for attackers to quickly bypass authentication across multiple organizations. There are many lists of default passwords and default-password scanning tools that are easily available from the World Wide Web.

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

### Extended Description


There are two main variations:


  - Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials. In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.
