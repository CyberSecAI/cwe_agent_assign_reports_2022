The product contains a **hard-coded password**, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components. |\n| CWE-798 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The product contains **hard-coded credentials**, such as a password or cryptographic key. |\n| CWE-1393 | Use of Default Password | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The product uses **default passwords** for potentially critical functionality. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-259, a variant of CWE-798. CWE-798 is a more general base CWE that describes the use of **hard-coded credentials**, while CWE-259 specifically refers to **hard-coded passwords**. CWE-1393 (Use of Default Password) is also relevant as the **hard-coded passwords** are being used as default passwords.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe1393[\"CWE-1393: Use of Default Password\"]\n    \n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe1393 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe259 primary\n    class cwe798,cwe1393 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **hardcoded passwords** in the `ceph-ansible` playbook, which leads to the ability for an authenticated attacker to brute-force Ceph deployments. This, in turn, grants the attacker administrator access to Ceph clusters, allowing them to read, write, and delete Ceph clusters and modify Ceph cluster configurations.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the use of **hard-coded passwords** in the `ceph-ansible` playbook. This directly matches CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password), which is a variant-level CWE and is therefore more specific than its parent, CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials). The vulnerability description states \"A flaw was found in the ceph-ansible playbook where it contained **hardcoded passwords** that were being used as default passwords while deploying Ceph services.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also mentions that the root cause of the vulnerability is that \"The `ceph-ansible` playbook contained hardcoded default passwords within the `roles/ceph-defaults/defaults/main.yml` file\" and that \"**Hardcoded Credentials:** The presence of hardcoded passwords constitutes a significant security vulnerability.\"\n\nI considered CWE-1393 (Use of Default Password) because the **hardcoded passwords** are being used as default passwords. However, the core issue is the hardcoding itself, so CWE-259 is the more direct representation.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File), CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')), CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), CWE-117 (Improper Output Neutralization for Logs), CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), and CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data): These CWEs do not directly relate to the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the presence of **hard-coded passwords**. They represent different types of weaknesses.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains **hard-coded credentials**, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or **hard-coded password**) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
