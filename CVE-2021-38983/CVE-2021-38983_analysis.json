CWE-327's description states that it is used when a product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol. Its parent is CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure. CWE-326 is a peer of CWE-327, and could be considered as well. The vulnerability description **uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms**, which aligns well with CWE-327's description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe326[\"CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    \n    cwe327 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe326 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe327 -- PEEROF -- cwe326\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe327 primary\n    class cwe326 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms** (CWE-327)\n2.  **Impact:** An attacker could decrypt highly sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-327 as the primary candidate based on the vulnerability description stating that the software **uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms**. This aligns with CWE-327, which covers the use of broken or risky cryptographic algorithms. The Retriever Results also list CWE-327 as a top candidate.\n\nThe vulnerability description key phrases also point to **uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms**, which supports the use of CWE-327.\n\nThe final decision is to select CWE-327 as the primary CWE because it accurately describes the vulnerability's root cause. It is at the Class level of abstraction, as it describes a general category of weakness. CWE-326 is a peer of CWE-327, and could be considered as well.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.85\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-1240 was considered but not chosen because the description doesn't explicitly state that the implementation is non-standard, unproven, or disallowed.\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-328 was considered but rejected because the vulnerability description focuses on general cryptographic algorithms rather than specifically weak hashing algorithms.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\nCWE-1391 was considered but not chosen because the vulnerability does not directly relate to weak credentials.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
