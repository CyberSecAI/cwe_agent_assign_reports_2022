While the primary evidence points towards a double free, some sources mention a use-after-free condition, indicating a potential overlap or related issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe415[\"CWE-415: Double Free\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe1341[\"CWE-1341: Multiple Releases of Same Resource or Handle\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on a Resource after Expiration\"]\n    cwe666[\"CWE-666: Operation at Incorrect Layer of Abstraction\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    cwe364[\"CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n\n    cwe415 -->|ChildOf| cwe825\n    cwe415 -->|ChildOf| cwe1341\n    cwe415 -->|ChildOf| cwe672\n    cwe415 -->|ChildOf| cwe666\n    cwe415 -->|PeerOf| cwe416\n\n    cwe416 -->|ChildOf| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|ChildOf| cwe672\n    cwe416 -->|CanPrecede| cwe120\n\n    cwe364 -->|CanPrecede| cwe415\n    cwe364 -->|CanPrecede| cwe416\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe415 primary\n    class cwe416 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain, based on the evidence, starts with a crafted file leading to a **double free**, which results in a denial of service. Some reports suggest the possibility of a use-after-free condition which has the same root cause of memory corruption.\n- Crafted File -> **Double Free** or **Use-After-Free** -> Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the provided vulnerability description that highlighted a **double free** vulnerability. The description key phrases explicitly mention \"**double free**\" as the **weakness**. Further investigation of the CVE reference links confirmed this, with multiple sources directly stating \"**double free**\" as the root cause. For instance, \"A double free vulnerability in radare2 in the pyc parsing logic when processing a crafted file\" and \"The iaito package was updated to include a fix for a double-free vulnerability related to CVE-2021-32613\". This evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-415 (**Double Free**) as the primary CWE.\n\nHowever, some sources also mention \"Heap-use-after-free\" or \"Use-after-free\" as a weakness and rootcause. This overlap motivated the inclusion of CWE-416 (**Use After Free**) as a secondary candidate, due to their peer relationship. The vulnerability descriptions and the CVE reference links content summary clearly indicate a **double free** vulnerability, making CWE-415 the most specific and accurate classification. Therefore I am classifying it as the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1341: Multiple Releases of Same Resource or Handle\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to close or release a resource or handle more than once, without any successful open between the close operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-775: Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release a file descriptor or handle after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the file descriptor/handle is no longer needed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale",
