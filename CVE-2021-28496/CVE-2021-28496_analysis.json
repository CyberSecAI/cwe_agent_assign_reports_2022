It has child relationships to CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), but those are not as applicable. CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) is a Base-level weakness and a child of CWE-522, indicating a more specific form of credential protection failure. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information) is a more general Class-level weakness that is often misused, making CWE-522 a better fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe522 primary\n    class cwe256,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the **improper handling of BFD passwords**, leading to their **exposure via eAPI or JSON outputs** to authenticated users. This results in the **leakage of sensitive credentials**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-522 as the primary weakness due to the **insufficient protection of credentials**. The vulnerability description clearly states that the **password** configured for BFD is **leaked** when displaying output over eAPI or other JSON outputs. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states the **root cause** as the **exposure of the BFD password** due to insufficient access control.\n\nCWE-256 was considered as a more specific Base-level weakness, but the description doesn't explicitly say that the password was stored in plaintext, so it is a possible secondary weakness.\n\nCWE-200 was considered but is discouraged by MITRE as it is often misused as a general loss of confidentiality. The vulnerability is more specifically related to the **insufficient protection of credentials** rather than a general information exposure.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-522 capturing the core issue of credential protection and CWE-256 potentially adding further context if the passwords are indeed stored in plaintext.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE was not selected as the vulnerability does not explicitly involve the placement of sensitive information into files or directories, but rather exposure through eAPI or JSON outputs.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE was not selected as the vulnerability doesn't explicitly involve improper removal of sensitive information before storage or transfer.
