It is a child of CWE-1390, CWE-287, and CWE-668. CWE-257 [CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format] is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-522, making it a more specific potential mapping. CWE-798 [CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials] is also a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-1391, CWE-287, CWE-344, and CWE-671 and a PeerOf CWE-257. Since the description mentions \"**insufficiently protected credentials**\" and the impact is disclosing credentials, CWE-522 is a good starting point. The retriever results also show CWE-522 as the top result.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe257[\"CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Reliance on Cryptographically-Weak Algorithm\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    cwe344[\"CWE-344: Use of Predictable Algorithm\"]\n    cwe671[\"CWE-671: Incorrect Behavior Order: Save before Check\"]\n\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe257 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe344\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe671\n    cwe798 --|PEEROF| cwe257\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe522 primary\n    class cwe257,cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficiently protected credentials**, leading to the disclosure of third-party device credentials. The attacker exploits this by accessing a configuration page.\n\n`Insufficiently Protected Credentials` -> `Disclosure of Credentials` -> `Unauthorized Access to Third-Party Devices`\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the description points to CWE-522 [CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials] as the primary weakness, due to the **root cause** being \"**insufficiently protected credentials**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section supports this, stating that the credentials are \"stored or displayed in a manner accessible to authenticated users through the WebUI configuration page, which should be protected\".\n\nCWE-257 [CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format] was considered because the credentials may be stored in a way that they can be recovered. However, there is not enough information to confirm if they are stored in a recoverable format. The description only states they are accessible through the configuration page.\n\nCWE-798 [CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials] was also considered because the credentials could be hard-coded. However, the description doesn't mention hard-coded credentials. The focus is on the **insufficient protection** of existing credentials, not necessarily that they are hard-coded.\n\nThe evidence strongly supports CWE-522 [CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials] as the primary CWE because it aligns directly with the \"**insufficiently protected credentials**\" **root cause** and the \"Credentials stored or displayed in a manner accessible to authenticated users\" statement from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The other CWEs are possibilities, but there isn't strong evidence to support them.\n\nBased on the available evidence, CWE-522 [CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials] is the most appropriate and specific CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:",
