While it may have more specific children, the description aligns well with the root cause described in the CVE details: excessive recursion in the parser functions. The secondary weakness is **CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow**, a Variant-level CWE, because the uncontrolled recursion leads to stack exhaustion. CWE-674 is a child of CWE-834, which suggests a resource exhaustion issue. CWE-121 is a child of CWE-787 and CWE-788, indicating improper access to memory.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Allocation Within a Loop\"]\n    \n    cwe674 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    cwe121 -->|RESULT| cwe674\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe674 primary\n    class cwe121 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **uncontrolled recursion** (CWE-674), leading to **stack exhaustion** and ultimately a **stack-based buffer overflow** (CWE-121), resulting in a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the provided vulnerability description, which highlighted a **stack overflow** vulnerability. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary provided valuable context, indicating that the root cause was **excessive recursion** in the parser functions of the mjs JavaScript engine. This led to considering **CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion** as the primary weakness. The **stack overflow** was then classified as a **CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow**, which is the result of the uncontrolled recursion.\n\nThe assessment is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states: \"The vulnerability is caused by **excessive recursion** in the parser functions of the mjs JavaScript engine.\" and \"A **stack overflow** occurs when parsing a crafted JavaScript payload, leading to a crash of the application.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with **CWE-674 Uncontrolled Recursion** accurately representing the root cause and **CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow** describing the resulting buffer overflow condition.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context

Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**:

Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not

the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE

Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6115.97\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
