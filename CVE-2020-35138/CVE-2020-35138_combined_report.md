## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **hardcoded encryption key** (CWE-321), which allows attackers to decrypt captured traffic or construct their own authentication requests. This could lead to credential theft and account compromise. Since the key is hardcoded, the encryption is ineffective. If the encryption is bypassed or broken, sensitive information could be transmitted in cleartext (CWE-319).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified the **hardcoded encryption key** as the primary weakness, leading to the selection of CWE-321. This assessment is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" which states "**rootcause:** **hardcoded encryption key**" and the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" which states "The root cause of this vulnerability is the presence of a hardcoded encryption key within the MobileIron Mobile@Work agent application." The graph relationships reinforce this, with CWE-321 being a child of CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials), and potentially leading to CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) if the key is used in transit.

The selection of CWE-321 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the core issue of a hardcoded cryptographic key. While CWE-798 is a parent, CWE-321 provides a more precise classification.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2020-35138

## Vulnerability Description
The MobileIron agents through 2021-03-22 for Android and iOS contain a **hardcoded encryption key**, used to encrypt the submission of username/password details during the authentication process, as demonstrated by Mobile@Work (aka com.mobileiron). The key is in the com/mobileiron/common/utils/C4928m.java file. NOTE It has been asserted that there is no causality or connection between credential encryption and the MiTM attack

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **hardcoded encryption key**
- **product:** MobileIron agents
- **version:** through 2021-03-22

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-35138:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

-   The root cause of this vulnerability is the presence of a hardcoded encryption key within the MobileIron Mobile@Work agent application. This key is used to encrypt sensitive data, specifically the username, password, and PIN, before it's transmitted to the MobileIron server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Hardcoded Encryption Key:** The primary vulnerability is that the encryption key is hardcoded into the Mobile@Work agent. This allows an attacker to extract this key via reverse engineering of the application.
-   **Insecure Encryption:** Although the data is encrypted, the use of a static, hardcoded key makes the encryption ineffective as a security measure once the key is compromised.
-   **Lack of TLS Certificate Validation:** The Mobile@Work client does not validate the TLS certificate chain by default, relying instead on the mobile device's trust store. This makes man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks easier, although it's noted that enabling mutual certificate authentication will enable TLS validation.
-   **No Account Lockout Protection:** The MobileIron endpoint does not implement proper account lockout protection for authentication attempts. Lockouts are local to MobileIron and have a short duration (30 seconds). This allows for brute-force and user enumeration attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Credential Theft:** With the hardcoded encryption key, an attacker can decrypt captured MobileIron traffic, potentially revealing user credentials if a man-in-the-middle attack is performed, or construct their own valid authentication requests.
-   **Account Compromise:** By bypassing the client application and directly constructing requests, attackers can perform single-factor authentication attacks against user accounts. If successful they can gain access to internal corporate resources, VPN and employee emails by registering an attacker controlled mobile device.
-   **User Enumeration:** The lack of account lockout combined with different responses for valid, disabled/locked, and invalid user accounts allows attackers to enumerate valid user accounts.
-   **Brute-Force PIN Attacks:** Single-use PIN codes are vulnerable to brute-force attacks due to a lack of rate limiting.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Reverse Engineering:** The hardcoded key is extracted from the Mobile@Work agent application (APK/IPA) via reverse engineering.
-   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Attackers can perform MitM attacks by injecting a malicious TLS certificate if the device is compromised or a user can be coerced into installing a malicious certificate.
-   **Direct API Access:** The attacker can directly construct and submit authentication requests to the MobileIron server, bypassing the Mobile@Work client entirely.
-   **Network Attacks:** An attacker can intercept network traffic between the Mobile@Work client and the MobileIron server to capture encrypted data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Technical Expertise:** Requires the ability to perform static analysis of mobile applications, understand networking protocols, and potentially perform MitM attacks.
-   **Access to Mobile@Work Agent:** Requires the ability to obtain and decompile/decrypt the Mobile@Work agent (APK or IPA).
-   **Network Access:** Network access to the MobileIron authentication endpoint is required, either directly over the internet, or via a compromised network position for MitM.

**Additional Information:**

-   The vulnerability can be exploited using the `rustyIron` tool, which was created by the researchers to test MobileIron security issues.
-   MobileIron acknowledges the issue but states that the risk is reduced by the use of TLS and other security measures. They also suggest configuration changes like enabling mutual certificate authentication, but this doesn't address the main vulnerability.
-  MobileIron also suggests using PIN-based authentication which can help mitigate user enumeration; however the PIN values are also vulnerable to brute-force attacks
-   The provided content provides a detailed technical analysis of the MobileIron protocol and the encryption process.
-   Ivanti disputes the severity of the vulnerabilities, arguing that the identified issues are applicable to any software and cloud vendor, and that the server was likely not hardened properly when tested by Optiv. They also state that password and PIN lockout settings can be configured in the MobileIron core.

**In summary, CVE-2020-35138 is due to the insecure storage of a static encryption key in the MobileIron client that allows an attacker to bypass some authentication and security measures to potentially compromise user accounts on the MobileIron platform.**

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples

## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.

### Extended Description
When a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client.

- **CVE-2014-1266:** chain: incorrect "goto" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple "goto fail" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).
- **CVE-2021-22909:** Chain: router's firmware update procedure uses curl with "-k" (insecure) option that disables certificate validation (CWE-295), allowing adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) compromise with a malicious firmware image (CWE-494).




## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

### Extended Description


There are two main variations:


  - Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials. In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.

  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.

- **CVE-2022-29964:** Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access




## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

- **CVE-2022-31204:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends password in plaintext.




## CWE-1273: Device Unlock Credential Sharing
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The credentials necessary for unlocking a device are shared across multiple parties and may expose sensitive information.

### Extended Description


"Unlocking a device" often means activating certain unadvertised debug and manufacturer-specific capabilities of a device using sensitive credentials. Unlocking a device might be necessary for the purpose of troubleshooting device problems. For example, suppose a device contains the ability to dump the content of the full system memory by disabling the memory-protection mechanisms. Since this is a highly security-sensitive capability, this capability is "locked" in the production part. Unless the device gets unlocked by supplying the proper credentials, the debug capabilities are not available. For cases where the chip designer, chip manufacturer (fabricator), and manufacturing and assembly testers are all employed by the same company, the risk of compromise of the credentials is greatly reduced. However, the risk is greater when the chip designer is employed by one company, the chip manufacturer is employed by another company (a foundry), and the assemblers and testers are employed by yet a third company. Since these different companies will need to perform various tests on the device to verify correct device function, they all need to share the unlock key. Unfortunately, the level of secrecy and policy might be quite different at each company, greatly increasing the risk of sensitive credentials being compromised.

## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

### Extended Description
In security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Often primary in cryptographic applications and algorithms.

**[Maintenance]** CWE 4.16 removed a demonstrative example for a hardware module because it was inaccurate and unable to be adapted. The CWE team is developing an alternative.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies
- **CVE-2019-10482:** Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels
- **CVE-2014-0984:** Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.




## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.

### Extended Description


A hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:

```
		Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.
		Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.
```
In the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.

The Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry could be split into multiple variants: an inbound variant (as seen in the second demonstrative example) and an outbound variant (as seen in the first demonstrative example). These variants are likely to have different consequences, detectability, etc. More importantly, from a vulnerability theory perspective, they could be characterized as different behaviors.
