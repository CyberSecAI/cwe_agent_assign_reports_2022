# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-321 | Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-798 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-321, which is a variant of CWE-798. The hardcoded key results in sensitive information being transmitted using weak encryption which may be sniffed, leading to CWE-319.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **hardcoded encryption key** (CWE-321), which allows attackers to decrypt captured traffic or construct their own authentication requests. This could lead to credential theft and account compromise. Since the key is hardcoded, the encryption is ineffective. If the encryption is bypassed or broken, sensitive information could be transmitted in cleartext (CWE-319).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified the **hardcoded encryption key** as the primary weakness, leading to the selection of CWE-321. This assessment is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" which states "**rootcause:** **hardcoded encryption key**" and the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" which states "The root cause of this vulnerability is the presence of a hardcoded encryption key within the MobileIron Mobile@Work agent application." The graph relationships reinforce this, with CWE-321 being a child of CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials), and potentially leading to CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) if the key is used in transit.

The selection of CWE-321 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the core issue of a hardcoded cryptographic key. While CWE-798 is a parent, CWE-321 provides a more precise classification.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
To fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.
