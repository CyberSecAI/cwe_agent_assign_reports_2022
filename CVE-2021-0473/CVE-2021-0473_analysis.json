The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **double free**, making CWE-415 the most direct and specific match. The **uninitialized data** root cause suggests that CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource) may have preceded the double free.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe415[\"CWE-415: Double Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe1341[\"CWE-1341: Multiple Releases of Same Resource or Handle\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    cwe908[\"CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\"]\n\n    cwe415 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe415 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1341\n    cwe415 -->|PEEROF| cwe416\n    cwe415 -->|PEEROF| cwe123\n    cwe415 <--|CANFOLLOW| cwe908\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe415 primary\n    class cwe908 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **uninitialized data** (CWE-908) leading to a **double free** (CWE-415). The double free could then lead to remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **double free** as the primary weakness based on the vulnerability description. The retriever results and relationship analysis supported this finding, with CWE-415 being a Variant-level CWE and explicitly describing the double free condition. The **uninitialized data** was identified as the root cause using the vulnerability description key phrases.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary is strong. The description explicitly mentions \"**double free** due to **uninitialized data**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary details the \"Double Free: Attempting to free the same memory location more than once\" and lists Memory Disclosure, OOB Write, and Double Free as related issues.\n\nThe selection of CWE-415 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **double free** condition, which is a Variant level CWE. CWE-908 describes the **uninitialized data** root cause, which is a Base level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Rationale for exclusion:* This vulnerability isn't related to locking mechanisms.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Rationale for exclusion:* While a double free is related to resource release, CWE-415 is a more specific match.\n\n## CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Rationale for exclusion:* The vulnerability isn't explicitly related to synchronization issues, but is due to an uninitialized resource.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Rationale for exclusion:* There isn't explicit evidence of a race condition.\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Rationale for exclusion:* There isn't explicit evidence of a race condition.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Rationale for exclusion:* This is about leaking sensitive info, but the vulnerability is about a double free.\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Rationale for exclusion:* The root cause is **uninitialized data**, but CWE-908 is a better fit, as it is a more specific base level CWE.\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Rationale for exclusion:* Not related to checking conditions.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Rationale for exclusion:* Not related to integer handling.\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TO",
