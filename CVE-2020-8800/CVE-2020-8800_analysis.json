It is related to CWE-913 (Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources) as a child. CWE-502 is also a peer of CWE-915 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes). The relationships indicate that the core issue is related to the deserialization process, and the resulting impact might involve modifying object attributes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n    cwe915[\"CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\"]\n    \n    cwe502 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe915 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe502 -- PEEROF --> cwe915\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe502 primary\n    class cwe915 secondary\n    class cwe913 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insecure deserialization (CWE-502)** of untrusted data, leading to **PHP Object Injection**. This can further lead to **arbitrary PHP code execution**, which is the final impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** mentioning \"**PHP Object Injection**\", strongly suggests **CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data)** as the primary weakness. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms that the root cause is the **insecure use of the `unserialize()` function** on user-controlled data, enabling **PHP Object Injection**. This confirms that the vulnerability arises from **deserialization of untrusted data** without proper validation, which aligns perfectly with CWE-502.\n\nCWE-915 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes) was also considered, given its peer relationship with CWE-502 and the potential for object attribute modification as a result of the injection. While possible, the primary issue is the unsafe deserialization itself.\n\nThe graph relationships support the selection of CWE-502 as the primary weakness, with CWE-915 as a secondary consideration. The provided evidence clearly points to the insecure deserialization as the root cause.\n\nThe choice of CWE-502 is at the optimal level of specificity, being a base-level CWE that accurately describes the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1236: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by a spreadsheet product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
