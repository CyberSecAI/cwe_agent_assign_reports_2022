This indicates that SQL Injection is a specific type of injection vulnerability. Also, CWE-201 can follow CWE-226.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe226[\"CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe226 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe201\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe201,cwe226 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of user-supplied input in the `SearchableTrait#scopeSearch()` function, leading to **SQL injection**, which then allows an attacker to **exfiltrate sensitive data**.\n  - Root Cause: **Improper Neutralization of Input**\n  - Weakness: **SQL Injection** (CWE-89)\n  - Impact: **Sensitive Data Exfiltration** (CWE-201)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identifies **SQL injection** as the primary **weakness**, supported by the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The final selection emphasizes CWE-89 as the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. The retriever results further confirm this choice, with CWE-89 having the highest score. The evidence is strong, and the decision is based on direct evidence and relationship insights.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that there is a **SQL injection** in the `SearchableTrait#scopeSearch()` function. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the `scopeSearch()` function does not properly sanitize user-provided search parameters before using them in a database query. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code and exfiltrate sensitive data.\n\nCWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')) is the most appropriate CWE because it specifically describes the **weakness** where user-controllable input is not properly neutralized, leading to the execution of unintended SQL commands. This aligns directly with the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is considered as a secondary CWE because the **impact** of the SQL injection is the exfiltration of sensitive data. While not the primary **weakness**, it represents a significant consequence of the vulnerability.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but not chosen:\n\n*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')): While there is improper neutralization of input, the context is SQL, not web page generation.\n*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key): Although the vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, the root cause is not an authorization issue, but rather a lack of input sanitization that leads to SQL injection.\n*   CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): While the vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, the root cause is SQL Injection and not the missing authentication.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory",
