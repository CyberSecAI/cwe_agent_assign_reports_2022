CWE-416 is a peer of CWE-787, representing another common memory corruption issue. The abstraction levels influenced the selection by favoring the base level CWE-787 and the variant level CWE-416 over the class level CWE-119.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe416 -->|PEEROF| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe416,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **memory safety bugs**, which can lead to **memory corruption**, and ultimately allows for arbitrary code execution. This represents a direct path from the root cause to the impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, which explicitly mentions \"**memory safety bugs**\" leading to \"**memory corruption**\". The description also states that exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 as the primary CWE is justified because it directly addresses the \"out-of-bounds write\" condition, which is a common type of memory corruption. The retriever results and the primary CWE match listing also supports this selection.\n\nCWE-416 is included as a secondary candidate because it's another common memory corruption issue, \"use after free,\" and might be present in addition to out-of-bounds writes.\n\nCWE-119 is considered but classified as a secondary candidate because it is a higher-level class that encompasses both CWE-787 and potentially CWE-416. The mapping guidance discourages using CWE-119 directly when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they represent the most likely root causes of the described memory corruption.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product violates well-established principles for secure design.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
