The vulnerability involves **improper sanitization** of data from untrusted sources, indicating a failure to validate input properly. Subsequently, the unsanitized data is displayed, leading to potential terminal manipulation, pointing to output encoding issues. The choice of CWE-20 as primary and CWE-116 as secondary reflects this sequence. Both are Class level CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe116\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper sanitization** (lack of input validation), leading to the potential for injecting malicious data, and culminates in terminal manipulation due to lack of output sanitization.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20)\n  - **Weakness:** **Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output** (CWE-116)\n  - **Impact:** Deceptive information displayed on terminal screen, potential for arbitrary code execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description points to **improper sanitization** as the root cause. The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms this by stating, \"Helm did not properly validate and sanitize input data from various sources, allowing for the injection of malicious data.\" This strongly supports the selection of CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation**. The subsequent impact, \"The application failed to sanitize data before displaying it on the user's terminal, leading to potential terminal manipulation,\" indicates a secondary weakness related to output encoding, leading to the inclusion of CWE-116 **Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output**.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-20 can precede CWE-116, meaning that improper input validation can lead to improper output handling. This relationship, combined with the evidence, makes CWE-20 the primary weakness.\n\nBoth selected CWEs are at the Class level. While more specific Base or Variant level CWEs exist, the provided information does not offer sufficient detail to justify a more granular classification. The decision is based on balancing specificity with the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
