While the vulnerability description specifies \"**command injection**,\" it does not explicitly state whether it is OS command injection or some other form of command injection. CWE-77, being a class-level CWE, is more general than CWE-78 (Base). The tool's retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-77. CWE-74 is a parent of CWE-77, but it's too general and discouraged by MITRE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe77 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe77 primary\n    class cwe78,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements in a command. This leads to the ability to inject commands, which, in turn, can lead to arbitrary command execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **command injection** weakness. The evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" clearly indicates \"**command injection**\" as the **weakness**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also mentions \"post-authentication command injection vulnerability.\"\n\nThe retriever results and the \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section both point to CWE-77 as the primary candidate. However, given that OS command injection is a common occurrence, CWE-78 was also considered, although less specific.\n\nThe final decision was to primarily map to CWE-77 because it aligns with the vulnerability description and the retriever results. The mapping guidance for CWE-77 suggests reviewing whether OS command injection (CWE-78) is more appropriate. While there's no specific evidence to confirm it's OS command injection, it remains a plausible secondary mapping. CWE-74 is too general, as it encompasses all types of injection. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity based on the available evidence.\n```",
