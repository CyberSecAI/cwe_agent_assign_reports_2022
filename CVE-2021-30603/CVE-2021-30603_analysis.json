The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **data race** condition. CWE-366 is a child of CWE-362 \"Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\", which is a class-level CWE. Given the specificity of a thread-level race condition in the description, CWE-366 is the more appropriate choice. The retriever also provides CWE-416 \"Use After Free\" and CWE-787 \"Out-of-Bounds Write\" which are potential impacts of the race condition. The final impact described is heap corruption which can be caused by out-of-bounds writes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe366[\"CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe366 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe416 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe366\n    cwe787 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe366\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe366 primary\n    class cwe416,cwe787,cwe362 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **data race** condition (CWE-366) in the WebAudio component, which can lead to heap corruption. Heap corruption can be caused by use-after-free (CWE-416) or out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). Therefore the chain is: CWE-366 -> CWE-416/CWE-787.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **data race** as the primary issue, aligning with CWE-366. The retriever results supported this by highlighting CWE-366, CWE-416, and CWE-787. The explicit mention of **data race** in the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary (\"Race condition in WebAudio\") strongly suggests CWE-366 as the root cause. The final impact is heap corruption, which is often caused by memory corruption issues like use-after-free or out-of-bounds write.\n\nThe selection of CWE-366 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the **data race** condition within a thread. While CWE-362 is a broader class of race conditions, CWE-366 is more precise. CWE-416 and CWE-787 are included as secondary candidates because they represent potential consequences of the race condition leading to heap corruption.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-416: Use After Free\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product reuses or references memory after it has been freed.
