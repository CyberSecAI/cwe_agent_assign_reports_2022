CWE-79 is a more specific case of improper neutralization that leads to cross-site scripting, making it a better fit than its parent. The retriever results also suggest CWE-20, Improper Input Validation, which is a class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-79 but is too general for this case.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe74 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient input validation** (which could be mapped to CWE-20, but is implicit in CWE-79) leading to **cross-site scripting** (CWE-79), which then allows an attacker to execute arbitrary script code and access sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis indicates that CWE-79, Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'), is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability. This is supported by the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions \"cross-site scripting\" and states that the vulnerabilities are due to **insufficient input validation** of user-supplied input. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also identifies CWE-79 as a weakness.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-79 as a top candidate. While CWE-20, Improper Input Validation, is also listed, it is a more general class of weakness and the description points to a specific type of vulnerability: XSS. The provided evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-79 as the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF
