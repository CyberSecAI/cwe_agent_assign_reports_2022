## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-645 | Overly Restrictive Account Lockout Mechanism | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship impacting the decision is that CWE-645 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), indicating a more specific type of authentication failure. This hierarchical relationship reinforces the selection of CWE-645 as the most accurate representation of the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **Overly Restrictive Account Lockout Mechanism** (CWE-645). This leads to the impact of a denial-of-service condition, specifically the lockout of legitimate users.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis strongly pointed to CWE-645 as the primary weakness, and this was reinforced by the supporting evidence and relationship analysis. The vulnerability description clearly states that the **rootcause** is an **Overly Restrictive Account Lockout Mechanism**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions "Overly Restrictive Account Lockout Mechanism (CWE-645)". This direct reference confirms the initial assessment with high confidence. The relationship analysis further solidifies this choice, as CWE-645 is a specific type of improper authentication (CWE-287). The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly describes the mechanism causing the vulnerability.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Reason for not selecting*: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability is about an account lockout mechanism, not about releasing resources without clearing sensitive information.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Reason for not selecting*: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability is about an overly restrictive lockout mechanism, not about the strength of the credentials themselves.

## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is "asymmetric."

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Reason for not selecting*: While this vulnerability leads to a form of resource consumption (account lockout), CWE-645 is a more specific and accurate description of the underlying issue.

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Reason for not selecting*: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability is about an account lockout mechanism, not about improper resource release.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Reason for not selecting*: While the number of failed login attempts is an input, the core issue is the overly restrictive nature of the lockout, not the reliance on an untrusted input to bypass a protection mechanism.

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Reason for not selecting*: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability is about an account lockout mechanism, not about hard-coded credentials.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

*Reason for not selecting*: This CWE is too general and does not accurately describe the specific weakness.

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Reason for not selecting*: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability is about an account lockout mechanism, not about storing sensitive information in cleartext.

## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.

*Reason for not selecting*: This CWE is too general and does not accurately describe the specific weakness.

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.

*Reason for not selecting*: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability is about an account lockout mechanism, not about handling insufficient privileges.

## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 5895.93
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).
