It is a child of CWE-693.\nCWE-356 is a base-level weakness related to the product UI not warning the user of unsafe actions and is a child of CWE-221.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe757[\"CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    cwe356[\"CWE-356: Product UI does not Warn User of Unsafe Actions\"]\n    cwe221[\"CWE-221: Information Loss or Omission\"]\n\n    cwe757 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe356 -->|CHILDOF| cwe221\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe757 primary\n    class cwe356 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the `alpine` email client's **failure to maintain a secure connection** after a `/tls` command in specific circumstances with PREAUTH enabled, leading to a silent downgrade to an insecure connection. This can then enable man-in-the-middle attacks, resulting in the loss of confidentiality and integrity. The product UI does not warn the user of the insecure action taken.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the analysis focused on identifying the core weakness related to the **insecure connection**. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" highlighted the \"**insecure connection**\" as the primary weakness. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" indicated that the `alpine` client silently switched to an insecure connection, which aligns with CWE-757, \"Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')\". This CWE accurately represents the root cause, where the client **fails to select the strongest available algorithm** and instead opts for a less secure connection. The fact that the UI doesn't warn the user about this downgrade is also relevant, which is why CWE-356 \"Product UI does not Warn User of Unsafe Actions\" was also selected as a secondary CWE.\n\nThe relationship analysis showed that CWE-757 is a child of CWE-693, \"Protection Mechanism Failure\". Given the specific nature of the vulnerability (downgrading to a less secure algorithm), CWE-757 was deemed a more precise fit than its parent.\n\nThe retriever results listed CWE-757 as a top candidate based on dense analysis, which further validated the selection of this CWE.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description supports this classification. The CVE summary explicitly states the **silent downgrade** to an insecure connection.\n\nThe selection of CWE-757 and CWE-356 is at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause (**algorithm downgrade**) and the lack of user awareness (**no warning in UI**), respectively.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were
