This is a base-level CWE. CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) is a parent Class of CWE-379. CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is a high-level Class that can be a parent of CWE-732.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe379[\"CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe379 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe379 primary\n    class cwe732,cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with the **creation of a temporary file with insecure permissions** (CWE-379). This leads to a critical resource having **incorrect permission assignments** (CWE-732), which results in the **exposure of the resource to the wrong control sphere** (CWE-668). Finally, an unauthenticated attacker can leverage this to perform high-privileged actions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a vulnerability in Adobe Photoshop Elements related to insecure temporary file creation. The root cause is the **creation of a temporary file in a directory with incorrect permissions**, which aligns perfectly with CWE-379 (Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions). The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" explicitly mentions that the **root cause** is the \"Creation of a temporary file in a directory with incorrect permissions\" and also identifies a \"CWE-379 violation\".\n\nThe \"Retriever Results\" also lists CWE-379 as the top match.\n\nCWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) is considered as a secondary CWE because the temporary file itself can be considered a critical resource.\n\nCWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is also considered as a secondary CWE, but it is a high-level class and less specific than CWE-379 and CWE-732.\n\nThe selection of CWE-379 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** described in the vulnerability details: \"Creation of a temporary file in a directory with incorrect permissions\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.83\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
