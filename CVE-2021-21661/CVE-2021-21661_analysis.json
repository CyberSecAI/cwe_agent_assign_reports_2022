Although it's a Class-level CWE, its description closely aligns with the vulnerability. CWE-497 was considered because the enumeration of credential IDs is akin to exposing sensitive system information but was chosen as a secondary because the primary issue is the **missing authorization**. The choice of CWE-862 is further supported by its connection to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), indicating a failure in the authorization process, although CWE-862 is more specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe497 secondary\n    class cwe285 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission checks** (CWE-862), which allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credential IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. This enumeration can then lead to further exploitation to capture the credentials.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The key phrase \"**does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints**\" strongly suggests a **missing authorization** issue. The content summary reinforces this by explicitly mentioning the \"**Missing Permission Checks**\" as a weakness.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the class level because the provided information does not offer enough detail to pinpoint a more specific authorization flaw. The Retriever Results also list CWE-862 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-497 was also considered because the impact of the vulnerability leads to exposure of credential IDs, which is related to sensitive system information. However, the root cause is more directly tied to the authorization **missing**.\n\nThe final decision favors CWE-862 as the primary CWE due to its direct alignment with the stated root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-497 serves as a secondary CWE to highlight the resulting exposure of sensitive information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
