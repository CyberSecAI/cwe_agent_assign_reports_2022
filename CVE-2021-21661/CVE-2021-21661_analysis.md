# Analysis for CVE-2021-21661

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-497 | Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the choice of CWE-862 was its direct relevance to the **missing permission checks**. Although it's a Class-level CWE, its description closely aligns with the vulnerability. CWE-497 was considered because the enumeration of credential IDs is akin to exposing sensitive system information but was chosen as a secondary because the primary issue is the **missing authorization**. The choice of CWE-862 is further supported by its connection to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), indicating a failure in the authorization process, although CWE-862 is more specific.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission checks** (CWE-862), which allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credential IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. This enumeration can then lead to further exploitation to capture the credentials.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The key phrase "**does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints**" strongly suggests a **missing authorization** issue. The content summary reinforces this by explicitly mentioning the "**Missing Permission Checks**" as a weakness.

The selection of CWE-862 is at the class level because the provided information does not offer enough detail to pinpoint a more specific authorization flaw. The Retriever Results also list CWE-862 as the top candidate.

CWE-497 was also considered because the impact of the vulnerability leads to exposure of credential IDs, which is related to sensitive system information. However, the root cause is more directly tied to the authorization **missing**.

The final decision favors CWE-862 as the primary CWE due to its direct alignment with the stated root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-497 serves as a secondary CWE to highlight the resulting exposure of sensitive information.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.
