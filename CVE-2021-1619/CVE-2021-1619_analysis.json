It is related to parent classes CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource) and CWE-665 (Improper Control of Resource Management). The vulnerability can then lead to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) as secondary weaknesses, which are class-level CWEs and represent the impact of the uninitialized variable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe457[\"CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable\"]\n    cwe908[\"CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\"]\n    cwe665[\"CWE-665: Improper Control of Resource Management\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe457 -->|CHILDOF| cwe908\n    cwe457 -->|CHILDOF| cwe665\n    cwe285 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe457\n    cwe400 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe457\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe457 primary\n    class cwe908,cwe665,cwe285,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **uninitialized variable** (CWE-457) that leads to bypass of authentication (CWE-285) or memory corruption and DoS (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the evidence of \"**uninitialized variable**\" as the **root cause** of the vulnerability in the provided description. The description clearly states that the vulnerability is due to an **uninitialized variable** in the AAA function of Cisco IOS XE Software. This leads to bypassing authentication and causing memory corruption and DoS.\n\nThe graph relationships show that the **root cause** CWE-457 can directly lead to CWE-285 and CWE-400.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-457 directly addresses the **root cause** (the **uninitialized variable**), and CWE-285 and CWE-400 describe the immediate impacts of this weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-606: Unchecked Input for Loop Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive -
