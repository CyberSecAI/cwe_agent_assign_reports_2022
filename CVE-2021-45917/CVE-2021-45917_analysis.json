CWE-287 is a Class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-306 and CWE-295. While **improper authentication** is mentioned as a root cause, the SSRF attack vector is a more specific manifestation of this **improper authentication**. CWE-918 is also related to CWE-441 (Unintended Proxy or Intermediary), suggesting a potential misdirection of requests.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe441[\"CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('Confused Deputy')\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe295[\"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe918 -->|CHILDOF| cwe441\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe295 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe918 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n    class cwe441,cwe306,cwe295 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper authentication** (CWE-287), which leads to the possibility of launching a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack (CWE-918). The SSRF then results in arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided description of the vulnerability, which states that an authenticated attacker can launch a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack due to **improper authentication**.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack,\" making CWE-918 the most directly relevant CWE. The **root cause** is **improper authentication**, but the attack manifests as an SSRF, which leads to arbitrary code execution. Therefore, CWE-918 is the primary weakness, and CWE-287 is a contributing factor.\n\nCWE-918 is at the Base level of abstraction and directly addresses the SSRF attack vector, while CWE-287 is a more general Class-level weakness. Because the description specifically mentions SSRF, using CWE-918 provides a more precise and actionable classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.83\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product acts as an intermediary HTTP agent\n         (such as a proxy or firewall) in the data flow between two\n         entities such as a client and server, but it does not\n         interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that\n         are consistent with how the messages will be processed by\n         those entities that are at the ultimate destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
