CWE-614 is a variant that specifies the use of a sensitive cookie in an HTTPS session without the 'Secure' attribute. This is an important refinement to the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n    cwe312 -->|PEEROF| cwe319\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe614 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **cleartext transmission** and storage of credentials via cookies. This leads to the potential interception of these credentials, and ultimately, unauthorized access to the router's settings.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** (CWE-312).\n  - **Weakness:** Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute (CWE-614).\n  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to router settings.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed towards both CWE-312 and CWE-614. The final decision is to include both as the primary and secondary CWEs, respectively.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the username is sent in **cleartext** via cookies. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-312 which is about storing sensitive information in **cleartext**.\n\nAdditionally, the use of cookies for transmitting credentials without the 'Secure' attribute exposes them to interception, matching CWE-614.\n\nThe selection of these CWEs is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
