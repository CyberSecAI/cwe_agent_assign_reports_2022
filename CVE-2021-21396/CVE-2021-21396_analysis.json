It has a parent CWE, CWE-200 (Information Exposure), which is a class-level CWE. It also has peer relationships with CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) and CWE-202 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries).\n\nCWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, is a Class level CWE. It is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    cwe202[\"CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe201 -- CANALSOBE --> cwe202\n    cwe201 -- CANALSOBE --> cwe209\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe202,cwe209,cwe863,cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect exposure of the `/users/list-clients` endpoint**, which then results in the **disclosure of sensitive user metadata**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-201 as the primary weakness, given the explicit **exposure of sensitive information** via the `/users/list-clients` endpoint. The vulnerability description and CVE details directly support this.\n\nCWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, is considered as a secondary candidate because any logged in user could access the details of any other user, without requiring any prior connection or authorization. The system **fails to correctly authorize** who can access the endpoint.\n\nThe selection of CWE-201 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the **root cause** (insertion of sensitive information) and is a base-level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
