CWE-312, a Base-level weakness, specifies a common way that credentials can be insufficiently protected, namely, storing them in cleartext. CWE-522 is a child of CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication), CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere).\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe922[\"CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe922\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe522 primary\n    class cwe312 secondary\n    class cwe1390,cwe287,cwe668,cwe311,cwe922 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **insufficiently protected credentials**, which leads to an attacker gaining access to database credentials. This access allows the attacker to shut down the product, access or alter data.\n  - The root cause is **Insufficiently Protected Credentials**.\n  - The impact is access to database credentials, the ability to shut down the product, and the ability to access or alter data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **Insufficiently Protected Credentials** as the primary weakness, which aligns with the vulnerability description and the CVE reference. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Insufficiently Protected Credentials** vulnerability\". The CVE reference link confirms this, stating: \"Root cause of vulnerability: Insufficiently Protected Credentials. The application stores database credentials in a way that is accessible to an attacker who has gained access to an authorized user's computer\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Credentials for the database are not sufficiently protected.\"\n\nCWE-522 is the primary candidate and the best fit, as it directly addresses the **insufficient protection of credentials**. However, it is a Class-level CWE, and the mapping guidance suggests examining children for a better fit.\n\nCWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is a potential secondary CWE, as it's a common method of **insufficiently protecting credentials**. The CVE description doesn't explicitly mention cleartext storage, but the description \"The application stores database credentials in a way that is accessible to an attacker\" implies that the credentials might be stored in a way that's easily readable, such as cleartext.\n\nTherefore, CWE-522 is the primary CWE, representing the core weakness, and CWE-312 is a secondary CWE that describes a likely method of **insufficient protection**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-522 and CWE-312 is at the optimal level of specificity, given the provided information. While it is possible that other more specific weaknesses could be present, such as weak encryption, the current evidence does not support those classifications.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30018:** A messaging platform serializes all elements of User/Group objects, making private information available to adversaries\n- **CVE-2022-29959:** Initialization file contains credentials that can be decoded using a \"simple string transformation\"\n- **CVE-2022-35411:** Python-based RPC framework enables pickle functionality by default, allowing clients to unpickle untrusted data.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n### Extended Description\nBecause the information is stored in cleartext (i.e., unencrypted), attackers could potentially read it.

However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.\n- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie\n- **CVE-2009-1466:** password stored in cleartext in a file with insecure permissions",
