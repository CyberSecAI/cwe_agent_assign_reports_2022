CWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs) is a base CWE. The vulnerability description and CVE reference link content summary clearly indicate that the root cause is an **incomplete protection mechanism**, where backticks were not blocked, leading to command injection.\n\nCWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command) and CWE-95 (Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code) are related because the **incomplete list of disallowed inputs** allows for OS command injection or Eval injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe95[\"CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe184\n    cwe95 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe184\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe184 primary\n    class cwe78,cwe95 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incomplete protection mechanism** (CWE-184), which allows for the injection of shell commands via backticks (``), leading to remote PHP code execution.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-184 (**incomplete protection mechanism**)\n  - **Weakness:** Injection of shell commands\n  - **Impact:** Remote PHP code execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **incomplete protection mechanism** in Dolibarr's website builder module. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary strongly supports this: \"The website builder module in Dolibarr 13.0.2 allows remote PHP code execution because of an **incomplete protection mechanism** in which system, exec, and shell_exec are blocked but backticks are not blocked.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms that the application's attempt to block specific dangerous functions is circumvented by the use of backticks.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the potential chain of events: an **incomplete list** allows for command or code injection.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-184, is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause**, which is the **incomplete list of disallowed inputs**. While CWE-78 and CWE-95 are potential consequences of this weakness, CWE-184 represents the fundamental flaw that enables the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n*Not Selected*: While input validation is related, the core issue is that there is an incomplete list of what is disallowed.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n*Not Selected*: Data authenticity isn't the issue.
