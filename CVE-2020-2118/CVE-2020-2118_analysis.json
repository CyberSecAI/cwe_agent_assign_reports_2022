Since the description specifically mentions a **missing permission check**, CWE-862 is more appropriate than its parent. The relationship between CWE-200 (Information Exposure) and CWE-538 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory) was also considered.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe538 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe538 secondary\n    class cwe668,cwe201 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which leads to the exposure of credential IDs. This can be seen as an instance of information exposure. This leads to a potential impact where these exposed credential IDs can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to capture the actual credentials themselves.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **missing permission check**. The vulnerability description, particularly the key phrases and CVE reference, explicitly states this.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is based on the following evidence:\n\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** \"**missing permission check**\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"The plugin does not implement adequate permission checks when listing available credential IDs.\"\n\nThis directly aligns with the description of CWE-862: \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\"\n\nCWE-862 is at the Class level of abstraction. While it is generally preferred to map to Base or Variant levels, in this case, there isn't a more specific CWE that accurately captures the nature of the **missing authorization**. The vulnerability doesn't involve incorrect authorization (CWE-863), but rather the complete absence of an authorization check.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-538: Considered as a secondary weakness, as the exposure of credential IDs is a form of sensitive information being placed in an accessible location. However, the primary issue is the **missing authorization check** that leads to this exposure.\n*   CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere was considered since the credential IDs are being exposed to users with Overall/Read access, which is the wrong sphere. However, this CWE is discouraged and a more specific CWE, CWE-862, is more appropriate.\n*   CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data was considered. The exposure of credential IDs can be seen as insertion of sensitive information. However, the more direct cause is still the **missing authorization**.\n\nThe final decision is to map the vulnerability to CWE-862 as the primary weakness, with CWE-538, CWE-668, and CWE-201 as secondary candidates. CWE-862 directly addresses the **missing permission check**, which is the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community.
