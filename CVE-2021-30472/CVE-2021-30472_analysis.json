This hierarchical relationship indicates that CWE-121 is a specific type of out-of-bounds write that occurs on the stack. CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) can precede CWE-121 if an incorrect size calculation leads to the buffer overflow.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe131 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe121\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe131 secondary\n    class cwe787,cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a potential **incorrect calculation of the buffer size** (CWE-131) which leads to a **stack-based buffer overflow** (CWE-121) when data exceeding the calculated size is written to the buffer.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The key phrase \"**stack-based buffer overflow**\" directly points to CWE-121. The root cause, \"**improper check of the keyLength value**,\" suggests that the size of the key is not properly validated before being used, which could lead to an **incorrect calculation of the buffer size** (CWE-131) before copying it to the stack.\n\nThe retriever results also support CWE-121 as a strong candidate. CWE-119 is discouraged, and its child CWE-121 is a better match. CWE-190 doesn't fit because there is no integer overflow mentioned.\n\nThe selection of CWE-121 is at the optimal level of specificity as it is a Variant that accurately describes the **stack-based buffer overflow**. CWE-131 is added because the root cause mentions an **improper check of the keyLength value**, which could result in an **incorrect calculation of buffer size**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nStack Overflow: \"Stack Overflow\" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-788\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Stack-based buffer overflows can instantiate in return address overwrites, stack pointer overwrites or frame pointer overwrites. They can also be considered function pointer overwrites, array indexer overwrites or write-what-where condition, etc.\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-35395:** Stack-based buffer overflows in SFK for wifi chipset used for IoT/embedded devices, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.",
