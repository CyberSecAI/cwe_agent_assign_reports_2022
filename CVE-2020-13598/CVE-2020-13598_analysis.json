CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input) can precede CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe123\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe120,cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **lack of input validation**, leading to a **buffer overflow** when `fs_stat` is called with a filename exceeding `MAX_FILE_NAME` when LFN is enabled. This leads to **memory corruption** and potential **program termination**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment correctly identifies **CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow** as a strong candidate. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary strongly supports this. The summary clearly indicates a buffer overflow on the stack when `fs_stat` is called with a long filename.\n\nThe analysis is based on the following evidence:\n- Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \" **weakness:** **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121)**\"\n- CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"A buffer overflow occurs when the `fs_stat` function is called on a file with a filename longer than 12 characters, when Long File Names (LFN) support is enabled in the FAT file system implementation.\"\n- CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The `fatfs_stat` function in `subsys/fs/fat_fs.c` uses a fixed-size buffer (`MAX_FILE_NAME`) to store the file name, without checking if the provided name exceeds this limit, leading to a buffer overflow.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by clarifying the hierarchical structure. CWE-121 is a specific type of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), which in turn is a type of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). Since the overflow occurs on the stack, CWE-121 is more specific and appropriate than its parents.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because the description explicitly states that it is a stack-based buffer overflow.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* Although incorrect buffer size calculation could lead to a buffer overflow, the primary issue here is the lack of input validation and subsequent overflow, not a calculation error.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* Integer underflow is not indicated in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* While an incorrect length could be involved, the core issue is the lack of checking the length of the filename before copying it into the fixed-size buffer.\n\n## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* Not the primary cause;
