I considered more specific CWEs, especially children of CWE-200, but the description lacks the details needed to select them confidently. Both selected CWEs are discouraged, indicating a need for more granularity if available.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **lack of proper access control** for OSDP key material, leading to the **exposure of sensitive information** to unauthorized Command Centre operators. The chain is:\n\n1.  **Improper Access Control** (Implicit, not explicitly stated, but the root cause)\n2.  **CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\" vulnerability. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" indicates that the **weakness** is the \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\". The vulnerability description explicitly states \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Gallagher Command Centre Server allows OSDP key material to be exposed to Command Centre Operators.\"\n\nSeveral CWEs were considered from the Retriever Results, including CWE-316, CWE-1023, CWE-213, and others. However, none of them precisely matched the provided evidence. CWE-200 was selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the described **impact**: the exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor.\n\nAlthough CWE-200 is discouraged due to its high-level nature and frequent misuse, the provided vulnerability description lacks the necessary details to pinpoint a more specific root cause. For example, it doesn't explicitly mention **incorrect authorization**, **improper input validation**, or any other specific coding error that led to the information exposure. The description only states that OSDP key material is exposed to Command Centre Operators.\n\nCWE-668 was selected as a secondary CWE because it represents a broader class of vulnerabilities related to exposing resources to the wrong control sphere. It's a parent of CWE-200, further emphasizing the high-level nature of the identified weakness.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 and CWE-668 is based on the evidence available in the vulnerability description and the Retriever Results. Without more specific details about the underlying coding error, it's challenging to map the vulnerability to a more precise CWE. The confidence level is moderate due to the lack of granular details.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
