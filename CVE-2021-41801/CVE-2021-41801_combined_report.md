## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing my decision is that CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a class-level CWE that can have more specific Base-level children. While several children were considered, none precisely captured the specific flaw where a queued job continues to run even after a user's authorization has been revoked. CWE-613 (Insufficient Session Expiration) was considered because it addresses the concept of sessions remaining active longer than intended, but it doesn't directly address the authorization failure occurring with queued jobs.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events in this vulnerability is as follows:
1.  User with appropriate privileges submits a job.
2.  User's privileges are revoked (e.g., blocked).
3.  The job is executed without re-checking authorization.
    *   Root Cause: **Incorrect Access Control** (CWE-863) due to **missing authorization check**
    *   Impact: Unauthorized actions are performed after privilege revocation.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, the vulnerability description points towards **incorrect access control**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating that the root cause is that the `ReplaceText` MediaWiki extension was **not properly checking user permissions** before executing text replacement jobs. The summary explicitly mentions a **missing authorization check** in the `ReplaceTextJob` class to ensure that the user still possessed the `replacetext` permission right at the time of job execution. This leads me to select CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), which describes a scenario where an authorization check is performed, but it is done incorrectly.

CWE-613 (Insufficient Session Expiration) was considered because the job continued to run even after the user's permissions were revoked, suggesting that the session or authorization was not properly terminated. However, the core issue is the **lack of a check at the time of execution**, which is more directly related to authorization than session management.

The evidence strongly supports CWE-863 as the primary weakness. The retriever results also list CWE-863 as the top combined result.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-41801

## Vulnerability Description
The ReplaceText extension through 1.41 for MediaWiki has Incorrect Access Control. When a user is blocked after submitting a replace job, the job is still run, even if it may be run at a later time (due to the job queue backlog)

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **incorrect access control**
- **impact:** blocked job is still run
- **attacker:** user
- **product:** ReplaceText extension
- **version:** through 1.41

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41801:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `ReplaceText` MediaWiki extension was not properly checking user permissions before executing text replacement jobs. This allowed a user who had their permissions revoked (e.g., by being blocked) to continue performing text replacement actions that they were no longer authorized to perform.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The `ReplaceTextJob` class lacked a check to ensure that the user still possessed the `replacetext` permission right at the time of job execution. It relied on the initial permission check at the time the job was created/queued, which could become invalid if user permissions changed after the job was queued and before it ran.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** A blocked user or a user who had their permissions revoked could continue to modify pages using the `ReplaceText` extension, potentially causing vandalism or other unwanted changes even after administrative intervention.
*   **Circumvention of Administrative Controls:** Blocking a user or removing permissions would not immediately prevent them from performing text replacements if jobs were already queued.

**Attack vectors:**
*   An attacker would need to use the `ReplaceText` extension to queue jobs, then get their permissions revoked by being blocked, or have their user rights removed. Jobs submitted before permissions revocation would still execute.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs a user account that initially has the `replacetext` permission right.
*   The attacker needs to be able to submit text replacement jobs through the `ReplaceText` special page or an API.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability was addressed by adding a permission check within the `ReplaceTextJob::run` method. This check uses `PermissionManager->userCan` to verify that the user still has the necessary `replacetext` right.
*   The fix ensures that if the user no longer has permission (due to being blocked or rights revocation), the job will not proceed. It uses the correct `userCan` method to properly detect a blocked user.
*   The fix involved modifying the return value of the function to prevent the job from being retried when it fails due to permission issues.
*   The fix was backported to multiple branches of the MediaWiki software: REL1_31, REL1_35, REL1_36, REL1_37 and master.
*  A bug was found in the initial fix for MediaWiki 1.35 which was missing a `use` statement and was fixed.
* The patch would only stop users who were blocked between the job being submitted, and the job being run.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

### Extended Description
This weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.

### Alternative Terms
TOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to "Time Of Check To Time Of Use".
TOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.

**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed
- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.
- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.

## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.

- **CVE-2002-1977:** Product does not "time out" according to user specification, leaving sensitive data available after it has expired.




## CWE-609: Double-Checked Locking
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses double-checked locking to access a resource without the overhead of explicit synchronization, but the locking is insufficient.

### Extended Description
Double-checked locking refers to the situation where a programmer checks to see if a resource has been initialized, grabs a lock, checks again to see if the resource has been initialized, and then performs the initialization if it has not occurred yet. This should not be done, as it is not guaranteed to work in all languages and on all architectures. In summary, other threads may not be operating inside the synchronous block and are not guaranteed to see the operations execute in the same order as they would appear inside the synchronous block.

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

### Extended Description

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.
