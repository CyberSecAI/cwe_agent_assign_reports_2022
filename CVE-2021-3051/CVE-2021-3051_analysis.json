It is a child of CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity), which is a more general class. CWE-285 is a Class level weakness, and is related to authorization issues which are a potential consequence of the cryptographic signature failure, but not the core **root cause**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe345,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper verification of the cryptographic signature** (CWE-347), which leads to the ability to bypass authentication and potentially perform unauthorized actions.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\n  - **Impact:** Access protected resources and perform unauthorized actions\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis and criticism focused on identifying the most accurate CWE to represent the **root cause** of the vulnerability.

The retriever results also list CWE-347 as the top candidate.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but ultimately deemed less suitable:\n- CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was considered because the vulnerability allows an attacker to perform unauthorized actions. However, this is a consequence of the **improper signature verification**, not the **root cause** itself.\n- CWE-303 (Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm) was also considered, but the core issue is not an incorrect implementation of the entire authentication algorithm, but rather a failure in verifying the cryptographic signature.\n\nThe selection of CWE-347 is at the optimal level of specificity because it is a Base-level CWE that accurately represents the identified weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5269.27\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Similarity Score**: 5067.18\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead.
