CWE-425 (Direct Request) is related to CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and can precede CWE-471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data). CWE-289 (Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name) is related to CWE-1390 (Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard). The choice of CWE-647 as primary reflects the specific mechanism of bypassing authorization via non-canonical URL paths.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe647[\"CWE-647: Use of Non-Canonical URL Paths for Authorization Decisions\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe471[\"CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\"]\n    cwe289[\"CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard\"]\n\n    cwe647 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe425 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe471\n    cwe289 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe647 primary\n    class cwe425,cwe289 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of URL paths** (CWE-647) leading to the **bypass of access controls**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **bypass of /wp-json access control via a trailing ? character**, which pointed towards issues in URL handling and authorization. The primary CWE selected is CWE-647 (Use of Non-Canonical URL Paths for Authorization Decisions). This is supported by the vulnerability description which states the bypass is achieved through a **trailing ? character**, making the URL non-canonical.\n\nThe selection of CWE-647 is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description, \"**bypass of /wp-json access control via a trailing ? character**\". This explicitly shows that the **trailing ? character** leads to a non-canonical URL which bypasses the access control.\n\nCWE-425 (Direct Request) was considered because the bypass of access control could be viewed as directly requesting a resource without proper authorization. However, the specific mechanism of using a non-canonical URL makes CWE-647 a more precise fit. CWE-289 (Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name) was also considered as the **trailing ? character** can be seen as an alternate name for the resource, but again CWE-647 is more specific to URL path handling.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability which is the use of non-canonical URLs in authorization decisions.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression that does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
