The \"**memory corruption**\" could lead to an out-of-bounds write, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite critical data and escalate privileges.\n\nThe graph relationships show how CWE-415 can be related to other memory management issues like CWE-416 (Use After Free) and CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition), but given the direct mention of \"**double free**,\" CWE-415 remains the most specific and relevant primary CWE.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-415 is a Variant that directly matches the described root cause, and CWE-787 is a Base that describes a potential consequence of the **memory corruption**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\nThe following CWEs were considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource - While possible, the description focuses on a double free, not the use of uninitialized resources.\n*   CWE-667: Improper Locking & CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') - Neither locking issues nor race conditions are explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition - While this could be a consequence of the **memory corruption**, it is not as directly related as CWE-787.\n* CWE-416: Use After Free - While a double free can sometimes resemble a use-after-free, the description explicitly mentions the double free as the root cause, making CWE-415 more appropriate.",
