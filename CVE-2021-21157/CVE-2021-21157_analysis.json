It is related to CWE-825 [Expired Pointer Dereference], of which it is a child. The CWE-416 can precede CWE-120 [Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')] and CWE-123 [Write-what-where Condition], indicating potential exploit chains.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe120\n    cwe416 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe123\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe825,cwe120,cwe123 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **use after free** (CWE-416), which leads to heap corruption. The attacker can then exploit this heap corruption via a crafted HTML page, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-416 [Use After Free]. This is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, both of which explicitly state that the root cause of the vulnerability is a **use after free**.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"**Use after free** in Web Sockets in Google Chrome on Linux prior to 88.0.4324.182 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary states:\n```\n{\n  \"CVE-2021-21157\": {\n    \"root_cause\": \"Use after free\",\n    \"vulnerabilities\": [\n      \"Use after free\"\n    ],\n    \"impact\": \"Arbitrary code execution\",\n     \"attack_vectors\": [\n      \"WebSockets\"\n    ],\n    \"attacker_capabilities\": \"An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious content and convincing a user to open it.\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCWE-416 [Use After Free] is a Variant level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities. The usage is \"Allowed\" per MITRE mapping guidance. The description of CWE-416 accurately reflects the vulnerability, as it involves reusing or referencing memory after it has been freed.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-366 [Race Condition within a Thread], CWE-362 [Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')], and CWE-364 [Signal Handler Race Condition] were considered but not selected because the vulnerability description does not explicitly mention a race condition. The **use after free** itself is the primary issue, and a race condition isn't necessarily a prerequisite.\n*   CWE-122 [Heap-based Buffer Overflow] was considered since the vulnerability allows a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption. However, the root cause is **use after free** which can lead to heap corruption.\n*   CWE-843 [Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')] was not selected as the description doesn't indicate type confusion.\n*   CWE-1385 [Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets] was not selected because the description focuses on the **use after free** in web sockets, and not on the missing origin validation.\n*   CWE-415 [Double Free] was not selected as the root cause is **use after free**.\n*   CWE-911 [Improper Update of Reference Count] was not selected as the description doesn't indicate a reference count issue.\n*   CWE-451 [User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information] was not selected as the description doesn't indicate a UI issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:",
