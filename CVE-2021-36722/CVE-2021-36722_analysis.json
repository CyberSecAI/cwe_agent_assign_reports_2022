The secondary weakness, **CWE-209 Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information**, aids the attacker by revealing parts of the code and the webroot location. CWE-209 is a child of CWE-200. The **SQL injection** can lead to full RCE and bypassing login authentication and dumping the whole database.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe209 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe89 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe209\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe209 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **SQL Injection** (CWE-89), which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This leads to **CWE-209 Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information**, where the application reveals sensitive information in error messages, aiding the attacker in further exploitation. This chain results in full RCE, bypassing login authentication, and database dumping.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **SQL injection** vulnerability and the subsequent exposure of sensitive information. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**SQL injection** can be used in various ways ranging from bypassing login authentication or dumping the whole database to full RCE on the affected endpoints.\" This statement strongly supports the selection of CWE-89 as the primary weakness. The description further states, \"The SQLi caused by **CWE-209 Generation of Error Message Containig Sensetive Information**, showing parts of the aspx code and the webroot location , information an attacker can leverage to further compromise the host.\" This indicates that CWE-209 is a secondary issue that facilitates further exploitation.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-89 is the primary root cause, while CWE-209 is a secondary issue that is enabled by the **SQL injection**. The selection of CWE-89 and CWE-209 is at the optimal level of specificity, as they directly represent the root cause and contributing factor to the vulnerability, respectively.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
