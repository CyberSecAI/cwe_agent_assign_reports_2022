The relationship between CWE-362 and CWE-416 is that CWE-362 can precede CWE-416. CWE-416 is a variant, making it more specific than higher-level classifications and is a child of CWE-825 and CWE-672. CWE-362 is a class and might have base-level children.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration or Release\"]\n\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe362 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe362 secondary\n    class cwe825,cwe672 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition (CWE-362)** that leads to a **use-after-free (CWE-416)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that a **race condition** leads to a **use-after-free**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating \"Race condition during the handling of a ReadableStream leading to a use-after-free.\" This provides strong evidence for mapping both CWE-362 and CWE-416.\n\nCWE-416 is chosen as the primary CWE because the vulnerability is ultimately a **use-after-free**. CWE-362 is a contributing factor as it causes the **use-after-free**.\n\nThe retriever results list both CWE-362 and CWE-416 with high scores and relevance, supporting the selection of these CWEs.\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) was considered but not selected. While a **use-after-free** can lead to memory corruption, the description does not explicitly mention an out-of-bounds write.\nCWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) was considered because it is a type of **race condition**, but it is not applicable here because the **race condition** doesn't involve checking the state of a resource before using it. The general **race condition (CWE-362)** is a more accurate description of the vulnerability.\nCWE-427 (Uncontrolled Search Path Element) was considered but is not relevant to this vulnerability.\nCWE-366 (Race Condition within a Thread) was considered, but the description doesn't specify that the **race condition** is within a thread, so CWE-362 is more appropriate.\nCWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition) was considered because **use-after-free** can result in arbitrary writes, however the description does not directly mention this condition.\nCWE-415 (Double Free) was considered, but the description doesn't mention a double free.\nCWE-667 (Improper Locking) was considered because it can lead to **race conditions**, but there's no mention of locking mechanisms in the description.\nCWE-662 (Improper Synchronization) was considered, but it's a higher-level class and there's no specific information about synchronization mechanisms in the description.\n\nThe selection of CWE-416 and CWE-362 is based on the provided evidence, and their hierarchical relationship is well-defined. The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n- CWE-416: Use After Free",
