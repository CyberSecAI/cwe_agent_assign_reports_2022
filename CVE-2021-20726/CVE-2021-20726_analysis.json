It is related to CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) through a ChildOf relationship, indicating that CWE-427 is a specific type of resource exposure. CWE-426 (Untrusted Search Path) is a peer of CWE-427, representing a similar but distinct weakness where the search path itself is untrusted, rather than an element within a controlled path.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe427[\"CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe426[\"CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path\"]\n    \n    cwe427 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe427 --|PEEROF| cwe426\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe427 primary\n    class cwe668,cwe426 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **untrusted search path** (**rootcause**), leading to the loading of a Trojan horse DLL. This allows an attacker to **gain privileges and execute arbitrary code** (**impact**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to CWE-427 (Uncontrolled Search Path Element) as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an **untrusted search path**, which aligns directly with the definition of CWE-427, where \"The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.\" This is supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which identifies the \"Overwolf installer has a DLL search path issue (CWE-427).\" The **rootcause** is the Overwolf installer's failure to properly control the DLL search path, enabling the loading of malicious DLLs.\n\nCWE-426 (Untrusted Search Path) was also considered but deemed less accurate. While related, CWE-426 describes situations where the entire search path is untrusted, whereas the Overwolf case involves a controlled path with an uncontrolled element (the current working directory).\n\nThe selection of CWE-427 is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the supporting CVE Reference Links Content Summary, as well as the mapping guidance which allows the use of Base level CWEs. This provides a high level of confidence in the assessment.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
