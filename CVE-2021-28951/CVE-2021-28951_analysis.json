The vulnerability description explicitly states that the issue is a **deadlock**. |\n| CWE-362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE. The **deadlock** occurs due to concurrent access to a shared resource without proper synchronization. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-833 (Deadlock), which is a child of CWE-667 (Improper Locking) and CWE-662 (Improper Synchronization). The vulnerability arises from concurrent execution, making CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) a relevant secondary consideration. The deadlock is a specific type of concurrency issue where threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe833[\"CWE-833: Deadlock\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe662[\"CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n\n    cwe833 -->|CHILDOF| cwe667\n    cwe833 -->|CHILDOF| cwe662\n    cwe362 -->|PEEROF| cwe662\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe833 primary\n    class cwe362 secondary\n    class cwe667,cwe662 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the Linux kernel failing to properly manage the state of the `SQPOLL` thread. The **root cause** is the **deadlock** when exiting the program.\n  - Initial Flaw: **Improper** state management of `SQPOLL` thread.\n  - Weakness: **Deadlock** between the exiting process and the `SQPOLL` thread.\n  - Impact: Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-833 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of \"**deadlock**\" in the vulnerability description. The reference link content summary reinforces this by stating, \"**Deadlock:** The primary weakness is a deadlock between the main process exiting and the `SQPOLL` thread. The exiting process waits for the `SQPOLL` thread to park, but the `SQPOLL` thread is waiting to receive a signal to start.\"\n\nCWE-362 was considered as a secondary weakness because the **deadlock** arises from concurrent execution issues. The `SQPOLL` thread and the exiting process are both trying to access shared resources, and the lack of proper synchronization leads to the **deadlock** condition.\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-833 is a child of CWE-667 and CWE-662, indicating that **deadlocks** are a specific type of improper locking and synchronization issue. CWE-362 is a peer of CWE-662, further emphasizing the connection between concurrency and synchronization problems.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-833 is a Base-level CWE that directly describes the **deadlock** condition. CWE-362 is a Class-level CWE that provides additional context about the concurrent execution aspects of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
