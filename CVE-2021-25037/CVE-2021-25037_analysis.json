This directly addresses the **SQL injection** vulnerability. |\n| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. Although the vulnerability is triggered by an authenticated user, it highlights a broader authentication issue. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship is that CWE-89 is a specific type of **injection** vulnerability, while CWE-287 represents a broader class of **authentication** issues that might contribute to the exploitability or impact of the **SQL injection**. The vulnerability requires authentication, which is why CWE-287 is a relevant consideration.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|ChildOf| cwe74\n    cwe287 -->|ParentOf| cwe1390\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n    class cwe74,cwe1390 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  An authenticated user makes a request with a crafted **SQL injection** payload.\n2.  The application **fails to properly sanitize** the input.\n3.  The database executes the malicious SQL code.\n4.  The attacker gains access to privileged information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-89, as the core issue is the improper neutralization of special elements in an SQL command. The vulnerability description clearly states the presence of an **SQL injection** issue, discovered during an internal audit, and could grant attackers access to privileged information. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary section confirms that the root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input. The use of `esc_like` is not suitable for database queries and should be used within `LIKE` clauses, thus allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-89, which states that the product constructs an SQL command using externally-influenced input but does not neutralize special elements that could modify the intended SQL command.\n\nCWE-287 was considered as a secondary weakness due to the requirement of an authenticated user. Although the **SQL injection** vulnerability is triggered by an authenticated user, it highlights a broader authentication issue. However, CWE-89 is the more direct and specific cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE was not selected because the core issue is not about the reliance on untrusted inputs in a security decision, but rather the improper sanitization of inputs leading to **SQL injection**.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE was not selected because the vulnerability doesn't involve bypassing authorization through user-controlled keys, but rather the **SQL injection** is the primary issue.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE was not selected because the core of the vulnerability is the **SQL injection** due to improper input sanitization, rather than the external control of assumed immutable parameters.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\nWhile CWE-74 is a broader category that includes **SQL injection**, CWE-89 is a more specific and appropriate match for the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis was considered but not chosen as primary because while the attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability, the actual flaw lies in the **SQL injection**, not a fundamentally **weak authentication** mechanism.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE does not fit the vulnerability because the issue is not about insufficient granularity of access control, but rather the **SQL injection** caused by improper sanitization.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis was not selected because the core issue is not the validation of unsafe equivalence in input, but the improper handling and sanitization of input leading to **SQL injection**.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE does not apply because the vulnerability does not involve path equivalence issues.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE is too broad and does not directly address the **SQL injection** vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\nThis CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability does not involve the improper handling of insufficient privileges.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6727.93\n**Source**: sparse\n\nThis CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is an **SQL injection**, not a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 6359.85\n**Source**: sparse\n\nThis CWE is related to encoding issues, but the core of the vulnerability is the **SQL injection** resulting from improper sanitization.\n\n## CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6219.20\n**Source**: sparse\n\nCase sensitivity is not the issue in this vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 6218.01\n**Source**: sparse\n\nThis vulnerability is not related to cross-site request forgery (CSRF).\n\n## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6208.91\n**Source**: sparse\n\nThis CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability does not involve deserialization of untrusted data.\n\n## CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\n\nThis vulnerability does not involve downloading code without integrity checks.\n\n## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\n\nSession expiration is not relevant to this **SQL injection** vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 3.64\n**Source**: graph\n\nThe vulnerability does not involve the modification of dynamically-determined object attributes.\n\n## CWE-433: Unparsed Raw Web Content Delivery\n**Abstraction Level**: variant\n**Similarity Score**: 3.24\n**Source**: graph\n\nThis CWE does not apply as the vulnerability is not related to unparsed web content delivery.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 3.21\n**Source**: graph\n\nThe vulnerability is not related to a permissive list of allowed inputs.",
