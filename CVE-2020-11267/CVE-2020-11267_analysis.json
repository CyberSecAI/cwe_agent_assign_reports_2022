While other CWEs like **CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read)**, **CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset)**, and **CWE-124 (Buffer Underwrite)** were considered, the explicit mention of \"**Stack out-of-bounds write**\" directly aligns with **CWE-787**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  The **root cause** is the **Stack out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787).\n2.  The consequence is potential memory corruption and potentially code execution due to exceeding the buffer's boundaries.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** due to the explicit mention of \"**Stack out-of-bounds write**\" in the vulnerability description. The evidence directly supports this classification, and the retriever results confirm this as a highly relevant CWE.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"**Stack out-of-bounds write** occurs while setting up a cipher device if the provided IV length exceeds the max limit value\". This directly aligns with the definition of **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)**, where data is written past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately describes the **weakness**. The provided evidence is sufficient to directly map the vulnerability to this CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially
