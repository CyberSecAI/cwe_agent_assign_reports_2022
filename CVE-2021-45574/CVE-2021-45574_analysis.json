An authenticated user can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the affected devices.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"Certain NETGEAR devices are affected by **command injection** by an authenticated user.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this: \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** Post-authentication command injection\" and \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected devices.\"\n\nThe Retriever Results list CWE-77 as the top combined result, but the mapping guidance states that CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (**CWE-78**) was intended instead. CWE-78 is also listed in the Retriever Results.\n\nCWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability because the **command injection** vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected devices.\n\nCWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')) was considered, but the mapping guidance states that it is often misused when OS command injection (**CWE-78**) was intended instead.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n\n## CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n\n## CWE-162: Improper Neutralization of Trailing Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n\n## CWE-150: Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 9944.92\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 9855.30\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 9669.78\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 9630.79\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 9619.84\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n\n## CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n\n## CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: variant\n**Similarity Score**: 3.88\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 3.65\n\n## CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 3.65",
