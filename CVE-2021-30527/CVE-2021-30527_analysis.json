This indicates that it is a specific type of memory corruption issue, which aligns well with the vulnerability description. CWE-416 is child of CWE-825 and CWE-672.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration\"]\n\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe825,cwe672 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use after free**, leading to heap corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description and CVE reference.\n\nThe key phrase \"**use after free**\" is directly mentioned in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary, indicating that the memory is being reused after it has been freed. The impact is described as \"heap corruption,\" further suggesting a memory management issue.\n\nThe retriever results also highlight CWE-416 [Use After Free] as the top candidate.\n\nThe relationship analysis confirms that CWE-416 is a variant.\n\n```\n## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **use after free**\n```\n\n```\n \"Weaknesses\": [\n      \"Use after free\"\n    ],\n```\n\nBased on this evidence, CWE-416 [Use After Free] is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.
