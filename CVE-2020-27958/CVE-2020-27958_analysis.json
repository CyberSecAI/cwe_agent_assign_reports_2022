CWE-1336 is a more specific case of code injection that occurs when a template engine is used. Additionally, the peer relationship between CWE-1336 and CWE-917 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement) was considered, as expression languages are often used within template engines.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe917[\"CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe1336 -->|PEEROF| cwe917\n    cwe1336 -->|PEEROF| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1336 primary\n    class cwe94,cwe917,cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper handling of user-supplied input** within the Job Composer application. This leads to an **improper neutralization of special elements** when creating job templates, ultimately resulting in a potential **injection vulnerability**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine). This selection is based on the vulnerability description, which indicates that the Job Composer app allows remote authenticated users to provide **crafted input in a job template**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause of the vulnerability** is the **improper escaping of user input** when creating job templates. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-1336, which states: \"The product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.\"\n\nThe choice of CWE-1336 is further supported by the MITRE mapping guidance, which designates it as \"Allowed\" and notes that it is at the Base level of abstraction, a preferred level for mapping root causes.\n\nCWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) was considered because the lack of proper sanitization of user input could lead to XSS. However, CWE-1336 is more specific to the use of template engines, making it a more accurate representation of the **root cause**. Therefore, CWE-79 is considered a secondary candidate, as it may be a consequence of the primary weakness.\n\nThe assessment is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which highlight the **improper handling of user input** and the **lack of proper escaping** within the Job Composer app.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the connection between CWE-1336 and other related CWEs, such as CWE-94 and CWE-917. This helped to refine the understanding of the vulnerability and ensure that the most appropriate CWE was selected.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately represent the **root cause** of the vulnerability and are consistent with the MITRE mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
