Choosing CWE-522 as the primary, even though it's a class, is influenced by the description which focuses on the **insufficient protection** aspect.\nThe Mermaid diagram visualizes this hierarchical relationship.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe549[\"CWE-549: Missing Password Field Masking\"]\n    \n    cwe549 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe522 primary\n    class cwe549 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **autocomplete enabled password field** which leads to stored credentials that can be captured by an attacker who gains control over the user's computer.\n- **Root Cause:** **autocomplete enabled password field**\n- **Weakness:** Stored credentials insufficiently protected\n- **Impact:** Credentials captured by attacker\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the analysis focused on the **autocomplete enabled password field** as the root cause. However, the core issue is the **insufficient protection** of credentials, highlighted by the \"stored credentials can be captured\" impact.\nThe evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section clearly states the root cause as \"**autocomplete enabled password field**\" and the impact as \"stored credentials can be captured.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" reinforces this by stating the \"**root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists because the password field in a form has autocomplete enabled\" and \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The autocomplete attribute is enabled on a password field, leading to potential storage of credentials.\"\n\nThe retriever results suggested CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) as a strong candidate. The description of CWE-522, \"The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval,\" aligns well with the vulnerability description.\n\nWhile CWE-549 (Missing Password Field Masking) is also relevant, it is more about not masking the password during entry. The current scenario deals with storing the credentials due to autocomplete. The selection of CWE-522 is further supported by its higher relevance score in the retriever results.\n\nTherefore, CWE-522 is chosen as the primary CWE to represent the **insufficient protection** of the credentials, and CWE-549 is chosen as the secondary CWE to further explain the **missing password field masking** weakness. This decision is based on the evidence provided, the retriever results, and the CWE specifications.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
