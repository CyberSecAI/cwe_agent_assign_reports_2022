The retriever results suggested considering its parent CWE, CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')), but CWE-366 is more specific and thus more appropriate. CWE-366 is a child of CWE-362 and CWE-662 (Improper Synchronization).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe366[\"CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe662[\"CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\"]\n    \n    cwe366 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe366 -->|CHILDOF| cwe662\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe366 primary\n    class cwe362, cwe662 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** that the `Future` type in the `tiny_future` crate lacks `Send` and `Sync` trait bounds. This allows non-thread-safe types to be used within `Future`s, leading to a **Race Condition within a Thread (CWE-366)** and ultimately causing data races.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis focuses on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability in the `tiny_future` crate. The key evidence lies in the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary, which states that the **Future does not have bounds on its Send and Sync traits**. This **weakness** allows non-thread-safe types to be used within `Future`s, resulting in data races in concurrent programs.\n\nThe retriever results listed CWE-366 (Race Condition within a Thread) as the top combined result. Given the **weakness** and the resulting data races, CWE-366 accurately captures the essence of the vulnerability. The fact that the Future type lacked `Send` and `Sync` trait bounds makes it possible for multiple threads to access and modify the same data concurrently, leading to a race condition.\n\nOther CWEs such as CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) were considered but deemed less specific. CWE-366 is a child of CWE-362 and is more appropriate here.\n\nThe decision is based on the provided evidence and relationship insights, indicating that the selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.
