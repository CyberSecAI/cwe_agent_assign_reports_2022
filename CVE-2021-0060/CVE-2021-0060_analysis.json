It is related to CWE-657 (Violation of Secure Design Principles) and CWE-693 (Protection Mechanism Failure) through ChildOf relationships. CWE-280, a Base-level weakness, relates to the improper handling of insufficient permissions or privileges, and has a PeerOf relationship with CWE-274 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges).\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe653[\"CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\"]\n    cwe657[\"CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\"]\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    cwe280[\"CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\"]\n    cwe274[\"CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\"]\n\n    cwe653 -->|CHILDOF| cwe657\n    cwe653 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693\n    cwe280 -->|PEEROF| cwe274\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe653 primary\n    class cwe280 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient compartmentalization** (CWE-653), leading to a potential escalation of privilege. An authenticated user with physical access can exploit this **weakness**.\n  - Root Cause: **Insufficient Compartmentalization** (CWE-653)\n  - Impact: Escalation of Privilege\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"**Insufficient compartmentalization** in HECI subsystem for the Intel(R) SPS before versions SPS_E5_04.01.04.516.0, SPS_E5_04.04.04.033.0, SPS_E5_04.04.03.281.0, SPS_E5_03.01.03.116.0, SPS_E3_05.01.04.309.0, SPS_02.04.00.101.0, SPS_SoC-A_05.00.03.114.0, SPS_SoC-X_04.00.04.326.0, SPS_SoC-X_03.00.03.117.0, IGN_E5_91.00.00.167.0, SPS_PHI_03.01.03.078.0 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via physical access.\" The root cause is **insufficient compartmentalization**, which directly aligns with CWE-653 (Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization). The description indicates that this **weakness** can lead to privilege escalation, which is the impact.\n\nThe retriever results also support CWE-653 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-280 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges) was considered because the vulnerability involves privilege escalation, which implies that permissions or privileges are not being correctly managed. However, CWE-653 is a more direct and precise match for the **root cause** described in the vulnerability.\n\nTherefore, CWE-653 is selected as the primary CWE due to its direct relevance to the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
