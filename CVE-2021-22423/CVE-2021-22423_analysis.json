Integer overflow can lead to miscalculation of buffer sizes, which can then cause an out-of-bounds write. The hierarchy shows that CWE-190 is a child of CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation).

The Retriever Results also ranked CWE-190 as the top candidate.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"A component of the HarmonyOS has a Out-of-bounds Write Vulnerability. Local attackers may exploit this vulnerability to cause **integer overflow**.\"\n\nThe relationship analysis highlights that CWE-190 can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a child of CWE-119. This shows a potential chain where the integer overflow can lead to memory corruption.\n\nBased on this analysis, the selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-190 accurately reflects the root cause, while CWE-787 describes the resulting impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
