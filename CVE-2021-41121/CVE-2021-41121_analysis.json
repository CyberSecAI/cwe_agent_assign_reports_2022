CWE-787 represents a more specific type of memory corruption. The peer relationship between CWE-415 (Double Free) and other memory corruption CWEs also influenced the decision, as double frees can lead to memory corruption, but it is not the direct cause in this case.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe415[\"CWE-415: Double Free\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe415 -->|PEEROF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe415 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect pointer** to the top of the stack, which leads to **memory corruption**, and potentially exploitable conditions.\n  - Root Cause: Incorrect stack pointer\n  - Weakness: Memory corruption\n  - Impact: Undefined behavior, crashes, exploitable conditions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the description of the vulnerability which clearly states \"memory corruption issue that occurs because of an **incorrect pointer** to the the top of the stack.\" The CVE reference summary further states \"The vulnerability arises from an **incorrect pointer** to the top of the stack when a function call is made inside a literal struct.
