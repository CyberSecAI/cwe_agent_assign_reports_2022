Although CWE-1390 is a parent, CWE-522 more accurately captures the specific weakness related to how credentials are protected. Another important aspect is the lack of a salt with the password hash could lead to a separate CWE of CWE-916 but the information is insufficient.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n\n    cwe522 -- CHILDOF --> cwe1390\n    cwe916 -- CHILDOF --> cwe328\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe522 primary\n    class cwe1390 secondary\n    class cwe916 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient protection of credentials**, leading to the impact of an attacker being able to **read out password hashes**, and potentially gaining unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **insufficient protection of credentials**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms this, stating: \"The vulnerability is due to **insufficiently protected credentials** in the Web-Based Management (WBM) interface of WAGO industrial managed switches\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: **Insufficiently Protected Credentials** (CWE-522).\" This direct statement strongly supports the selection of CWE-522.\n\nThe graph relationships helped to refine the selection. While CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) is a parent of CWE-522, the latter is more specific and better describes the actual weakness.\n\nI considered the other CWEs from the Retriever Results, but they were less directly relevant. For example, CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a general impact rather than a root cause.\n\nMy decision to select CWE-522 is based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the supporting context provided by the relationship analysis. CWE-522 is at the optimal level of specificity, accurately representing the weakness while adhering to MITRE's mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
