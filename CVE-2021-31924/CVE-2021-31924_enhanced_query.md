# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-31924

## Vulnerability Description
Yubico pam-u2f before 1.1.1 has a **logic issue** that, depending on the pam-u2f configuration and the application used, could lead to a local PIN bypass. This issue does not allow user presence (touch) or cryptographic signature verification to be bypassed, so an attacker would still need to physically possess and interact with the YubiKey or another enrolled authenticator. If pam-u2f is configured to require PIN authentication, and the application using pam-u2f allows the user to submit NULL as the PIN, pam-u2f will attempt to perform a FIDO2 authentication without PIN. If this authentication is successful, the PIN requirement is bypassed.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **logic issue**
- **impact:** local PIN bypass
- **product:** Yubico pam-u2f
- **version:** before 1.1.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
A logic flaw in the `pam-u2f` module allows a bypass of the PIN entry requirement during FIDO2 authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **PIN Bypass:** The core vulnerability is that if an application using `pam-u2f` allows a user to submit a NULL PIN, `pam-u2f` will proceed with FIDO2 authentication *without* verifying the PIN, effectively bypassing the PIN requirement.
- **Logic Issue**: The PAM module returns control to the application when PIN entry is needed. If the application allows submitting a NULL PIN, the PAM module fails to enforce PIN verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with local access to an application using `pam-u2f` and configured to require a PIN can authenticate successfully without providing the correct PIN.
- This does NOT bypass the user presence (touch) requirement or cryptographic signature verification. The attacker still needs physical access and interaction with the authenticator (e.g., YubiKey).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **Application Interaction:** The attacker needs to interact with an application that uses `pam-u2f` for authentication and allows the submission of a NULL PIN.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:**  The attacker must have a local user account on the system.
- **Application Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to exploit a weakness in the application that calls the `pam-u2f` module, allowing them to pass a NULL PIN.
- **Physical Access:** The attacker still needs physical access to the user's FIDO2 authenticator (e.g., YubiKey) to complete the authentication after bypassing the PIN.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects `pam-u2f` version 1.1.0, and is fixed in version 1.1.1 and later.
- The severity of the vulnerability is considered moderate because it requires a combination of local access, a specific application vulnerability and physical access to the security key.

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.






## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function

- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

### Extended Description


Many password storage mechanisms compute a hash and store the hash, instead of storing the original password in plaintext. In this design, authentication involves accepting an incoming password, computing its hash, and comparing it to the stored hash.


Many hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. However, this efficiency is a problem for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker's workload for brute-force password cracking. If an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method (such as SQL injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by computing hashes efficiently. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing (such as cloud computing) and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware. In such a scenario, an efficient hash algorithm helps the attacker.


There are several properties of a hash scheme that are relevant to its strength against an offline, massively-parallel attack:


  - The amount of CPU time required to compute the hash ("stretching")

  - The amount of memory required to compute the hash ("memory-hard" operations)

  - Including a random value, along with the password, as input to the hash computation ("salting")

  - Given a hash, there is no known way of determining an input (e.g., a password) that produces this hash value, other than by guessing possible inputs ("one-way" hashing)

  - Relative to the number of all possible hashes that can be generated by the scheme, there is a low likelihood of producing the same hash for multiple different inputs ("collision resistance")

Note that the security requirements for the product may vary depending on the environment and the value of the passwords. Different schemes might not provide all of these properties, yet may still provide sufficient security for the environment. Conversely, a solution might be very strong in preserving one property, which still being very weak for an attack against another property, or it might not be able to significantly reduce the efficiency of a massively-parallel attack.
