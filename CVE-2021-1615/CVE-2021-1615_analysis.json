This is further related to CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime) as a child. CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) can follow CWE-410, representing the impact. CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) which is allocation of resources without limits or throttling and also a child of CWE-400. The Base level of abstraction was chosen as it provides the most specific representation of the weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe410[\"CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n\n    cwe410 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n    cwe410 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe400\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe410 primary\n    class cwe664,cwe400,cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient buffer allocation** (CWE-410), leading to resource exhaustion, which causes a denial-of-service (DoS) condition (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **insufficient buffer allocation**, which directly leads to resource exhaustion and a denial-of-service condition.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"This vulnerability is due to **insufficient buffer allocation**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust available resources and cause a DoS condition on an affected AP, as well as a DoS condition for client traffic traversing the AP.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating: \"RootCause: Insufficient buffer allocation in the packet processing functionality of Cisco Embedded Wireless Controller (EWC) Software.\"\n\nGiven the evidence, CWE-410 (Insufficient Resource Pool) is the most appropriate primary CWE because the root cause is the **insufficient buffer allocation**, leading to resource exhaustion.\n\nCWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) was considered, as the application allocates resources without proper limits. This is a valid secondary concern, as **insufficient buffer allocation** can be seen as a lack of limits on buffer usage.\n\nCWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) was also considered. Crafted traffic could include a quantity, such as size, that is not correctly validated, leading to the buffer exhaustion.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was considered but not chosen as the primary CWE because it is a more general consequence of the underlying **insufficient buffer allocation**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause (**insufficient buffer allocation**) and its immediate consequences (resource exhaustion, DoS).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n-

(Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-664: Improper

is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-406: Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume (Network Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently monitor or control transmitted network traffic volume, so that an actor can cause the product to transmit more traffic than should be allowed for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's resource pool is not large enough to handle peak demand, which allows an attacker to prevent others from accessing the resource by using a (relatively) large number of requests for resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n##
