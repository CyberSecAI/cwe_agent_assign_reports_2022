CWE-798 is a base CWE and a parent of CWE-259. CWE-321 is a peer of CWE-259 and also a child of CWE-798. The selection of CWE-259 is based on the specific nature of the **hard-coded password**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    \n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe259 -- PEEROF --> cwe321\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe259 primary\n    class cwe798,cwe321 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **hard-coded password**, which leads to the exposure of sensitive project information.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n  - **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, compromise of KNX installations\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **hard-coded password**. The vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary clearly indicate the use of a **hard-coded password**, `ETS5Password`, along with a salt value of `Ivan Medvedev`. This allows local users to read project information.\n\nThe retriever results also pointed towards CWE-259, CWE-798, and CWE-321 as potential candidates.\n\nThe final decision to select CWE-259 as the primary CWE is based on the fact that the vulnerability specifically involves a **hard-coded password**, as opposed to a more general credential or cryptographic key. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary supports this decision.\n\nThe CWE-259 is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains a **hard-coded password**, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe use of a **hard-coded cryptographic key** significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains **hard-coded credentials**, such as a password or cryptographic key.",
