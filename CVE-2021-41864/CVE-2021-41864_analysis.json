CWE-190 is a child of CWE-682, which represents \"Incorrect Calculation\". CWE-190 can precede CWE-119, \"Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer,\" which in turn can lead to out-of-bounds writes. The relationship shows a clear progression from an integer overflow to memory corruption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe682[\"CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation\"]\n    \n    cwe190 -->|CHILDOF| cwe682\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe119 --> cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe119,cwe682 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) during memory allocation, leading to an undersized buffer. This undersized buffer then allows for an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787) when data is written to it. The root cause is the integer overflow, and the impact is the out-of-bounds write.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, which explicitly states that the vulnerability is due to an \"eBPF multiplication **integer overflow** with a resultant out-of-bounds write.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating that the \"vulnerability stems from an integer overflow... This overflow leads to a smaller-than-expected size passed to the allocator,\" further causing \"an out-of-bounds write.\"\n\nThe retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-190 as the primary candidate, with a high similarity score. CWE-787 is a secondary consideration due to its direct connection to the out-of-bounds write resulting from the overflow.\n\nCWE-190 and CWE-787 are selected because they accurately describe the root cause and impact of the vulnerability, respectively, and are at the optimal level of specificity (Base level).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
