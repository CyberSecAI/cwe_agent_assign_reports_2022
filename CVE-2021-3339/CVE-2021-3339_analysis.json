This leads to **Improper Authorization (CWE-285)**, where unauthorized users can access restricted resources. This can further be specified as **Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863)**, where there is an authorization check, but it is implemented incorrectly. The vulnerability can also be viewed as **Direct Request (CWE-425)**, where restricted URLs, scripts, or files are directly accessed without adequate authorization.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis points to an authorization issue where the product **does not constrain web-page access to members of a security group**.\n\nThe Retriever results also suggest **CWE-285 (Improper Authorization)** and **CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization)** as potential candidates. The vulnerability description clearly states that the application **does not constrain web-page access**, which falls under the definition of **Improper Authorization**.\n\n*   **CWE-285 (Improper Authorization):** This CWE is a class-level weakness describing a scenario where the product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check. The description states the product **does not constrain web-page access**, directly matching the CWE definition. Although the mapping guidance discourages its use because it is high-level and suggests lower-level CWEs, it is the most appropriate primary classification given the available information.\n*   **CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization):** This CWE describes a situation where an authorization check is performed, but it is done incorrectly. This is a more specific scenario than CWE-285. Given that the vulnerability description only mentions that access is not constrained, it is reasonable to assume there's potentially an attempt to authorize which is implemented incorrectly. The mapping guidance suggests examining children of this entry to see if there is a better fit.\n*   **CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'))**: This CWE describes a scenario where the web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files. The description states the product **does not constrain web-page access** to the *Search Screen and Profile Screen* URLs, directly matching the CWE definition.\n\nThe selection of CWE-285 as the primary CWE and CWE-863 and CWE-425 as secondary CWEs offer the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:",
