The vulnerability description explicitly states the ability to login with empty or invalid passwords, indicating an authentication bypass. CWE-307 is a child of CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and represents a related weakness, particularly if the system allows unlimited login attempts without proper restrictions, although the description is not specific about that.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe307[\"CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe799[\"CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\"]\n\n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe307 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe307 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe307 -->|CHILDOF| cwe799\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe288 primary\n    class cwe307 secondary\n    class cwe284,cwe287,cwe1390,cwe799 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **flawed authentication mechanism**, leading to the ability to **bypass authentication** entirely by using empty or invalid passwords. This directly results in **unauthorized access to the system**, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure, data modification, and denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and retriever results, strongly pointed towards authentication-related CWEs. The primary focus was on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **flawed authentication mechanism** that allows bypassing authentication.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions that a user can log in with an empty password or an invalid password, which directly corresponds to **CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel)**. This CWE accurately captures the core issue, where an alternate path (empty or invalid password) bypasses the intended authentication process.\n\nThe secondary candidate, **CWE-307 (Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts)**, was considered due to the possibility that the system lacks proper controls to prevent repeated login attempts with incorrect credentials. However, the description doesn't explicitly state this, so it's a less direct fit.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-288** as the primary CWE is based on the direct evidence of authentication bypass using alternate credentials, making it the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. The CWE is at the base level of abstraction, aligning with the goal of identifying the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
