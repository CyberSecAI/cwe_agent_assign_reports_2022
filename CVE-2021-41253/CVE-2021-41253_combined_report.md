## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-457 **Use of Uninitialized Variable**, a variant of **CWE-665 Improper Initialization**. Because of the **improper initialization**, the secondary weakness that follows is **CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow**. The **improper initialization** leads to incorrect size calculations when appending untrusted data using zycore string functions. This directly results in a **heap buffer overflow** when the calculated size is insufficient, leading to memory corruption.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with **CWE-457 Use of Uninitialized Variable**. This **missing initialization** leads to **incorrect size calculations** during string appending operations. The **incorrect calculations** then result in **CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow** when untrusted data is appended, culminating in heap memory corruption.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified **CWE-457 Use of Uninitialized Variable** as the primary weakness due to the **improper initialization** of the string object within the formatter buffer. This aligns with the **root_cause** identified in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The subsequent **heap buffer overflow** is then classified as **CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow**.

The relationship graph shows that **CWE-457** is a child of **CWE-665**, and **CWE-122** can follow **CWE-457**, indicating the sequence of events in the vulnerability.

The selection of **CWE-457** is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the coding error (**missing initialization**) that led to the vulnerability. While **CWE-665 Improper Initialization** is a parent class, **CWE-457** provides a more precise characterization of the weakness.

The evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary strongly supports this assessment. The vulnerability description key phrases "rootcause: **improper initialization**" and "weakness: **heap buffer overflow**" directly correlate with the selected CWEs.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-41253

## Vulnerability Description
Zydis is an x86/x86-64 disassembler library. Users of Zydis versions v3.2.0 and older that use the string functions provided in `zycore` in order to append untrusted user data to the formatter buffer within their custom formatter hooks can run into **heap buffer overflow**s. Older versions of Zydis failed to properly initialize the string object within the formatter buffer, forgetting to initialize a few fields, leaving their value to chance. This could then in turn cause zycore functions like `ZyanStringAppend` to make incorrect calculations for the new target size, resulting in heap memory corruption. This does not affect the regular uncustomized Zydis formatter, because Zydis internally doesnt use the string functions in zycore that act upon these fields. However, because the zycore string functions are the intended way to work with the formatter buffer for users of the library that wish to extend the formatter, we still consider this to be a vulnerability in Zydis. This bug is patched starting in version 3.2.1. As a workaround, users may refrain from using zycore string functions in their formatter hooks until updating to a patched version.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-118
ChildOf -> CWE-20

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist




## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Overflow: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
Wraparound: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
wrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of "wraparound"

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with "overflow," "underflow," and "wraparound" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called "underflows").


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.

**[Terminology]** 

"Integer overflow" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.


A "wraparound" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.


"Overflow" is sometimes conflated with "wraparound" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.


The "overflow" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use "overflow" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using "underflow" for exceeding the minimum.


Some people use "overflow" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses "underflow" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.


See [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.


**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.




## CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results.

### Extended Description
In some languages such as C and C++, stack variables are not initialized by default. They generally contain junk data with the contents of stack memory before the function was invoked. An attacker can sometimes control or read these contents. In other languages or conditions, a variable that is not explicitly initialized can be given a default value that has security implications, depending on the logic of the program. The presence of an uninitialized variable can sometimes indicate a typographic error in the code.

### Alternative Terms

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2008-3688:** Chain: A denial of service may be caused by an uninitialized variable (CWE-457) allowing an infinite loop (CWE-835) resulting from a connection to an unresponsive server.
- **CVE-2008-0081:** Uninitialized variable leads to code execution in popular desktop application.




## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read




## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.




## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-125
ChildOf -> CWE-788

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** These problems may be resultant from missing sentinel values (CWE-463) or trusting a user-influenced input length variable.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-1733:** Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code
- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: "Heartbleed" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.
- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.




## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

### Extended Description


Code frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-400
ChildOf -> CWE-665
ChildOf -> CWE-400

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This entry is different from uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) in that there are other weaknesses that are related to inability to control resource consumption, such as holding on to a resource too long after use, or not correctly keeping track of active resources so that they can be managed and released when they are finished (CWE-771).

**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. "Resource exhaustion" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2009-4017:** Language interpreter does not restrict the number of temporary files being created when handling a MIME request with a large number of parts..
- **CVE-2009-2726:** Driver does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions, causing stack consumption.




## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
off-by-five: An "off-by-five" error was reported for sudo in 2002 (CVE-2002-0184), but that is more like a "length calculation" error.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682
CanPrecede -> CWE-617
CanPrecede -> CWE-170
CanPrecede -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is not always a buffer overflow. For example, an off-by-one error could be a factor in a partial comparison, a read from the wrong memory location, an incorrect conditional, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-0252:** Off-by-one error allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via requests that do not contain newlines.
- **CVE-2001-1391:** Off-by-one vulnerability in driver allows users to modify kernel memory.
- **CVE-2002-0083:** Off-by-one error allows local users or remote malicious servers to gain privileges.




## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.

### Extended Description
Some regular expression engines have a feature called "backtracking". If the token cannot match, the engine "backtracks" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.
 Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:


  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.

  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.

  - The input can be long enough.

 Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. 

### Alternative Terms
ReDoS: ReDoS is an abbreviation of "Regular expression Denial of Service".
Regular Expression Denial of Service: While this term is attack-focused, this is commonly used to describe the weakness.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-5243:** server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.
- **CVE-2021-21317:** npm package for user-agent parser prone to ReDoS due to overlapping capture groups
- **CVE-2019-16215:** Markdown parser uses inefficient regex when processing a message, allowing users to cause CPU consumption and delay preventing processing of other messages.




## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not initialize a critical resource.

### Extended Description
Many resources require initialization before they can be properly used. If a resource is not initialized, it could contain unpredictable or expired data, or it could be initialized to defaults that are invalid. This can have security implications when the resource is expected to have certain properties or values.
