This parent-child relationship guided the selection, ensuring that the most specific CWE was chosen. CWE-760 directly addresses the use of a predictable salt, a detail present in the vulnerability description, whereas CWE-916 is a broader category.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe760[\"CWE-760: Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    \n    cwe760 -->|CHILDOF| cwe916\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe760 primary\n    class cwe916 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a one-way hash with a predictable salt** (CWE-760), which leads to the ability to decrypt passwords. The root cause is the predictable salt. The impact is that an attacker already in possession of the password store can decrypt the passwords by means of precomputed tables.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the most specific CWE that matches the vulnerability description. The description clearly indicates a **\"use of one-way hash with a predictable salt\"**. The retriever results also list CWE-760 as the top match.\n\nThe relationship analysis confirms that CWE-760 is a variant of CWE-916, providing a more granular classification.\n\nThe final decision is based on the strong evidence in the vulnerability description and the retriever results. CWE-760 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability, i.e., the **use of a predictable salt**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-760: Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Status**: Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a one-way cryptographic hash against an input that should not be reversible, such as a password, but the product uses a predictable salt as part of the input.\n\n### Extended Description\n\nThis makes it easier for attackers to pre-compute the hash value using dictionary attack techniques such as rainbow tables, effectively disabling the protection that an unpredictable salt would provide.\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same digest (birthday attack).\n\n### Extended Description\n\nA hash function is defined as an algorithm that maps arbitrarily sized data into a fixed-sized digest (output) such that the following properties hold:\n\n 1.
