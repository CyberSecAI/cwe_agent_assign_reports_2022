This aligns with CWE-1284. The consequence of this **improper validation** is that the system attempts a very large memory allocation, which matches CWE-789.\n\nCWE-789 is selected as the primary CWE as it directly represents the core issue: **memory allocation with an excessive size value** due to the **improper size checking**.\n\nCWE-1284 is considered as a secondary CWE because the root cause is the **improper validation of specified quantity in input**, which allows for a **memory allocation with excessive size value**.\n\nCWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is also a valid candidate, but CWE-789 is a more specific variant of CWE-770 and thus is preferred.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, representing the vulnerability's root cause (CWE-1284), the immediate consequence (CWE-789), and the broader context of resource management (CWE-770).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n**Did Not Select**: This CWE focuses on sensitive information not being removed, which is not the primary issue in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n**Did Not Select**: This CWE is too general and doesn't capture the specific issue of excessive memory allocation due to improper size validation.\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n**Did Not Select**: While this CWE is related to memory allocation issues, it's not as directly relevant as CWE-789, which specifically addresses excessive size values.\n\n## CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.\n**Did Not Select**: This CWE focuses on failing to release resources, whereas the described vulnerability is about allocating excessive memory in the first place.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n**SELECTED -
