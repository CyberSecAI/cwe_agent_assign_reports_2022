CWE-347 is a child of CWE-345, Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity, which is a Class-level CWE. CWE-287 is a class level CWE and a parent of CWE-306.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper access control configuration**, leading to a **lack of signature validation** on firmware updates, which allows an attacker to install **malicious firmware**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description and CVE reference links highlight the **lack of signature validation** as the primary issue. This directly aligns with CWE-347, Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature. The device does not verify that the firmware updates are legitimate, allowing an attacker to masquerade as the update server and install malicious firmware.\n\nThe analysis also considered CWE-287, Improper Authentication, due to the **improper access control configuration** mentioned in the vulnerability description. While access control is a factor, the core issue is the **lack of signature validation** on the firmware itself.\n\nThe decision to prioritize CWE-347 was based on the detailed description of the vulnerability and the explicit mention of **lack of signature validation** in the CVE reference. This aligns with the MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-347, which states that it is a Base level of abstraction and a preferred level for mapping to root causes.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
