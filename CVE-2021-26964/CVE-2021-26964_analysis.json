The secondary CWE, CWE-288 **Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel**, is related to authentication bypass and is a child of both CWE-306 **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** and CWE-284 **Improper Access Control**. It is also a peer of CWE-420 **Unprotected Alternate Channel**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe420[\"CWE-420: Unprotected Alternate Channel\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe306\n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe288 -->|PEEROF| cwe420\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe288 secondary\n    class cwe284,cwe306,cwe420 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves an **authenticated remote attacker** leveraging a lower privileged account to **improperly access and modify devices and management user details**, leading to privilege escalation and unauthorized changes to network details. This can be viewed as an authentication bypass leading to incorrect authorization.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered the **improper access and modify devices and management user details** to be a primary factor. This, along with the provided description, led to the selection of CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** as the primary weakness due to the **attacker using a lower privileged account to change management user or device details**. This is consistent with the description of CWE-863, which covers scenarios where the product performs an authorization check, but performs it incorrectly. The secondary weakness is CWE-288 **Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel**, as the attacker bypassed the intended authorization mechanism using a lower privileged account.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-863 is based on the vulnerability description stating that an \"attacker using a lower privileged account to change management user or device details,\" which is an example of an **incorrect authorization**. The evidence for CWE-288 is that this was done by an **authenticated remote attacker**, implying a bypass of some sort.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-863 being a Class and CWE-288 being a Base. While a more specific variant of CWE-863 might exist, the information available does not allow for a more precise mapping.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated",
