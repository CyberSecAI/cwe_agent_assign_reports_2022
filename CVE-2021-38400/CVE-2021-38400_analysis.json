CWE-916 is a child of CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash) and CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm). Although CWE-328 is a parent of CWE-916, it is less specific than CWE-916 for this vulnerability, so CWE-916 is a better choice. CWE-798 is also considered because **hardcoded credentials** could be a reason for the weak password hash.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe328\n    cwe916 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe916 primary\n    class cwe328,cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **use of a password hash with insufficient computational effort (CWE-916)**. This **weakness** allows an attacker with physical access to extract the password hash and then perform a brute-force attack to reverse engineer the password. The impact is unauthorized access to the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **root cause**, which is the **use of a password hash with insufficient computational effort**, as stated in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"*Root Cause: Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort*\". The vulnerability description states that an attacker with physical access can extract the password hash for brute force reverse engineering of the system password.\n\nThe retriever results also support this, with CWE-916 being the top result. The description of CWE-916 aligns with the vulnerability, as it involves generating a hash for a password but not providing sufficient computational effort to prevent brute-force attacks.\n\nCWE-328, **Use of Weak Hash**, was considered because CWE-916 is a child of CWE-328. However, CWE-916 is more specific because it focuses on password hashes and insufficient computational effort, so it is a better fit.\n\nCWE-798, **Use of Hard-coded Credentials**, was also considered because it's possible the **weakness** stems from hardcoded credentials being easily cracked, but this is not explicitly stated.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description and the retriever results, which indicate that the **root cause** is the **use of a password hash with insufficient computational effort (CWE-916)**. This is the most specific and accurate CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
