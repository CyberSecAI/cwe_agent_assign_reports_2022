The vulnerability's description and CVE reference content directly point to prototype pollution, making CWE-1321 the most specific and appropriate choice. CWE-471 is related through the \"CanPrecede\" relationship to CWE-1321, indicating a potential weakness that enables the prototype pollution. However, the direct evidence supports CWE-1321 more strongly. CWE-915 is a parent of CWE-1321. Choosing the child (CWE-1321) provides a more specific classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1321[\"CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\"]\n    cwe915[\"CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-determined Program Logic\"]\n    cwe471[\"CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\"]\n\n    cwe1321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe915\n    cwe1321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe1321 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe471\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1321 primary\n    class cwe471,cwe915 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of input validation** in the `expand()` function, leading to **improperly controlled modification of object prototype attributes (CWE-1321)**. This **prototype pollution** can then lead to denial of service and potentially remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**prototype pollution**\", and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary details how the `expand()` function **does not validate the type of object before assigning a value to a property**, leading to the ability to **manipulate the prototype of an object**. This aligns perfectly with CWE-1321, \"Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution').\"\n\nThe retriever results also support this selection, with CWE-1321 being the top match.\n\nCWE-471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data) was considered because prototype properties are often assumed to be immutable. While this could be a contributing factor, the core issue is the **lack of control over modifying the prototype**, making CWE-1321 more directly relevant.\n\nCWE-915 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes) was considered as a parent of CWE-1321 but is less specific.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-1321 is a variant that directly describes the **prototype pollution** vulnerability.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for re-use, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly \"clean up\" and remove temporary or supporting resources after they have been used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
