CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a Variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). Since the vulnerability is specifically a heap-based buffer overflow, the more specific CWE-122 is the best fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple: a **heap buffer overflow** (CWE-122) leads to heap corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description, which explicitly states \"Heap buffer overflow.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating \"A heap buffer overflow was found\".\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"heap buffer overflow\". This is a variant-level CWE, providing a specific classification.\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) were considered but not chosen because they are more general. While technically correct, CWE-122 provides a more precise classification of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in
