The product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory. |\n| CWE-36 | Absolute Path Traversal | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The product does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as \"/abs/path\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory. |\n| CWE-73 | External Control of File Name or Path | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-22, which is a base-level weakness describing improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory. CWE-36, Absolute Path Traversal, is a child of CWE-22 and represents a specific type of path traversal. CWE-73, External Control of File Name or Path, can precede CWE-22, indicating that external control of the file path can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe36[\"CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    \n    cwe36 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe22\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe36,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the external control of the file path (CWE-73), leading to the improper limitation of the pathname (CWE-22), specifically an absolute path traversal (CWE-36), which allows an attacker to read arbitrary files.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the vulnerability as an **absolute path traversal**, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files. The retriever results suggested CWE-22, CWE-36, and CWE-73 as potential mappings.\n\nBased on the vulnerability description, the primary weakness is the **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory (CWE-22)**, as the application **fails to properly neutralize special elements** in the pathname, allowing traversal outside the restricted directory. The specific type of path traversal is **absolute path traversal (CWE-36)**, making it a more specific child of CWE-22. Additionally, the vulnerability involves **external control of the file name or path (CWE-73)**, as the attacker can control the SearchString JSON field in the /home/download POST data.\n\nThe evidence for this assessment is derived from the vulnerability description's key phrase **\"absolute path traversal\"**, which indicates a path traversal vulnerability. The fact that the attacker can control the \"SearchString JSON field\" implies external control of the file path.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-22 representing the general path traversal weakness, CWE-36 representing the specific type of path traversal (absolute), and CWE-73 representing the external control aspect.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
