The secondary CWE is CWE-122, which describes the impact **heap-based buffer overflow**. CWE-190 is a child of CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation). CWE-122 is a child of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). CWE-190 can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe682[\"CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe190 -->|CHILDOF| cwe682\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n    class cwe682,cwe787,cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer wraparound** (CWE-190) in the `calloc` function. This leads to incorrect memory allocation, which results in a **heap-based buffer overflow** (CWE-122).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is an **integer wraparound** (CWE-190) in the `calloc` function, which leads to a **heap-based buffer overflow** (CWE-122).\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"eCosCentric eCosPro RTOS Versions 2.0.1 through 4.5.3 are vulnerable to **integer wraparound** in function calloc (an implementation of malloc). The unverified memory assignment can lead to arbitrary memory allocation, resulting in a **heap-based buffer overflow**.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms: \"Integer wraparound in the `calloc` function implementation within the eCosCentric eCosPro RTOS. This occurs because the size parameter for memory allocation is not properly validated, leading to an integer overflow/wraparound... The incorrect memory allocation due to the wraparound can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow.\"\n\nCWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) is the most appropriate CWE to describe the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The CWE description states: \"The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value.\" This perfectly matches the **integer wraparound** in the `calloc` function.\n\nCWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is a secondary CWE to describe the impact of the vulnerability. The CWE description states: \"A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().\" This matches the resulting **heap-based buffer overflow** due to incorrect memory allocation.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-190 as the top result with a high score, supporting its selection.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-191 (Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)): While related to integer issues, the vulnerability is specifically an **integer wraparound**, not an underflow.\n*   CWE-197 (Numeric Truncation Error): This CWE involves truncation during type conversion, which is not the primary issue in this vulnerability.\n*   CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input): While input validation is related, the core issue is the **integer wraparound** itself, not just the lack of validation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n## Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n### CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
