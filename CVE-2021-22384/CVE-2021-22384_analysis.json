While other CWEs like CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) are related, CWE-305 provides a more specific classification because the vulnerability involves a bypass due to a separate underlying weakness. The abstraction level of Base for CWE-305 is also preferred.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe305[\"CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe305 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe305 primary\n    class cwe1390,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a race condition leading to a potential authentication bypass.\n  - **Root Cause:** Race Condition\n  - **Weakness:** Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness (CWE-305)\n  - **Impact:** Information Disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting impact. The **root cause** of the vulnerability is a **race condition**, which leads to the **authentication bypass**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms the **race condition** as the root cause. The Retriever Results listed CWE-305 (Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness) as a highly relevant candidate. \n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-305 is found in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states the **weakness** as \"Race condition leading to potential authentication bypass.\" The \"Vulnerability Description\" also indicates that successful exploitation leads to \"authentication bypass\".\n\nThe selection of CWE-305 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **authentication bypass** resulting from a separate underlying issue (the **race condition**). The MITRE mapping guidance allows for the use of CWE-305 at the Base level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
