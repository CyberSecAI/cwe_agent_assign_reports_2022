No other child or parent relationships were strongly indicated in the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n    cwe915[\"CWE-915: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (\u0445\u043e\u0434]\n    \n    cwe502 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe502 -->|PEEROF| cwe915\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe502 primary\n    class cwe913,cwe915 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is simple:\n  1. **Root Cause:** **Deserialization** of Untrusted Data (CWE-502)\n  2. **Impact:** Remote Code Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly points to CWE-502 as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **deserialization** behavior. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms this by stating that the root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, allowing for the **deserialization** of untrusted data.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-502 as the top candidate with a high score. The MITRE mapping guidance allows the use of CWE-502 and confirms that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\nThe evidence supporting this is extracted from the \"Vulnerability Description\" which states \"These TCP services can be exploited due to **deserialization** behavior that is inherent to the .NET Remoting service\" and from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section that states \"The core weakness is the application's failure to sanitize or validate data before deserializing it. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects that can be executed during the deserialization process.\".\n\nI considered other CWEs such as CWE-923 (Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints) because .NET Remoting TCP ports are mentioned, but the root cause is the **deserialization** issue. I also considered CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), but while authentication might be a mitigating factor, it is not the primary weakness.\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) and CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) were also considered but deemed less relevant than CWE-502.\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:",
