The secondary CWEs, CWE-807 and CWE-1021, are also base-level CWEs. CWE-20 is a very general CWE and the other two help to add more context.\nCWE-1021 is a child of CWE-441, CWE-610 and CWE-451.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe807[\"CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\"]\n    cwe1021[\"CWE-1021: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames\"]\n    cwe441[\"CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary\"]\n    cwe610[\"CWE-610: Trust Boundary Violation\"]\n    cwe451[\"CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\"]\n    \n    cwe1021 -->|CHILDOF| cwe441\n    cwe1021 -->|CHILDOF| cwe610\n    cwe1021 -->|CHILDOF| cwe451\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe807,cwe1021 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **insufficient policy enforcement** (CWE-20), leading to a bypass of navigation restrictions.
