The vulnerability involves a **race condition** due to concurrent execution and improper synchronization. CWE-362 has child CWEs that could be more specific, but based on the provided information, CWE-362 itself provides a good fit as the root cause. The potential impacts of the **race condition**, such as double free (CWE-415) and memory leak (CWE-401), are related but secondary. CWE-415 and CWE-401 are variant level CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe415[\"CWE-415: Double Free\"]\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n\n    cwe415 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe362\n    cwe401 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe362\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe415,cwe401 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **race condition** (CWE-362) in `crossbeam-deque`. This **race condition** can lead to a double free (CWE-415) if tasks are allocated on the heap, or a memory leak (CWE-401) if tasks are forgotten and never popped.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability was identified as a **race condition** that can lead to double free or memory leak. The retriever results and the vulnerability description key phrases pointed towards CWE-362 as a strong candidate.\n\nThe primary focus is on the **race condition** itself (CWE-362). The description states that the \"result of the **race condition** is that one or more tasks in the worker queue can be popped twice instead of other tasks that are forgotten and never popped.\" This directly supports the choice of CWE-362.\n\nThe consequences of the **race condition**, such as double free (CWE-415) and memory leak (CWE-401), are also important to consider, but they are secondary effects of the primary weakness, which is the **race condition** itself.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-362 captures the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
