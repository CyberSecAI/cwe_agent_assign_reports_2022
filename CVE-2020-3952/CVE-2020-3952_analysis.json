It has child relationships to CWE-285 Improper Authorization and CWE-284 Improper Access Control. Given the vulnerability description speaks to **improper access controls**, but focuses on the authorization aspect, CWE-863 is the most appropriate given the evidence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of root cause is that the vmdir component of VMware vCenter Server **does not correctly implement access controls**, leading to **incorrect authorization**.\n  - The root cause is the **improper access controls**.\n  - The weakness is **incorrect authorization**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description states that vmdir \"**does not correctly implement access controls**\". The Retriever Results list CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization as the best match.\n\nCWE-863 description is: \"The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\" This matches the vulnerability description of \"**improper access controls**\"\n\nThe CWE-863 is at the Class level, and the Mapping Guidance states: \"This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\". However, there is insufficient information to select a more specific CWE.\n\nTherefore, the best CWE is CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n**Not Used:** Authentication is not mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n**Not Used:** Insufficient privileges are not mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n**Not Used:** Authentication is not mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n**Not Used:** Untrusted inputs are not mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
