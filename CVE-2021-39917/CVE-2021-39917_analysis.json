The relationship indicates that inefficient regular expression complexity is a specific type of resource consumption issue. CWE-400 is a class-level weakness and is a parent of several other CWEs that describe different ways to consume resources.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe407 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe407 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause**: an **inefficient regular expression (CWE-1333)**. This leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400)** and ultimately results in a **denial-of-service (DoS)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to CWE-1333 as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the **regular expression related to quick actions features was susceptible to catastrophic backtracking**, a key indicator of CWE-1333. The description also specifies that the impact is a denial of service, which aligns with the typical outcome of ReDoS attacks.\n\nThe retriever results also support this, with CWE-1333 being the top-ranked CWE. Other CWEs were considered, but they were either too general (e.g., CWE-400) or didn't accurately reflect the specific **root cause** of the vulnerability (e.g., authorization-related CWEs).\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was considered as a secondary CWE, as the ReDoS leads to excessive CPU consumption, which is a type of resource exhaustion. While CWE-400 is a valid high-level description of the impact, CWE-1333 provides a more precise characterization of the underlying **root cause**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1333 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the inefficient regular expression complexity that is the root cause of the vulnerability. Using a more general CWE like CWE-400 would obscure the specific nature of the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-838: Inappropriate Encoding for Output Context\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses or specifies an encoding when generating output to a downstream component, but the specified encoding is not the same as the encoding that is expected by the downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
