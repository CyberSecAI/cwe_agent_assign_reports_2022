## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain involves an **incorrect function call** (`sizeof` instead of an API method that checks for invalid pointers) leading to the use of `sizeof()` on a pointer type, which can be an incorrect calculation if the programmer intended to determine the size of the data that is being pointed to.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which clearly states that the root cause is an **incorrect function call**, specifically using `sizeof` on a pointer without validation. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further supports this by stating: "The vulnerability stems from an incorrect usage of memory profiling code... Specifically, the code directly called the `sizeof` function on a pointer without first validating if the pointer was valid."

The Retriever Results list CWE-467 as the top candidate, which is the most specific and appropriate match. The CWE description aligns perfectly with the vulnerability: "The code calls sizeof() on a pointer type, which can be an incorrect calculation if the programmer intended to determine the size of the data that is being pointed to."

The mapping guidance for CWE-467 is "Allowed" and the rationale states: "This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities."

Therefore, CWE-467 is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.

Other considered CWEs that were not selected:
* CWE-415 (Double Free): This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability does not involve calling `free()` twice on the same memory address.
* CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write): This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability does not involve writing data past the end of a buffer.
* CWE-457 (Use of Uninitialized Variable): This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability does not involve using a variable that has not been initialized.
* CWE-468 (Incorrect Pointer Scaling): While pointer issues are involved, the root cause is the incorrect usage of `sizeof()` rather than incorrect scaling.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-23975

## Vulnerability Description
The developer page aboutmemory has a Measure function for exploring what object types the browser has allocated and their sizes. When this function was invoked we incorrectly called the sizeof function, instead of using the API method that checks for invalid pointers. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 86.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **incorrect function call**
- **vector:** invalid pointers
- **product:** Firefox
- **version:** < 86
- **component:** developer page aboutmemory

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23975:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect usage of memory profiling code within the `about:memory` developer tool in Firefox. Specifically, the code directly called the `sizeof` function on a pointer without first validating if the pointer was valid.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect pointer handling: The code attempted to use `malloc_usable_size()` on a pointer that was not allocated through malloc, leading to an invalid memory access.
- Lack of proper validation: The `sizeof` function was called directly without checking the pointer's validity, resulting in a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: The primary impact of this vulnerability is a crash in Firefox when the `about:memory` "Measure" function is invoked.

**Attack Vectors:**
- User interaction: The vulnerability is triggered by a user navigating to `about:memory` and clicking the "Measure" button.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to access and interact with Firefox's user interface. No special privileges or remote access are needed, as it can be triggered by a user within their own browser session.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involved using the correct API that checks for invalid pointers before calling `sizeof`, thus preventing the crash.
- The vulnerability was classified as low severity and was fixed in Firefox 86 and later versions, and was not present in the ESR 78.x branch.
- The vulnerability was also fixed in Firefox Beta 86.
- This issue is not exploitable to execute code, but just leads to a crash of the browser.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-467: Use of sizeof() on a Pointer Type
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The code calls sizeof() on a pointer type, which can be an incorrect calculation if the programmer intended to determine the size of the data that is being pointed to.

### Extended Description
The use of sizeof() on a pointer can sometimes generate useful information. An obvious case is to find out the wordsize on a platform. More often than not, the appearance of sizeof(pointer) indicates a bug.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-131

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use






## CWE-415: Double Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.

### Extended Description
When a program calls free() twice with the same argument, the program's memory management data structures become corrupted. This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer. If malloc() returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.

### Alternative Terms
Double-free

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-825
ChildOf -> CWE-1341
ChildOf -> CWE-672
ChildOf -> CWE-672
ChildOf -> CWE-672
ChildOf -> CWE-666
PeerOf -> CWE-416
PeerOf -> CWE-123

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is usually resultant from another weakness, such as an unhandled error or race condition between threads. It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.

**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of "Use after Free", but "Use" and "Release" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately "Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release", which doesn't exist yet.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).
- **CVE-2004-0642:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.
- **CVE-2004-0772:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.




## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Memory Corruption: Often used to describe the consequences of writing to memory outside the bounds of a buffer, or to memory that is otherwise invalid.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.
- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results.

### Extended Description
In some languages such as C and C++, stack variables are not initialized by default. They generally contain junk data with the contents of stack memory before the function was invoked. An attacker can sometimes control or read these contents. In other languages or conditions, a variable that is not explicitly initialized can be given a default value that has security implications, depending on the logic of the program. The presence of an uninitialized variable can sometimes indicate a typographic error in the code.

### Alternative Terms
None

ChildOf -> CWE-665
ChildOf -> CWE-665

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2008-3688:** Chain: A denial of service may be caused by an uninitialized variable (CWE-457) allowing an infinite loop (CWE-835) resulting from a connection to an unresponsive server.
- **CVE-2008-0081:** Uninitialized variable leads to code execution in popular desktop application.




## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component
in another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the
intended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.

### Extended Description


When creating commands using interpolation into a string, developers may assume that only the arguments/options that they specify will be processed. This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences.


### Alternative Terms
