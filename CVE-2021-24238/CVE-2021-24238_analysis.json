This CWE is related to CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) through a ChildOf relationship. CWE-425 (Direct Request) is also related to CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) through a ChildOf relationship. Selecting CWE-639 is more specific than CWE-863.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe425,cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper authorization checks** when deleting properties. This leads to an **insecure direct object reference**, where an attacker can **tamper with the property_id parameter** to delete arbitrary properties. The final impact is **arbitrary property deletion** and potential data loss.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment points to an authorization issue where the system **fails to verify if the user requesting the property deletion is the owner of that property**. The provided evidence strongly supports this: \"The Realteo WordPress plugin before 1.2.4 ... did not ensure that the requested property to be deleted belong to the user making the request, allowing any authenticated users to delete arbitrary properties by tampering with the property_id parameter.\"\n\nThe retriever results and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary both suggest CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key). The description of CWE-639 aligns well with the vulnerability: \"The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\" The **property_id** parameter is the \"key value\" that the user controls, and the system **fails to verify authorization** based on this key.\n\nCWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) was considered because the attacker directly requests the deletion of a property by manipulating the `property_id` parameter. However, this is more of the attack vector than the root cause.\n\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization) was also considered but it is a more general class of weakness. CWE-639 is a more specific case of incorrect authorization.\n\nTherefore, CWE-639 is the most appropriate because it accurately describes the root cause where the system **fails to properly authorize the user based on the user-controlled key (property_id)**. This is at the optimal level of specificity because it focuses on the specific mechanism of authorization bypass through a user-controlled key.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
