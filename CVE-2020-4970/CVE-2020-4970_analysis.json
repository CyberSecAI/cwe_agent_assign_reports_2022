CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is a base class, but also related to CWE-614, which is a variant.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    cwe300[\"CWE-300: Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint\"]\n\n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n    cwe300 -->|CHILDOF| cwe923\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe614,cwe300 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)** which leads to the potential for **cleartext transmission of sensitive information**, which is then exploited using **man-in-the-middle techniques** and results in a remote attacker being able to **obtain sensitive information**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information). This is supported by the vulnerability description which states the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**. The vulnerability description key phrases highlight the **rootcause** as the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**, and the impact as the ability to **obtain sensitive information**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary identifies that the root cause stems from the non-enforcement of HSTS which allows attackers to intercept and manipulate network traffic, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nCWE-614 (Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute) was considered as a secondary candidate because HSTS often involves cookies and the secure attribute. However, there isn't sufficient evidence to confirm that cookies are the specific mechanism by which sensitive information is being transmitted in cleartext.\n\nCWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint) was considered, but the mapping guidance discourages its use and recommends focusing on the root cause. While a man-in-the-middle attack is the vector, the lack of HSTS is the root cause that enables it.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the core weakness of transmitting sensitive information in cleartext due to the absence of HSTS.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
