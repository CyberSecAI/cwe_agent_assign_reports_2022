## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the selection is the ChildOf relationship. CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). The chain relationship is not as relevant here, but it's important to note that missing authorization can lead to other vulnerabilities. The abstraction level played a crucial role; while CWE-285 is a higher-level class, CWE-862 is a more specific class that aligns better with the **missing permission check**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which allows attackers with `Overall/Read` permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs, leading to the capture of credentials stored in Jenkins.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis strongly suggested CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as the primary weakness, based on the **rootcause** being a **missing permission check**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions the plugin lacks proper access control, aligning perfectly with CWE-862. While other CWEs like CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) were considered due to the impact of capturing credentials, the root cause is the **missing authorization**. The relationship analysis further solidified this decision, as CWE-862 is a specific type of improper access control. The final decision is primarily based on the evidence that the product **does not perform an authorization check**.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2117:

**CVE-2020-2117: Missing permission check in Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin**

*   **Root Cause:** The Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin (versions 1.0.4 and earlier) does not perform permission checks on a method that implements form validation. This allows unauthorized users to access a functionality intended for administrative purposes.

*   **Weakness:** The plugin lacks proper access control, allowing users with `Overall/Read` permissions to call the form validation method, which should require a higher privilege level.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Attackers can connect to an attacker-specified URL by using attacker-specified credential IDs.
    *   This can lead to the capture of credentials stored in Jenkins.

*  **Attack Vector:** A user with Overall/Read access can trigger the vulnerable method to connect to an arbitrary URL by using arbitrary credentials IDs.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have `Overall/Read` access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   The attacker also needs to obtain valid credential IDs through another vulnerability (CVE-2020-2118).

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is part of a set of issues identified as `SECURITY-812 (1)`, which includes both CVE-2020-2116 (CSRF) and CVE-2020-2117 (missing permission check).
*   The fix for this issue is included in version 1.0.5 of the Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin.
*   The form validation method should require POST requests and Item/Configure permission, which is implemented in the fixed version.

## CWE-838: Inappropriate Encoding for Output Context
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses or specifies an encoding when generating output to a downstream component, but the specified encoding is not the same as the encoding that is expected by the downstream component.

### Extended Description


This weakness can cause the downstream component to use a decoding method that produces different data than what the product intended to send. When the wrong encoding is used - even if closely related - the downstream component could decode the data incorrectly. This can have security consequences when the provided boundaries between control and data are inadvertently broken, because the resulting data could introduce control characters or special elements that were not sent by the product. The resulting data could then be used to bypass protection mechanisms such as input validation, and enable injection attacks.


While using output encoding is essential for ensuring that communications between components are accurate, the use of the wrong encoding - even if closely related - could cause the downstream component to misinterpret the output.


For example, HTML entity encoding is used for elements in the HTML body of a web page. However, a programmer might use entity encoding when generating output for that is used within an attribute of an HTML tag, which could contain functional Javascript that is not affected by the HTML encoding.


While web applications have received the most attention for this problem, this weakness could potentially apply to any type of product that uses a communications stream that could support multiple encodings.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2009-2814:** Server does not properly handle requests that do not contain UTF-8 data; browser assumes UTF-8, allowing XSS.




## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information

- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.




## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

### Extended Description


Attackers at the destination may be able to spoof trusted servers to steal data or cause a denial of service.


There are at least two distinct weaknesses that can cause the product to communicate with an unintended destination:


  - If the product allows an attacker to control which destination is specified, then the attacker can cause it to connect to an untrusted or malicious destination. For example, because UDP is a connectionless protocol, UDP packets can be spoofed by specifying a false source address in the packet; when the server receives the packet and sends a reply, it will specify a destination by using the source of the incoming packet - i.e., the false source. The server can then be tricked into sending traffic to the wrong host, which is effective for hiding the real source of an attack and for conducting a distributed denial of service (DDoS). As another example, server-side request forgery (SSRF) and XML External Entity (XXE) can be used to trick a server into making outgoing requests to hosts that cannot be directly accessed by the attacker due to firewall restrictions.

  - If the product incorrectly specifies the destination, then an attacker who can control this destination might be able to spoof trusted servers. While the most common occurrence is likely due to misconfiguration by an administrator, this can be resultant from other weaknesses. For example, the product might incorrectly parse an e-mail or IP address and send sensitive data to an unintended destination. As another example, an Android application may use a "sticky broadcast" to communicate with a receiver for a particular application, but since sticky broadcasts can be processed by *any* receiver, this can allow a malicious application to access restricted data that was only intended for a different application.
