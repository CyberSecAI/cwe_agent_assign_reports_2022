CWE-400 is a class-level CWE, while CWE-770 is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-400. While ideally a base or variant CWE is preferred, the evidence more closely aligns with the broader scope of CWE-400.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a malicious user interacting with the user administration page, leading to a **resource consumption** issue that breaks the page and prevents administrators from managing users. The chain begins with the attacker's input and ends with a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the provided evidence, particularly the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which suggests that the vulnerability is related to **resource exhaustion or improper control of resources**. This pointed towards CWE-400. The retriever results also highlight CWE-400.\n\nThe decision to assign CWE-400 as the primary CWE is based on the evidence in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary and the impact of the vulnerability, which leads to a denial of service by breaking the user administration page. While the root cause is not explicitly detailed, the impact aligns well with the characteristics of CWE-400.\nCWE-770 is considered as the secondary CWE since it is a base CWE, and the description refers to Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling which seems related to the vulnerability. However, since root cause is not described it is difficult to make it the primary CWE.\n\nThe selection of CWE-400 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately represents the vulnerability's impact without requiring detailed knowledge of the underlying root cause. The evidence is not strong enough to pinpoint the exact resource that is exhausted or improperly controlled.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
