The primary CWE is CWE-326 Inadequate Encryption Strength, with a confidence of 1.0, since the description clearly states the encryption is theoretically sound but not strong enough for the required level of protection. The secondary CWE is CWE-331 Insufficient Entropy, which contributes to the weakness of the encryption. This mapping aligns with the MITRE guidance for both CWEs. Both CWEs are at appropriate levels of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\n*This CWE was considered but ultimately not selected because the vulnerability description indicates that the encryption algorithm itself is not broken, but rather that the implementation results in **inadequate encryption strength**. Therefore, CWE-326 is a more accurate fit.*\n\n## CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm or scheme that produces insufficient entropy, leaving patterns or clusters of values that are more likely to occur than others.\n*This CWE was selected as a secondary weakness because the inadequate encryption strength is partly due to the use of fields that are not sufficiently randomized.*\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n*This CWE was considered but not selected as the vulnerability is not due to weak credentials themselves, but rather the **inadequate encryption** of those credentials.*\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n*This CWE was considered but not selected as the summary says \"Undocumented Hard-coded Values\" are a potential weakness and not explicitly part of the main issue.*",
