However, those were not as specific as the **buffer underflow** described in the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe124[\"CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\"]\n    cwe786[\"CWE-786: Access of Memory Location Before Start of Buffer\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe124 -->|CHILDOF| cwe786\n    cwe124 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe124 primary\n    class cwe786,cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of a check for negative indices**, leading to a **buffer underflow**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the **vulnerability description key phrases** indicating a **buffer underflow** due to the **lack of checks for negative indices**. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"Possible **buffer underflow** due to lack of check for negative indices values when processing user provided input\". This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-124, which describes writing to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer. The retriever results also listed CWE-124 as the top candidate. Therefore, CWE-124 is at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
