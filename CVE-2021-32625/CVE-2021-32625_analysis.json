A potential outcome of an integer overflow is CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). CWE-190 is a base level weakness, while CWE-787 is also a base level weakness and a parent of CWE-124 (Buffer Underwrite) and CWE-120 (Classic Buffer Overflow). CWE-190 can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe190 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) in the `STRALGO LCS` command, which leads to heap corruption and potentially remote code execution.\n  - Root Cause: CWE-190 (**integer overflow**)\n  - Consequence: Heap corruption\n  - Impact: Potential remote code execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is an **integer overflow** in the `STRALGO LCS` command within Redis (CWE-190). The vulnerability description clearly states: \"An **integer overflow** bug in Redis version 6.0 or newer, could be exploited using the STRALGO LCS command to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this: \"Integer overflow in the `STRALGO LCS` command within Redis versions 6.0 and later.\" This directly matches the description of CWE-190, which involves a calculation that produces an integer overflow or wraparound.\n\nThe heap corruption is a consequence of the **integer overflow**, which can potentially lead to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). While remote code execution is the ultimate impact, the direct consequence of the overflow is heap corruption. Therefore, CWE-787 is considered a secondary weakness.\n\nThe graph relationships and retriever results support the selection of CWE-190 as the primary cause. The description and evidence support choosing CWE-190 as the optimal level of specificity, as it directly reflects the **root cause** described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
