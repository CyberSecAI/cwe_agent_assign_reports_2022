CWE-522 is a Class-level CWE with potential Base-level children that might be more appropriate, but none of the children were relevant. CWE-497 is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-200, providing a slightly more specific view of the information exposure. The abstraction levels influenced the selection, favoring the Class-level CWE-522 as the primary due to its direct relevance, while considering the Base-level CWE-497 as a secondary factor.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Inclusion of Sensitive Information in an Error Message\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe497 -->|ChildOf| cwe200\n    cwe522 -->|ChildOf| cwe1390\n    cwe522 -->|ChildOf| cwe287\n    cwe522 -->|ChildOf| cwe668\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe522 primary\n    class cwe497,cwe200,cwe1390,cwe287,cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **inclusion of sensitive information** within the installer, leading to potential access to this information by an unauthenticated local attacker who downloads and extracts the installer's contents.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the vulnerability description, highlighting the fact that **sensitive information is included in the application installer**. The provided CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirmed that the **root cause** of the vulnerability is the **inclusion of sensitive information** in the Cisco ThousandEyes Recorder application installer. The primary weakness identified was information disclosure, specifically CWE-522, **Insufficiently Protected Credentials**.\n\nThe retriever results also pointed to CWE-522 as the top candidate.\n\nThe final decision was to select CWE-522 as the primary CWE due to its direct relevance to the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions **sensitive information** included in the installer. CWE-497 was considered as a secondary CWE because it represents a more general form of information exposure.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
