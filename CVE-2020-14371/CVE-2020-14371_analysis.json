This relationship indicates that the vulnerability involves a specific case of exposing sensitive information. The CANFOLLOW relationship of CWE-201 with CWE-226 and CWE-212 suggests a potential chain where sensitive data is not properly removed before reuse or storage/transfer, leading to it being inserted into sent data.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe226[\"CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe201 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe226\n    cwe201 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe212\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe522 secondary\n    class cwe212,cwe226 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **credential leak** due to the **weakness** of exposing compute resource credentials through VMs running on these resources in Satellite. This leads to the insertion of sensitive information into sent data (CWE-201), resulting in the exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor (CWE-200). A possible prerequisite involves **insufficient protection of credentials** (CWE-522).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference, points to a **credential leak** in Red Hat Satellite. The key phrase \"credential leak\" and the summary indicating a \"Plaintext password (credential) leak via JSON\" strongly suggest that sensitive information is being exposed.\n\nThe Retriever Results list CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) and CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) as top candidates. CWE-201 aligns well with the vulnerability where compute resource credentials are being exposed through VMs. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **weakness** is a \"Plaintext password (credential) leak via JSON (CWE-200)\". However, the specific mechanism involves the insertion of this sensitive data into a data stream, making CWE-201 a more precise fit for the root cause.\n\nCWE-200 is considered but classified as a secondary candidate because it describes the impact of exposing sensitive information rather than the direct cause. The mapping guidance for CWE-200 discourages its use when a more specific CWE can be identified.\n\nCWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a possible contributing factor, if the credentials were not properly protected in the first place. However, the immediate cause is the insertion of the credentials into sent data, so CWE-522 is a secondary consideration.\n\nCWE-201 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **weakness** of inserting sensitive information into sent data, which leads to the **credential leak**. The supporting evidence from the CVE reference summary, specifically \"Plaintext password (credential) leak via JSON,\" confirms this assessment.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
