## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of symlinks** (CWE-59), which allows an attacker to use **relative path traversal** (CWE-23) to create directories outside the intended extraction directory.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The core issue is the **improper handling of symlinks** in the `tar` crate, which allows an attacker to create arbitrary directories via path traversal.

The vulnerability description states: "When symlinks are present in a TAR archive, extraction can create arbitrary directories via .. traversal."

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states:
*   "The vulnerability arises from how the `tar` crate handles symlinks during the unpacking process. Specifically, when a tar archive contains a symlink that points to a location outside the intended extraction directory (e.g., using ".."), the library creates the target directory structure *before* checking the validity of the path."
*   "**Path Traversal via Symlinks:** The core issue is the ability to use a symlink within the archive to force the creation of directories outside the intended target directory, leading to path traversal."

CWE-59, **Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')**, is the most accurate primary classification because it addresses the fundamental weakness of the `tar` crate not properly validating symlink targets.

CWE-23, **Relative Path Traversal**, and CWE-61, **UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following**, are secondary candidate classifications that capture specific details of the vulnerability.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-59 being a base-level weakness and CWE-23 and CWE-61 providing more context.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-38511

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in the tar crate before 0.4.36 for Rust. When symlinks are present in a TAR archive, extraction can create arbitrary directories via .. traversal.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** create arbitrary directories via .. traversal
- **product:** tar crate
- **version:** before 0.4.36

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability arises from how the `tar` crate handles symlinks during the unpacking process. Specifically, when a tar archive contains a symlink that points to a location outside the intended extraction directory (e.g., using ".."), the library creates the target directory structure *before* checking the validity of the path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Traversal via Symlinks:** The core issue is the ability to use a symlink within the archive to force the creation of directories outside the intended target directory, leading to path traversal.
*   **Premature Directory Creation:** The library creates the directory structure based on the path of the file *after* following the symlink, before verifying that the final path is within the target directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Directory Creation:** Attackers can create directories at locations that are not within the scope of the intended extraction path. While the vulnerable code errors when trying to write the file to a place outside the target directory, the directories themselves are left behind. This can be used in combination with another vulnerability to write to files outside the target directory.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While the provided content doesn't explicitly state a direct impact, creating arbitrary directories can be a crucial step in chaining vulnerabilities together. For example, an attacker might create a directory that will be targeted by another attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Tar Archive:** The attack vector involves a specially crafted tar archive that contains a symlink designed to point outside the expected extraction directory.
*   **Unpack Function (`tar::Archive::unpack`)**: The vulnerability is triggered when an application uses the vulnerable version of the `tar` crate's `unpack` function to extract a malicious archive.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Tar Archive:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a tar archive, injecting a malicious symlink.
*   **Control over Archive Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious archive to a system that uses the vulnerable `tar` crate for unpacking.
*   **No Special Privileges Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any special privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in `tar` version 0.4.36 and later.
*   The provided code snippet demonstrates a vulnerable tar archive that creates a symlink to `..` and then attempts to create a file in `symlink/exploit/foo/bar` to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The CVSS score is 7.5 (High), indicating a significant risk to system integrity.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
insecure temporary file: Some people use the phrase "insecure temporary file" when referring to a link following weakness, but other weaknesses can produce insecure temporary files without any symlink involvement at all.
Zip Slip: "Zip slip" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** 

Link following vulnerabilities are Multi-factor Vulnerabilities (MFV). They are the combination of multiple elements: file or directory permissions, filename predictability, race conditions, and in some cases, a design limitation in which there is no mechanism for performing atomic file creation operations.


Some potential factors are race conditions, permissions, and predictability.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.
- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.
- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.




## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following
**Abstraction:** Compound
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files.

### Extended Description
A product that allows UNIX symbolic links (symlink) as part of paths whether in internal code or through user input can allow an attacker to spoof the symbolic link and traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files. The symbolic link can permit an attacker to read/write/corrupt a file that they originally did not have permissions to access.

### Alternative Terms

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-59
Requires -> CWE-362
Requires -> CWE-340
Requires -> CWE-386
Requires -> CWE-732

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.
**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine which weaknesses allow symlink following to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable file names might be intended functionality, but creation in a directory with insecure permissions might not.
**Reasons:**
- Other


### Additional Notes
**[Research Gap]** 

Symlink vulnerabilities are regularly found in C and shell programs, but all programming languages can have this problem. Even shell programs are probably under-reported.


"Second-order symlink vulnerabilities" may exist in programs that invoke other programs that follow symlinks. They are rarely reported but are likely to be fairly common when process invocation is used [REF-493].

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description

### Extended Description
This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.

## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

### Extended Description


Many file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as ".." and "/" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the "../" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as "/usr/local/bin" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.


### Alternative Terms
Directory traversal
Path traversal: "Path traversal" is preferred over "directory traversal," but both terms are attack-focused.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-706
ChildOf -> CWE-706
ChildOf -> CWE-668

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add ".txt" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.

**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.

**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing "/" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).

**[Terminology]** 

Like other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use "directory traversal" only to refer to the injection of ".." and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.


Other variants like "absolute pathname" and "drive letter" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve ".." or equivalent.


**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.

**[Research Gap]** 

Incomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that "..\" is vulnerable, but not test "../" which may also be vulnerable.


Any combination of directory separators ("/", "\", etc.) and numbers of "." (e.g. "....") can produce unique variants; for example, the "//../" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama
- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the "\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)




## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

### Extended Description


Web servers, FTP servers, and similar servers may store a set of files underneath a "root" directory that is accessible to the server's users. Applications may store sensitive files underneath this root without also using access control to limit which users may request those files, if any. Alternately, an application might package multiple files or directories into an archive file (e.g., ZIP or tar), but the application might not exclude sensitive files that are underneath those directories.


In cloud technologies and containers, this weakness might present itself in the form of misconfigured storage accounts that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.

### Extended Description


This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.


The "../" manipulation is the canonical manipulation for operating systems that use "/" as directory separators, such as UNIX- and Linux-based systems.
