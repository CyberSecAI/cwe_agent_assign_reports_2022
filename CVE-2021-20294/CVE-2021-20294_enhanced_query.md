# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-20294

# Vulnerability Description

    A flaw was found in binutils readelf 2.35 program. An attacker who is able to convince a victim using readelf to read a crafted file could trigger a **stack buffer overflow**, **out-of-bounds write** of arbitrary data supplied by the attacker. The highest impact of this flaw is to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

    ## WEAKNESS: 'stack buffer overflow'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 438.84)

A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function)....

### 2. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Score: 435.73)

The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 3. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 422.10)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 4. CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write (Score: 407.16)

The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 5. CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (Score: 405.08)

The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data....
