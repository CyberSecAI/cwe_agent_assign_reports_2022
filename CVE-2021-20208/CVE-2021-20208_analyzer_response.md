# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2021-20208

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-266 | Incorrect Privilege Assignment | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced my decision was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-201 and CWE-200. Although CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and generally discouraged, CWE-201 offers a more specific Base-level classification for the insertion of sensitive information. CWE-266 was a better fit than CWE-732 due to it being an assignment weakness as opposed to permissions not being properly checked.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the container using the host's Kerberos credentials, leading to unauthorized access to SMB resources, and finally compromising data confidentiality and integrity.

*   **Root Cause:** **Incorrect Privilege Assignment** (CWE-266) - The cifs-utils **incorrectly assigns** the privilege of using the host's Kerberos credentials to processes within a container.
*   **Weakness:** **Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data** (CWE-201) - The Kerberos credentials are inadvertently used to authenticate from within the container which compromises confidentiality.
*   **Impact:** Data Confidentiality and Integrity Compromise - A compromised container accesses SMB resources using the host's Kerberos credentials, leading to unauthorized data access or modification.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis concludes that the primary weakness is **Incorrect Privilege Assignment** (CWE-266), where the container gains unauthorized access to the host's Kerberos credentials. This is supported by the vulnerability description, which states that a user within a container can use Kerberos credentials of the host. The secondary weakness is **Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data** (CWE-201) as the Kerberos credentials are sent as part of the authentication process, representing a loss of confidentiality. CWE-200 is a more general case of this.

The provided evidence explicitly mentions the vulnerability's root cause and impact, strengthening the confidence in this assessment.

The selection of CWE-266 and CWE-201 is at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-266 accurately captures the root cause where the privilege is incorrectly assigned and CWE-201 captures the exfiltration of the credentials in the authentication process.

# Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.

## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 7877.45
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in
