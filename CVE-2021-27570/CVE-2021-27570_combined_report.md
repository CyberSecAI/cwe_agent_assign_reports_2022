```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** (**ROOTCAUSE**), which allows attackers to send specially crafted packets to close any running process. The process name is transmitted in cleartext, which makes it easier for attackers to identify and target specific processes.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary vulnerability is the **lack of authentication** for the critical function of closing processes, which is well-represented by CWE-306. This allows attackers to close any running process by sending a specially crafted packet. The fact that the process name is transmitted in cleartext (CWE-319) is a secondary weakness that facilitates the attack, but the core issue is the **missing authentication**.

The selection of CWE-306 and CWE-319 is based on the following evidence:

*   Vulnerability Description: "Attackers can close any running process by sending the process name in a specially crafted packet. This information is sent in cleartext and is not protected by any authentication logic."
*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: "**Missing Authentication:** The application does not verify the source of the close process command, or validate the user's authority." and "**Cleartext Transmission:** The process name is transmitted in cleartext within the UDP packet."

CWE-306 and CWE-319 are at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level for mapping root causes of vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in Emote Remote Mouse through 3.015. Attackers can close any running process by sending the process name in a specially crafted packet. This information is sent in cleartext and is not protected by any authentication logic.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** close any running process
- **vector:** specially crafted packet
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** Emote Remote Mouse
- **version:** through 3.015

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27570:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of authentication and authorization when handling specially crafted packets containing process names. The Remote Mouse application allows closing of any running process without any authentication or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The application does not verify the source of the close process command, or validate the user's authority.
- **Cleartext Transmission:** The process name is transmitted in cleartext within the UDP packet.
- **Lack of Authorization:** The server allows any remote attacker to close any running process with a crafted packet, without any authentication or authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can remotely close any running application, causing disruption and preventing the user from using the application.
- **Data Loss:** In cases where users are relying on an application, abruptly closing the application may cause the loss of unsaved data.
- **System Instability**: Repeatedly closing core system processes may make the system unstable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is carried out by sending specially crafted UDP packets over the network to port 1979 of the targeted device running the Remote Mouse server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the target or have network connectivity to the target's device.
- **Packet Crafting:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and send custom UDP packets.
- **Knowledge of Target Process:** The attacker needs to know the name of the process they wish to close.

**Additional Details (From the provided content):**
- **Affected Versions:** Emote Remote Mouse through version 3.015.
- **Exploitability:** The exploit is easily achievable, as the vulnerability does not require any complex exploitation techniques. The attacker simply needs to construct a UDP packet with a `clo` command, the length of the process name, and the process name.
- **Lack of Fix:** The vendor released an update to version `4.0.0.0` but did not patch any of the listed security vulnerabilities.
- **No Password Protection:** This vulnerability exists on the server regardless of whether the password feature is enabled
- **Port:** This vulnerability is exposed over port 1979 via UDP

This information goes beyond the basic description in a standard CVE entry, providing a full picture of how the vulnerability works and how it can be exploited.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry has some significant overlap with other CWE entries and may need some clarification. See terminology notes.

**[Terminology]** The "Origin Validation Error" term was originally used in a 1995 thesis [REF-324]. Although not formally defined, an issue is considered to be an origin validation error if either (1) "an object [accepts] input from an unauthorized subject," or (2) "the system [fails] to properly or completely authenticate a subject." A later section says that an origin validation error can occur when the system (1) "does not properly authenticate a user or process" or (2) "does not properly authenticate the shared data or libraries." The only example provided in the thesis (covered by OSVDB:57615) involves a setuid program running command-line arguments without dropping privileges. So, this definition (and its examples in the thesis) effectively cover other weaknesses such as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), and CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges). There appears to be little usage of this term today, except in the SecurityFocus vulnerability database, where the term is used for a variety of issues, including web-browser problems that allow violation of the Same Origin Policy and improper validation of the source of an incoming message.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2000-1218:** DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning
- **CVE-2005-0877:** DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning
- **CVE-2001-1452:** DNS server caches glue records received from non-delegated name servers




## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

### Extended Description


While assertion is good for catching logic errors and reducing the chances of reaching more serious vulnerability conditions, it can still lead to a denial of service.


For example, if a server handles multiple simultaneous connections, and an assert() occurs in one single connection that causes all other connections to be dropped, this is a reachable assertion that leads to a denial of service.


### Alternative Terms
assertion failure

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

Multiple interpretation errors can indirectly introduce inputs that should be disallowed. For example, a list of dangerous shell metacharacters might not include a metacharacter that only has meaning in one particular shell, not all of them; or a check for XSS manipulations might ignore an unusual construct that is supported by one web browser, but not others.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the "\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.
- **CVE-2008-2309:** product uses a denylist to identify potentially dangerous content, allowing attacker to bypass a warning

## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.
