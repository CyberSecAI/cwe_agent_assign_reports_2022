# Analysis for CVE-2021-46390

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-807 | Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-807, describes the core issue where the system trusts an input (the authentication result) that can be manipulated by an untrusted actor (the attacker). While CWE-287 "Improper Authentication" is a parent of CWE-306 "Missing Authentication for Critical Function" and was considered, it is too general. CWE-306, as a child of CWE-287, more closely aligns by focusing on the absence of authentication for a critical function, which in this case is allowing access to sensitive data after bypassing authentication. The relationship between CWE-807 and CWE-287 is less direct, as CWE-807 describes the mechanism by which the improper authentication is achieved, making it the more precise root cause.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain starts with **an access control issue in the authentication module** allowing the attacker to manipulate the authentication result. This leads to **bypassing user authentication** and accessing **sensitive data**, which results in a **Denial of Service (DoS)**.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, points to an **access control issue** that allows manipulation of the authentication result. The FingerTool_Lexar software relies on a return value in a register to determine authentication success. An attacker can modify this value to bypass authentication, gain unauthorized access to encrypted data, and obtain administrator privileges.

The primary CWE identified is CWE-807, "Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision." This is justified by the fact that the software relies on the authentication result, an input that can be modified by the attacker. The vulnerability description explicitly states that "an attacker can bypass password authentication by analyzing the functions that return the password verification or comparison results and manipulate the authentication result values." This aligns perfectly with CWE-807.

CWE-306, "Missing Authentication for Critical Function," is a secondary consideration. While the vulnerability does result in a bypass of authentication, the root cause is not the *absence* of authentication, but rather the *insecure reliance* on a manipulatable authentication result. The system attempts authentication, but the mechanism is flawed due to the reliance on an untrusted input. Therefore, CWE-807 more accurately reflects the core weakness.

The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-807 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred, and accurately describes the vulnerability.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-46390

## Vulnerability Description
An access control issue in the authentication module of Lexar_F35 v1.0.34 allows attackers to access sensitive data and cause a Denial of Service (DoS). An attacker without access to securely protected data on a secure USB flash drive can bypass user authentication without having any information related to the password of the registered user. The secure USB flash drive transmits the password entered by the user to the authentication module in the drive after the user registers a password, and then the input password is compared with the registered password stored in the authentication module. Subsequently, the module returns the comparison result for the authentication decision. Therefore, an attacker can bypass password authentication by analyzing the functions that return the password verification or comparison results and manipulate the authentication result values. Accordingly, even if attackers enter an incorrect password, they can be authenticated as a legitimate user and can therefore exploit functions of the secure USB flash drive by manipulating the authentication result values.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **access control issue in authentication module**
- **impact:** access sensitive data and cause a Denial of Service (DoS)
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** Lexar_F35
- **version:** v1.0.34
- **component:** authentication module

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure implementation of password authentication in the FingerTool_Lexar software, specifically how it handles and verifies the authentication results received from the Lexar F35 USB drive. The software relies on a manipulatable return value to determine authentication success.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure Authentication Result Handling:** The password verification function within the management program directly exposes the authentication result. This result, returned by the function, is a value in a register, and can be modified.
2. **Lack of Input Validation:** The management program does not validate the result of the authentication function. It assumes the value is correct and uses the returned value directly to determine if the user has correctly authenticated, making it susceptible to manipulation.
3. **Reliance on a Single Register for Authentication:** The authentication success/failure relies solely on the value within the EAX register. This makes it a single point of failure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass password authentication on the Lexar F35 USB drive.
2.  **Data Theft:** By bypassing authentication, attackers can access and steal data stored on the secure USB flash drive, even if the data is encrypted.
3.  **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation grants administrator privileges to the attacker, enabling further malicious actions, such as adding/deleting users and modifying the system.
4.  **Unencrypted Data Exposure:** When an attacker bypasses the password, data encrypted on the USB drive is automatically decrypted, making it accessible to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker needs physical access to the Lexar F35 USB drive and a Windows system to run the management program (FingerTool_Lexar).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Physical access:** The attacker needs to have physical possession of the Lexar F35 USB drive.
2.  **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of reverse engineering, debugging, and memory manipulation to identify the vulnerable code and manipulate the return value. They would need to understand how `DeviceIoControl()` works and how authentication results are processed.
3.  **Software Access:** Requires the vulnerable FingerTool_Lexar software to be installed and running on the system.
4. **Low Privilege:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a user with low privileges on the local machine.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the password authentication process, not the fingerprint authentication.
*   The provided analysis includes a detailed reverse engineering of the `DeviceIoControl` function calls, which is more in-depth than a typical CVE description. The report demonstrates how the attacker identified the authentication result within the EAX register by providing specific register values.
*   The attacker modifies the return value of the password verification function to bypass authentication.

In summary, the vulnerability lies in the insecure way the FingerTool_Lexar management program handles the authentication result, which is exposed and can be easily manipulated. This allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the encrypted data on the USB and obtain administrator privileges.

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

### Extended Description


There are two main variations:


  - Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials. In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.

  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.

## CWE-1191: On-Chip Debug and Test Interface With Improper Access Control
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The chip does not implement or does not correctly perform access control to check whether users are authorized to access internal registers and test modes through the physical debug/test interface.

### Extended Description


A device's internal information may be accessed through a scan chain of interconnected internal registers, usually through a JTAG interface. The JTAG interface provides access to these registers in a serial fashion in the form of a scan chain for the purposes of debugging programs running on a device. Since almost all information contained within a device may be accessed over this interface, device manufacturers typically insert some form of authentication and authorization to prevent unintended use of this sensitive information. This mechanism is implemented in addition to on-chip protections that are already present.


If authorization, authentication, or some other form of access control is not implemented or not implemented correctly, a user may be able to bypass on-chip protection mechanisms through the debug interface.


Sometimes, designers choose not to expose the debug pins on the motherboard. Instead, they choose to hide these pins in the intermediate layers of the board. This is primarily done to work around the lack of debug authorization inside the chip. In such a scenario (without debug authorization), when the debug interface is exposed, chip internals are accessible to an attacker.


### Alternative Terms

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** CWE-1191 and CWE-1244 both involve physical debug access, but the weaknesses are different. CWE-1191 is effectively about missing authorization for a debug interface, i.e. JTAG. CWE-1244 is about providing internal assets with the wrong debug access level, exposing the asset to untrusted debug agents.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-18827:** chain: JTAG interface is not disabled (CWE-1191) during ROM code execution, introducing a race condition (CWE-362) to extract encryption keys




## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
**Abstraction:** Base

### Extended Description
Not provided

**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.






## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.

These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30273:** SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity
- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.
- **CVE-2008-3775:** Product uses "ROT-25" to obfuscate the password in the registry.




## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

### Extended Description


Many password storage mechanisms compute a hash and store the hash, instead of storing the original password in plaintext. In this design, authentication involves accepting an incoming password, computing its hash, and comparing it to the stored hash.


Many hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. However, this efficiency is a problem for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker's workload for brute-force password cracking. If an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method (such as SQL injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by computing hashes efficiently. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing (such as cloud computing) and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware. In such a scenario, an efficient hash algorithm helps the attacker.


There are several properties of a hash scheme that are relevant to its strength against an offline, massively-parallel attack:


  - The amount of CPU time required to compute the hash ("stretching")

  - The amount of memory required to compute the hash ("memory-hard" operations)

  - Including a random value, along with the password, as input to the hash computation ("salting")

  - Given a hash, there is no known way of determining an input (e.g., a password) that produces this hash value, other than by guessing possible inputs ("one-way" hashing)

  - Relative to the number of all possible hashes that can be generated by the scheme, there is a low likelihood of producing the same hash for multiple different inputs ("collision resistance")

Note that the security requirements for the product may vary depending on the environment and the value of the passwords. Different schemes might not provide all of these properties, yet may still provide sufficient security for the environment. Conversely, a solution might be very strong in preserving one property, which still being very weak for an attack against another property, or it might not be able to significantly reduce the efficiency of a massively-parallel attack.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2008-1526:** Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.
- **CVE-2006-1058:** Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.
- **CVE-2008-4905:** Blogging software uses a hard-coded salt when calculating a password hash.




## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
