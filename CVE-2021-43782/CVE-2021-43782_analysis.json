CWE-90 is a base level CWE which makes it ideal for mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe90[\"CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in a Command\"]\n\n    cwe90 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe90 primary\n    class cwe943 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input sanitization** of the `ldap_id` attribute, leading to **LDAP Injection**, which allows a malicious user to force account suspension or takeover.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" and \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\".\n\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states:\n- \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by Tuleap not properly sanitizing the search filter built from the `ldap_id` attribute of a user during the daily synchronization process. This occurs when checking if the user still exists in the LDAP directory.\"\n- \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** - **LDAP Injection:** The primary weakness is an indirect LDAP injection vulnerability. The `ldap_id` attribute is not properly escaped, allowing a malicious user to inject arbitrary LDAP queries. - **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-controlled input (`ldap_id`) before using it in an LDAP search filter.\"\n\nThe \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" states:\n- \"**rootcause:** **improper input sanitization**\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by confirming that CWE-90 is a base level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-90 is selected because it accurately represents the vulnerability where **improper sanitization** of the `ldap_id` attribute allows for **LDAP injection**. The CWE description matches the vulnerability description: \"The product constructs all or part of an LDAP query using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended LDAP query when it is sent to a downstream component.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\nThis CWE was not selected because the core issue isn't the reliance on untrusted inputs for a security decision, but the **lack of proper sanitization** leading to **LDAP injection**.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\nThis CWE was not selected because it's a class-level CWE and CWE-90 is more specific to the **LDAP injection** vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\nThis CWE was not selected as the vulnerability is not related to the incorrect implementation of an authentication algorithm.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\nThis CWE was not selected as the vulnerability is not directly related to authorization bypass through user-controlled keys but more on **improper sanitization** leading to **LDAP injection**.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\nThis CWE was not selected as the vulnerability is not about externally controllable immutable web parameters, but **improper sanitization** of `ldap_id`.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\nThis CWE was not selected as the vulnerability is not directly related to weak authentication mechanisms.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\nThis CWE was not selected because the issue isn't an incomplete list of disallowed inputs, but **improper sanitization** of the `ldap_id` attribute.\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\nThis CWE was not selected because the vulnerability doesn't involve observable response discrepancies.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\nThis CWE was not selected because this CWE is high-level and CWE-90 is more specific to the **LDAP injection** vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\nThis CWE was not selected because the vulnerability is not related to cleartext transmission of sensitive information.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\nThis CWE was not selected because the root cause is **improper sanitization** leading to **LDAP injection**, and the authorization issue is a consequence of that.\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\nThis CWE was not selected as the root cause is **improper sanitization** leading to **LDAP injection**.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\nWhile encoding/escaping is related to sanitization, CWE-90 is more specific to the **LDAP injection** context.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\nThis CWE was not selected because the vulnerability is specific to **LDAP injection**, not XSS.\n\n## CWE-386: Symbolic Name not Mapping to Correct Object\nThis CWE was not selected as it does not apply to this vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check\nThis CWE was not selected as it does not apply to this vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\nThis CWE was not selected as it does not apply to this vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\nThis CWE was not selected as it does not apply to this vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity\nThis CWE was not selected as it does not apply to this vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\nThis CWE was not selected as it does not apply to this vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\nThis CWE was not selected as it does not apply to this vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\nThis CWE was not selected because it is not relevant to the described vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\nThis CWE was not selected because it is not relevant to the described vulnerability.",
