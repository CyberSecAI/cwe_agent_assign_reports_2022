This means that CWE-787 is a more specific type of memory buffer error. The retriever results also suggest CWE-416, but the vulnerability description focused on **memory corruption**, and the **memory safety bugs**, which makes CWE-787, **Out-of-bounds Write**, a better fit than CWE-416 **Use-After-Free**, because the description speaks to the action of writing out of bounds.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a **memory safety bug** that leads to **memory corruption**. The **memory corruption** can then be exploited to run arbitrary code.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, driven by the vulnerability description's emphasis on **memory safety bugs** and **memory corruption**, strongly suggests CWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write** as the primary CWE. The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" confirms this as the Primary CWE Match. The description states that the Mozilla developers reported **memory safety bugs** and \"**Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption**\". This statement makes CWE-787 a strong candidate as an **out-of-bounds write** is a common cause of **memory corruption**.\n\nThe graph relationships, particularly the child-of relationship between CWE-787 and CWE-119, further influenced the final selection. While CWE-119 is a broader category, the specific evidence of **memory corruption** supports the more specific CWE-787.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-787 directly addresses the **out-of-bounds write** condition, which is the root cause of the **memory corruption**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
