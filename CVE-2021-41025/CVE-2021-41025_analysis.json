CWE-362 is a Class-level CWE, and the description aligns well with the vulnerability description. The secondary relationship is the authentication bypass due to capture-replay, which is a more specific instance of authentication issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe294[\"CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe362 -->|ChildOf| cwe691[\"CWE-691: Incomplete Processing of Multi-Staged Transaction\"]\n    cwe294 -->|PeerOf| cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe294 -->|ChildOf| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe294 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **concurrent execution using shared resource with improper synchronization** (CWE-362), leading to an authentication bypass by capture-replay. The improper synchronization allows an attacker to interfere with the authentication process, eventually leading to a successful bypass.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-362 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of **concurrent execution using shared resource with improper synchronization** in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference. Additionally, authentication bypass by capture-replay is also mentioned.\n\nThe final assessment confirms CWE-362 as the primary CWE due to the **root cause** being the race condition. The secondary CWE is CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay, as stated in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which is a direct consequence of the authentication mechanism weaknesses.\n\nThe selection of CWE-362 is at the Class level of abstraction, which is appropriate given the information available. While more specific Base-level CWEs could potentially exist, there is not enough information to justify a more specific mapping.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe

Selection\n\n### CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n*   **Match:** The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **\"concurrent execution using shared resource with improper synchronization.\"** This directly aligns with the CWE's description of a race condition where a timing window exists for a shared resource to be modified concurrently.\n*   **Implication:** This weakness can allow an attacker to manipulate the authentication process by exploiting the race condition, potentially bypassing security measures.\n*   **Relationship:** CWE-362 is a Class-level CWE.\n*   **Guidance:** The MITRE mapping guidance suggests reviewing children of this entry for a better fit, but given the explicit mention of the race condition, CWE-362 is deemed appropriate.\n*   **Primary/Secondary:** Primary\n\n### CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n*   **Match:** The vulnerability description mentions \"authentication bypass by capture-replay.\" This directly aligns with the concept of capturing and replaying authentication data to circumvent the authentication process.\n*   **Implication:** An attacker can capture valid authentication data and reuse it to gain unauthorized access, bypassing the intended authentication mechanism.\n*   **Relationship:** CWE-294 is related to authentication issues and can be seen as a specific type of authentication bypass.\n*   **Guidance:** The MITRE mapping guidance doesn't directly address CWE-294 in this context, but it aligns with the general principles of identifying the most specific CWE.\n*   **Primary/Secondary:** Secondary\n\n### Considered but Not Used\n\n*   **CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function:** While the vulnerability leads to authentication bypass, the **root cause** is the race condition (CWE-362) and the capture-replay (CWE-294) rather than a complete lack of authentication.\n*   **CWE-287: Improper Authentication:** This is a broader category, and CWE-294 is more specific to the vulnerability.\n*   **CWE-285: Improper Authorization:** This is not directly related since the issue is about bypassing authentication, not about lacking authorization after authentication.\n*   **CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal:** This is not relevant to the vulnerability description.\n*   **CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel:** This is a valid candidate, however, the exploit is due to capture-replay rather than an alternate path.\n*   **CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration:** This is not relevant to the vulnerability description.\n*   **CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere:** This is too broad and doesn't accurately describe the specific weakness.\n*
