Since the vulnerability specifically describes a memory leak, CWE-401, a variant of CWE-772, is the more specific and appropriate choice. CWE-404 is a parent of CWE-401 and CWE-772 and was also considered.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe772[\"CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    \n    cwe401 -->|CHILDOF| cwe772\n    cwe772 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    cwe401 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe401 primary\n    class cwe772,cwe404 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **memory leak** in the `unix_stream_recvmsg` function due to **improper resource management**, specifically the failure to call `scm_destroy(&scm)` when a signal interrupts the loop. This leads to memory exhaustion, ultimately causing the system to crash (Denial of Service).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states: \"The core **weakness** is **improper resource management**, specifically a **missing** `scm_destroy(&scm)` call when a signal interrupts the `unix_stream_recvmsg` loop\" and \"Memory leak due to not freeing the socket control message (`scm`) structure in the `unix_stream_recvmsg` function when interrupted by a signal.\" The **weakness** is a **memory leak**, and the root cause is a **missing** resource release.\n\nThe retriever results strongly support CWE-401 as the primary candidate. The graph relationships also support this selection, as it is a child of the more general CWE-772 (Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime). CWE-401 is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is preferred, and directly addresses the specific memory leak issue. CWE-772 and CWE-404 were considered as parent classes, but the more specific CWE-401 was ultimately chosen.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis is often triggered by improper handling of malformed data or unexpectedly interrupted sessions.
