CWE-927 is also a variant of CWE-285, suggesting a peer relationship where both CWEs represent different ways authorization can be mishandled in Android. CWE-601 is not directly related to the authorization hierarchy but is a base-level CWE that deals with redirection vulnerabilities, which could potentially be linked to intent redirection in some scenarios. The selection favored the more specific variant, CWE-926, as the primary mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe926[\"CWE-926: Improper Export of Android Application Components\"]\n    cwe927[\"CWE-927: Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication\"]\n    cwe601[\"CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe926 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe927 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe926 primary\n    class cwe927,cwe601 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper export** of an Android application component (CWE-926). This **weakness** allows for **intent redirection**, which then leads to the **impact** of an attacker gaining unauthorized access to contact information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and retriever results, pointed to CWE-926 (Improper Export of Android Application Components) as the primary candidate. The description explicitly mentions **\"intent redirection\"** as the root cause, and the retriever results listed CWE-926 as the top combined result.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is strong:\n\n*   The vulnerability description states **\"Intent redirection vulnerability in Group Sharing prior to 10.8.03.2 allows attacker to access contact information.\"**\n*   The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating **\"Root cause of vulnerability: Intent redirection vulnerability.\"** and **\"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The Group Sharing application prior to version 10.8.03.2 is vulnerable to intent redirection.\"**\n\nThe relationship analysis further reinforces this choice, as CWE-926 is a variant of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), indicating that the **improper export** is a specific case of a broader authorization issue.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but ultimately not chosen as the primary mapping:\n\n*   CWE-927 (Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication) was considered due to its relevance to Android intent vulnerabilities. However, the description focuses on **improper export** rather than the use of implicit intents.\n*   CWE-601 (URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')) was considered because of the mention of \"intent redirection.\" However, this CWE is more applicable to web applications, and the vulnerability description is specific to an Android application.\n\nThe selection of CWE-926 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause (**improper export** of an Android component leading to **intent redirection**), while also being a variant that provides sufficient detail for understanding the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level",
