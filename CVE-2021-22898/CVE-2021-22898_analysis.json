CWE-457 is also related to CWE-456 Missing Initialization of a Variable. The secondary CWE is CWE-253 Incorrect Check of Function Return Value.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe457[\"CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable\"]\n    cwe908[\"CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\"]\n    cwe909[\"CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\"]\n    cwe456[\"CWE-456: Missing Initialization of a Variable\"]\n    cwe253[\"CWE-253: Incorrect Check of Function Return Value\"]\n\n    cwe457 -->|CHILDOF| cwe908\n    cwe457 -->|CHILDOF| cwe909\n    cwe457 -->|PEEROF| cwe456\n    cwe456 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe457\n    cwe457 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe253\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe457 primary\n    class cwe253 secondary\n    class cwe908,cwe909,cwe456 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect handling of the sscanf return code**, which leads to the **use of an uninitialized stack-based buffer**, and finally results in **information disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **use of uninitialized data from a stack based buffer**. This aligns with CWE-457 (Use of Uninitialized Variable), which is a Variant-level CWE. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states the root_cause is \"libcurl could be made to pass on **uninitialized data from a stack based buffer** to the server\". This confirms that the uninitialized data is being used, which is the key characteristic of CWE-457.\n\nThe analysis also found that \"curl did not check the return code from a sscanf() function invoke correctly.\" This aligns with CWE-253 (Incorrect Check of Function Return Value). The retriever results show that the top combined result is CWE-253 with a score of 0.861.\n\nI am selecting CWE-457 as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description and CVE summary both explicitly mention **uninitialized data from a stack based buffer**. The retriever results show CWE-457 with a good score. The Complete CWE Specifications lists the Usage as Allowed with the Rationale: \"This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\"\n\nI am selecting CWE-253 as a secondary CWE because the CVE summary indicates that an sscanf() function return code was not checked correctly. The retriever results show CWE-253 as the top combined result.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage:

CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 5342.62\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe
