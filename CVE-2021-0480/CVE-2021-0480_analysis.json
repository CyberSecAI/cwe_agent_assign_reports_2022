CWE-927 is a variant that specializes in the context of Android implicit intents, making it more specific than its parent. While CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is also a parent, it is too broad.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe927[\"CWE-927: Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe927 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe927 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe927 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **sensitive information in broadcast intent**. This leads to a local information disclosure. The use of an implicit intent is the root cause that allows the sensitive information to be exposed.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **sensitive information in broadcast intent**. The Retriever Results highlighted CWE-927 (Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication) as a strong candidate. The vulnerability description states \"In createPendingIntent of SnoozeHelper.java, there is a possible broadcast intent containing a sensitive identifier. This could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed.\" This statement, combined with the \"Root Cause:\" section in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary (\"The lack of specific details points to an issue in the core logic of snoozing alarm functionality or related permission checks.\"), supports the selection of CWE-927 as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-927 is chosen because the vulnerability involves a broadcast intent containing sensitive data in an Android application. An implicit intent does not specify the application to receive the data, allowing any application to process it.\n\nI also considered CWE-223 (Omission of Security-relevant Information) because it is possible that security-relevant information like the source of the intent is omitted, but it seems secondary to the primary issue of using an implicit intent for sensitive data.\n\nThe confidence in the assessment is 0.7 because while the evidence strongly suggests CWE-927, the exact mechanism of information disclosure is not fully detailed.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-248: Uncaught Exception\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn exception is thrown from a function, but it is not caught.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
