CWE-639, Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key, is a peer of CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). The choice of CWE-287 is at the Class level because the description indicates a fundamental flaw in authentication rather than a specific implementation error. CWE-639 is chosen to indicate the user-controlled key aspect, and CWE-359 is included because of the potential to expose personal information during the **account takeover**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe639,cwe359 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses starts with an **improper authentication** mechanism that allows new user registrations to access existing accounts. This leads to an **authorization bypass** where users can access resources they shouldn't, and potentially results in **exposure of private personal information**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered several CWEs, including CWE-303 (Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm), CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). However, the root cause is more accurately described as a general **Improper Authentication** issue, as the vulnerability allows new user registrations to access anyones account. This is supported by the vulnerability description mentioning that new user registrations are able to access anyone's account by only knowing their basic profile information.\n\nThe selection of CWE-287 is at the Class level due to the general nature of the **authentication weakness**. The inclusion of CWE-639 highlights the specific mechanism of bypassing authorization using user-controlled information. Finally, CWE-359 is chosen to represent the potential impact of exposing private personal information. The evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" clearly points to an **account takeover** vulnerability, which aligns with **improper authentication**.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
