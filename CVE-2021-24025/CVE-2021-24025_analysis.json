The vulnerability description states that **incorrect string size calculations** can lead to an **integer overflow**. This overflow then causes a heap overflow, which is **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)**, a Variant-level CWE and a child of **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)**. We also considered that the root cause started with an **incorrect string size calculations** which can be classified as **CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size)**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe122\n    cwe131 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe190\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe122,cwe131 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size)** leading to **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)**, which then results in **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)**. The root cause is the **incorrect size calculation**, and the impact is the **heap overflow**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)** as a strong candidate due to the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning an **integer overflow**. The description also mentions that the **integer overflow** leads to a heap overflow, making **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)** another relevant candidate.\n\nThe chain of events starts with the **incorrect string size calculations** inside the `preg_quote` function, a **large input string** passed to the function can trigger an **integer overflow** leading to a heap overflow. The **incorrect string size calculations** suggests **CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size)**.\n\nThe final selection includes **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)** as the primary CWE, representing the **integer overflow** vulnerability. **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)** is selected as a secondary CWE, representing the resulting heap overflow. **CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size)** is a third CWE to represent how the buffer size was calculated in the first place. These CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity, with **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)** being a Base CWE and **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)** being a Variant CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
