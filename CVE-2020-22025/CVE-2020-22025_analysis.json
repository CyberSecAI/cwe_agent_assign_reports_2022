This indicates a clear hierarchical relationship, with CWE-122 being the most specific and appropriate choice given the vulnerability details. The relationships between CWE-119, CWE-122 and CWE-787 guided the selection of CWE-122 as the primary weakness. CWE-119 is too general, and while CWE-787 is more specific, CWE-122 directly identifies the heap-based nature of the buffer overflow.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: A **heap-based buffer overflow** (CWE-122) occurs due to an unspecified error in the `gaussian_blur` function, leading to memory corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-122 as the most appropriate mapping due to the explicit mention of a \"heap-based buffer overflow\" in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary: \"**weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**\" and \"A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the `gaussian_blur` function\". The ASAN log in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides additional context by showing the exact location of memory corruption.\n\nThe retriever results also pointed to CWE-119 and CWE-190, but CWE-119 is too generic (\"Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"). CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) is not directly supported by the provided information, as there is no mention of integer overflow issues. The description and supporting details specifically indicated a heap-based buffer overflow, making CWE-122 the most accurate and specific choice. The relationship analysis reinforced this selection, as CWE-122 is a variant (more specific type) of CWE-787, which in turn is a child of CWE-119.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
