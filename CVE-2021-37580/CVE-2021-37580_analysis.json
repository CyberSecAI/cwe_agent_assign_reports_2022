CWE-287 is a class-level CWE, while CWE-306 is a base-level CWE and child of CWE-287. Since the vulnerability involves bypassing authentication due to **incorrect use of JWT**, CWE-287 is the general class, but **CWE-306** is a more specific case of **improper authentication**. CWE-807 is considered since **the JWT is an untrusted input**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe807[\"CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe807 -->|CHILDOF| cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe807 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect use of JWT**, leading to the bypass of authentication.\n1.  **Incorrect Use of JWT:** The root cause is the flawed implementation of JWT.\n2.  **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass the authentication process.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference, points towards an authentication bypass vulnerability. The key phrase \"incorrect use of JWT\" indicates an issue in the authentication mechanism.\n\nThe description states: \"A flaw was found in Apache ShenYu Admin. The **incorrect use of JWT** in ShenyuAdminBootstrap allows an attacker to bypass authentication. This issue affected Apache ShenYu 2.3.0 and 2.4.0\".\n\nThe retriever results suggest CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) as a potential match, but notes this is a discouraged high level class that \"might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable\". CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is also listed and is a child of CWE-287 which is a better match.\n\nConsidering the MITRE mapping guidance, CWE-287 is discouraged because it's a high-level class. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is considered a more specific Base level CWE. The **incorrect use of JWT** means the system is relying on something that should identify a user, but **fails to do so properly**, which is what is described in CWE-306. CWE-807, Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision, is also applicable because the **JWT is an untrusted input**.\n\nTherefore, CWE-287 serves as the primary, higher-level classification, while CWE-306 and CWE-807 provide more specific details about the nature of the authentication failure and the reliance on untrusted inputs.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nWhen an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nauthentification: An alternate term is \"authentification\", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.\nAuthN: \"AuthN\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authentication\" within the web application security community.
