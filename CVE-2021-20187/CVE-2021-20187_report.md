# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-20187

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-98 | Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion') | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-94 | Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') | 0.6 | Base | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-98, is a variant of CWE-706 and CWE-829, indicating a more specific type of weakness related to file inclusion. It can precede CWE-94 (Code Injection), suggesting a potential chain where improper file inclusion leads to code injection. The secondary CWE, CWE-94, is a parent of CWE-96 and CWE-1336, but a child of CWE-74 and CWE-913, which represents the broader category of code injection.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper control of the filename used in a PHP include** statement (CWE-98). This allows site administrators to include arbitrary PHP scripts, which can then lead to the execution of arbitrary code (CWE-94).

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis indicates that the primary weakness is CWE-98, as the **root cause** lies in the **improper control of the filename used in the PHP include statement**. The vulnerability description and CVE summary clearly point to this. The description states that it was possible for site administrators to **execute arbitrary PHP scripts via a PHP include used during Shibboleth authentication**. The CVE summary states the **root cause** as "A **PHP include was used during Shibboleth authentication**, allowing site administrators to execute arbitrary PHP scripts." This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-98, which focuses on **improper control of filenames in include/require statements**.

CWE-94 was considered as a secondary weakness, as the arbitrary PHP script inclusion could lead to the execution of arbitrary code. However, CWE-98 is a more precise and specific description of the **root cause**.

The selection of CWE-98 is further supported by the Retriever Results, which lists CWE-98 as the top combined result. The mapping guidance for CWE-98 explicitly allows its usage and states that it's a preferred level of abstraction (Variant) for mapping to the **root causes** of vulnerabilities.

CWE-79, CWE-116, CWE-434, CWE-863, CWE-96, CWE-89, CWE-22, and CWE-1336 were considered but not selected as they don't directly address the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **improper control of the filename used in the PHP include statement**. These CWEs are more related to the consequences or related vulnerabilities, such as XSS, output encoding, file upload, or SQL injection.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage
