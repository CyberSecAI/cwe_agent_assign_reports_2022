It can precede CWE-94 (Code Injection), suggesting a potential chain where improper file inclusion leads to code injection. The secondary CWE, CWE-94, is a parent of CWE-96 and CWE-1336, but a child of CWE-74 and CWE-913, which represents the broader category of code injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe98[\"CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe706[\"CWE-706\"]\n    cwe829[\"CWE-829\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913\"]\n    cwe96[\"CWE-96\"]\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336\"]\n\n    cwe98 -->|CHILDOF| cwe706\n    cwe98 -->|CHILDOF| cwe829\n    cwe98 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe94\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe94 -->|PARENTOF| cwe96\n    cwe94 -->|PARENTOF| cwe1336\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe98 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper control of the filename used in a PHP include** statement (CWE-98). This allows site administrators to include arbitrary PHP scripts, which can then lead to the execution of arbitrary code (CWE-94).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the primary weakness is CWE-98, as the **root cause** lies in the **improper control of the filename used in the PHP include statement**. The vulnerability description and CVE summary clearly point to this. The description states that it was possible for site administrators to **execute arbitrary PHP scripts via a PHP include used during Shibboleth authentication**. The CVE summary states the **root cause** as \"A **PHP include was used during Shibboleth authentication**, allowing site administrators to execute arbitrary PHP scripts.\" This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-98, which focuses on **improper control of filenames in include/require statements**.\n\nCWE-94 was considered as a secondary weakness, as the arbitrary PHP script inclusion could lead to the execution of arbitrary code. However, CWE-98 is a more precise and specific description of the **root cause**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-98 is further supported by the Retriever Results, which lists CWE-98 as the top combined result. The mapping guidance for CWE-98 explicitly allows its usage and states that it's a preferred level of abstraction (Variant) for mapping to the **root causes** of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-79, CWE-116, CWE-434, CWE-863, CWE-96, CWE-89, CWE-22, and CWE-1336 were considered but not selected as they don't directly address the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **improper control of the filename used in the PHP include statement**. These CWEs are more related to the consequences or related vulnerabilities, such as XSS, output encoding, file upload, or SQL injection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
