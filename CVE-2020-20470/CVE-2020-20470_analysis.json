It is related to CWE-200 (Information Exposure) as a child. The vulnerability involves leaking the physical path of the website, which falls under sensitive information disclosure. This path can aid attackers in planning further attacks.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    \n    cwe209 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe209 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the application failing to prevent the generation of error messages containing sensitive information, specifically the web site's physical path, and this leads to information exposure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified several potential CWEs from the retriever results, but CWE-209 best fits the vulnerability description because the **root cause** is the exposure of the web site's physical path through error messages.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"White Shark System (WSS) 1.3.2 has web site physical path leakage vulnerability.\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states \"The application reveals its physical path through various files including `control_file.php`, `control_log.php`, `control_project.php`, `control_task.php`, `tree.php`. **Weakness:** Exposing the server's internal file structure allows attackers to gain knowledge about the application's environment. **Impact:** Information disclosure, which could facilitate more advanced attacks. **Attack Vector:** By accessing the mentioned files, an attacker can discover the server's physical file path.\".\n\nThis aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-209: \"The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\"\n\nCWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) was also considered, given that accessing the files directly leads to the disclosure. However, the **root cause** isn't the lack of authorization, but the information leakage itself. Thus, CWE-209 is more appropriate.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-209 is based on the direct evidence of sensitive information exposure through error messages and the CWE's alignment with the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information",
