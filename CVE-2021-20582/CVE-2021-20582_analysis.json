This hierarchical relationship indicates that CWE-598 is a more specific case of CWE-201, focusing on the use of GET requests. The parent CWE, CWE-201, covers the general case of sensitive information being inserted into sent data. The choice of CWE-598 is driven by the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning the storage of sensitive information in URL parameters, which directly relates to GET requests.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe598[\"CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    \n    cwe598 -->|CHILDOF| cwe201\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe598 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper storage** of sensitive information in URL parameters (CWE-598), which leads to information disclosure if unauthorized parties gain access to the URLs via server logs, referrer headers, or browser history.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the analysis focused on identifying the root cause and impact as outlined in the vulnerability description. The key phrase \"**improper information storage**\" pointed towards a storage-related CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions URL parameters, making CWE-598 a strong candidate.\n\nThe retriever results also supported this, with CWE-598 having the highest score. Although other CWEs like CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) were considered, CWE-598 was chosen due to its specificity. The relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-598 is a variant of CWE-201, making it a more precise fit.\n\nThe final decision is based on the vulnerability description, retriever results, and relationship analysis. CWE-598 is the most specific and relevant CWE, accurately representing the vulnerability where sensitive information is stored in URL parameters transmitted via GET requests, potentially leading to information disclosure. This selection is at the optimal level of specificity (Variant).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.

In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders.
