While discouraged, it is appropriate here given the lack of specifics for a more granular CWE. |\n| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | The vulnerability stems from a **missing access control** check on the `enumerateRoles` method, which can also be described as an authorization problem. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the selection was:\n  - CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE that describes the general exposure of sensitive information.\n  - CWE-863 is a Class-level CWE that describes the general case of incorrect authorization.\n  - CWE-497 is a Base-level CWE that describes the exposure of sensitive system information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe863 -->|PeerOf| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe497,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing access control**, leading to **information disclosure**.\n  - **Root Cause:** Missing Access Control\n  - **Weakness:** Information Disclosure\n  - **Impact:** Listing of role names, potentially leading to further attacks\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the analysis focused on the **information disclosure** aspect of the vulnerability, as highlighted in the description. The \"Retriever Results\" and \"Complete CWE Specifications\" were then reviewed to identify the most suitable CWE.\n\nThe primary selection is CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor), because the core issue is that sensitive information (role names) are being exposed due to the **missing access control**. However, CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and is discouraged because more specific CWEs should be selected if possible.\n\nThe secondary selection is CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). The `enumerateRoles` method lacked proper access restrictions, thus an authorization problem exists, leading to the **information disclosure**.\n\nCWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) was considered but not selected because it is more focused on exposure of system-level information, whereas this vulnerability is more about application-level role names.\n\nBased on the provided evidence, CWE-200 is the most appropriate primary CWE due to the direct **information disclosure**, and CWE-863 is a secondary CWE because of the **missing access control** leading to that disclosure. These selections are at an adequate level of specificity, considering the information available.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available.
