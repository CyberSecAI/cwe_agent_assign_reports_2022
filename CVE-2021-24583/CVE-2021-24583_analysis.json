The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. |\n| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 0.9 | Compound | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]**, which indicates a failure to perform necessary authorization checks. It's a child of the broader **CWE-285 [Improper Authorization]**, but **CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]** is more specific. **CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]** is a compound weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe352 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves **Missing Authorization** and **CSRF**.\n\n1.  **Missing Authorization (CWE-862)**: The plugin lacks proper access control, allowing unauthorized users (contributor+) to attempt deleting timeslots.\n2.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CWE-352)**: The absence of CSRF protection allows attackers to trick authorized users into performing unwanted actions, such as deleting timeslots.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference. The description clearly states the **rootcause** is **improper access control**, which maps directly to **CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]**. The absence of CSRF protection contributes to the vulnerability, leading to **CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]**.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]** is at the class level, which is appropriate because the details provided do not specify how the authorization check is missing, just that it is missing. **CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]** is a compound weakness that needs to be included.\n\nThe evidence is strong because the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" sections explicitly mention the lack of access control and CSRF protection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names.
