CWE-77 is a more general class of command injection. CWE-20 is a class-level CWE indicating improper input validation, which can be a precursor to command injection. The hierarchical relationship between CWE-78 and CWE-77 indicates that CWE-78 is a specific type of CWE-77. The CanPrecede relationship from CWE-20 to CWE-78 highlights that input validation issues can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: OS Command Injection\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Command Injection\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe78\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input sanitization**, leading to **command injection**, and ultimately allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper input sanitization**\n  - **Weakness:** **Command Injection** (CWE-78)\n  - **Impact:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary OS commands.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the provided CVE reference links content summary, both of which clearly indicate a **command injection** vulnerability due to **improper input sanitization**. The primary match, CWE-78, is consistent with the identified weakness.\n\nEvidence:\n- Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"rootcause: **improper input sanitization**\", \"weakness: **command injection**\", \"impact: execute arbitrary OS commands\"\n- CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The 'command' parameter is directly passed by the attacker without sanitization.\", \"weakness: Command Injection\", \"impact: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary OS commands.\"\n\nThe retriever results also support CWE-78 as a strong candidate. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-78 is a specific type of command injection and is appropriately chosen. The decision to map CWE-78 is based on clear evidence and supported by relationship analysis and retriever results. It is at the optimal level of specificity because the vulnerability clearly involves OS command injection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
