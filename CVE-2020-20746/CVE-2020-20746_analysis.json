CWE-120 is also related, as a `Base` CWE of CWE-119, which is a broader `Class` that includes various buffer handling issues. CWE-190 is also considered because an integer overflow can lead to buffer overflows, but it's not the primary cause here. CWE-1284 is considered because **improper input validation** of the size could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe788[\"CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After the End of the Buffer\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe119 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe1284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe120,cwe1284 secondary\n    class cwe787,cwe788,cwe119,cwe20 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **lack of input validation** (CWE-1284), leading to a **stack-based buffer overflow** (CWE-121), which can then result in arbitrary code execution or denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference links.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a \"**stack-based buffer overflow**\" exists. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause** is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `fromSetRouteStatic` function due to the use of `sscanf` without proper bounds checking, parsing user-supplied content into a stack variable. This confirms that CWE-121 is a good fit.\n\nThe use of `sscanf` without validation implies that the size of the input is not being checked against the size of the buffer, which is also described by CWE-120: \"Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\". Since the overflow is happening on the stack, CWE-121 is a more precise description.\n\nThe **lack of input validation** also means that CWE-1284 \"Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\" is applicable. The \"list\" parameter from the HTTP POST request is not validated for length, leading to the overflow.\n\nCWE-119 \"Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\" is too general, and is discouraged by MITRE when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nCWE-190 \"Integer Overflow or Wraparound\" is not directly applicable, as the vulnerability is not primarily caused by an integer overflow.\n\nThe selection of CWE-121 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly reflects the **root cause** described in the vulnerability description and CVE reference.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nStack Overflow: \"Stack Overflow\" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call.
