The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of the package parameter, allowing an attacker to inject carriage return characters. |\n| CWE-117 | Improper Output Neutralization for Logs | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The impact of the CRLF injection is the ability to inject malicious data into system logs. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-93, which is a Base level weakness describing the improper neutralization of CRLF sequences. This can lead to CWE-117, Improper Output Neutralization for Logs, as the injected CRLF sequences can be used to manipulate log output. CWE-93 is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe117[\"CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe93 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe93 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe117\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe93 primary\n    class cwe117 secondary\n    class cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** input sanitization (**weakness**) of the package parameter. This leads to the injection of CRLF sequences (CWE-93), which then allows the attacker to inject malicious data into the system logs (CWE-117).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **weakness** of **command injection** and the impact of injecting logs, leading to consideration of CWE-77 and CWE-78. However, the root cause is the **improper neutralization** of CRLF sequences, making CWE-93 the most appropriate primary CWE. The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms this, stating that \"The primary vulnerability is a CRLF injection.\" The ability to inject malicious data into logs is a direct consequence of the CRLF injection, making CWE-117 a secondary weakness.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-93 can precede CWE-117, indicating that the CRLF injection leads to the log injection. CWE-93 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level for root cause analysis. The selection of CWE-93 and CWE-117 is based on the provided evidence and the relationships between the CWEs.\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically:\n- \"The `SchedulerServer` in VMware Photon OS is vulnerable to log injection due to insufficient input sanitization. Specifically, the package parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject carriage return (`\\r`) characters.\"\n- \"The primary vulnerability is a CRLF injection, which is a type of log injection vulnerability.\"\n- \"By injecting carriage return and line feed characters (`\\r\\n`), an attacker can manipulate log output, potentially inserting arbitrary data, including malicious code, or creating fake entries.\"\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1236: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by a spreadsheet product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason not used:* This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability does not involve CSV files or formula injection.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*Reason not used:* While CWE-74 is a parent of CWE-93, CWE-93 is a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason not used:* The vulnerability is not due to an incomplete list of disallowed inputs, but rather the absence of proper input sanitization.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
