The secondary weakness is **blind SSRF**, which maps to CWE-918. Both CWE-79 and CWE-918 are base-level CWEs, providing the right level of specificity. CWE-918 is a child of CWE-441 (Unintended Proxy or Intermediary).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe441[\"CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary\"]\n    \n    cwe918 -->|CHILDOF| cwe441\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe918 secondary\n    class cwe441 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves:\n1.  **Improper Neutralization of Input (CWE-79):** User-provided input is not properly sanitized.\n2.  **Server-Side Request Forgery (CWE-918):** The application makes requests to external servers based on user-controlled input, without proper validation, leading to potential SSRF.\n\nCWE-79 and CWE-918 are independent weaknesses exploited via text-based feedback answers.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis identifies two primary weaknesses: **stored XSS** and **blind SSRF**. The vulnerability description clearly states that \"Text-based feedback answers required additional sanitizing to prevent **stored XSS** and **blind SSRF** risks.\" The most relevant CWEs are CWE-79 for **stored XSS** and CWE-918 for **blind SSRF**. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.\n\nCWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) is selected because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"stored XSS,\" indicating that user input is not properly neutralized before being displayed on a web page.\n\nCWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)) is selected because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"blind SSRF,\" indicating that the application is making requests to external servers based on user-controlled input without proper validation.\n\nOther CWEs like CWE-174 (Double Decoding of the Same Data) and CWE-611 (Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference) were considered but deemed less relevant because the description directly indicates XSS and SSRF. The primary focus is on the **improper sanitization** that leads to both vulnerabilities.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product violates well-established principles for secure design.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
