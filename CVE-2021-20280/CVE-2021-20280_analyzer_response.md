# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2021-20280

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-918 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | 0.9 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **stored XSS**, which maps directly to CWE-79. The secondary weakness is **blind SSRF**, which maps to CWE-918. Both CWE-79 and CWE-918 are base-level CWEs, providing the right level of specificity. CWE-918 is a child of CWE-441 (Unintended Proxy or Intermediary).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain involves:
1.  **Improper Neutralization of Input (CWE-79):** User-provided input is not properly sanitized.
2.  **Server-Side Request Forgery (CWE-918):** The application makes requests to external servers based on user-controlled input, without proper validation, leading to potential SSRF.

CWE-79 and CWE-918 are independent weaknesses exploited via text-based feedback answers.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis identifies two primary weaknesses: **stored XSS** and **blind SSRF**. The vulnerability description clearly states that "Text-based feedback answers required additional sanitizing to prevent **stored XSS** and **blind SSRF** risks." The most relevant CWEs are CWE-79 for **stored XSS** and CWE-918 for **blind SSRF**. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.

CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) is selected because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions "stored XSS," indicating that user input is not properly neutralized before being displayed on a web page.

CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)) is selected because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions "blind SSRF," indicating that the application is making requests to external servers based on user-controlled input without proper validation.

Other CWEs like CWE-174 (Double Decoding of the Same Data) and CWE-611 (Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference) were considered but deemed less relevant because the description directly indicates XSS and SSRF. The primary focus is on the **improper sanitization** that leads to both vulnerabilities.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product violates well-established principles for secure design.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
