A more specific CWE, CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), exists as a child of CWE-400. However, the vulnerability description only mentions \"uncontrolled resource consumption\", without explicitly stating that the resources are being allocated without limits. Therefore, I chose CWE-400.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **uncontrolled resource consumption**, leading to information disclosure.\n  - **Root Cause:** Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)\n  - **Impact:** Information Disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-400 as the primary weakness, due to the **uncontrolled resource consumption**. While CWE-400 has a discouraged usage, the root cause aligns with the description. The retriever results also listed CWE-400 as the top combined result. CWE-770 was considered as a more specific variant, but the description does not explicitly mention allocation of resources without limits. Therefore, CWE-400 was chosen as the primary CWE.\n\nThe decision is based on the following evidence:\n\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** \"**rootcause:** **uncontrolled resource consumption**\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled resource consumption in Intel HAXM software.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
