CWE-200 is a class-level CWE, while there may be more specific child CWEs that could apply, CWE-200 is the best fit because it captures the general exposure of sensitive information. CWE-668 is a class-level CWE and is a child of a Pillar, making it a less desirable choice. CWE-863 is related to authorization, which is a contributing factor but not the core issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe668 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe668,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Improper Access Control:** The application **fails to properly restrict access** to sensitive patient data.\n2.  **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive patient information is included in the server response, even when access should be denied.\n3.  **Confidentiality breach:** Unauthorized low-privileged users can access sensitive patient information, violating patient privacy and confidentiality.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the fact that sensitive information was being exposed, which led to considering CWE-200 and its related CWEs. The final decision to assign CWE-200 as the primary CWE is based on the fact that the application **fails to properly restrict access**, leading to the exposure of sensitive information. This is supported by the vulnerability description, which states, \"Apperta Foundation OpenEyes 3.5.1 allows remote attackers to **view the sensitive information of patients without having the intended level of privilege**.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the core issue of exposing sensitive information to unauthorized actors. While more specific CWEs could potentially be considered, they would not fully capture the essence of the vulnerability as effectively as CWE-200.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
