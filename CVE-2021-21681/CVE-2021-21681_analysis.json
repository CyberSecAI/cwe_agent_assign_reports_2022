CWE-256 is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), which is a Class level CWE. This parent-child relationship indicates that CWE-256 is a more specific case of CWE-522. Given the description clearly states the password is stored in plaintext, CWE-256 is the more appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** The Nomad Plugin stores Docker passwords **unencrypted** in the global config.xml file. (CWE-256)\n2.  **Weakness:** The passwords can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system. (CWE-256)\n3.  **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Docker registries if the exposed credentials are valid.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis and the retriever results point to CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) and CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) as potential candidates. The vulnerability description states that the passwords are stored **unencrypted** which directly aligns with CWE-256.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description: \"Jenkins Nomad Plugin 0.7.4 and earlier stores Docker passwords **unencrypted** in the global config.xml file on the Jenkins controller where they can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.\"\n\nCWE-256 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the storage of passwords in plaintext. While CWE-522 is also relevant, it is a more general class of weakness.\nCWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) was considered, but CWE-256 is more specific, as it explicitly refers to passwords.\nCWE-260 (Password in Configuration File) was considered, and while it is similar, CWE-256 better captures the essence of the vulnerability, which is the storage of passwords in plaintext form rather than simply existing in the configuration file.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive

Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a
