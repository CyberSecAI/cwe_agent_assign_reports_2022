CWE-863 is a Class level CWE and a child of CWE-285 and CWE-284.

The vulnerability description states that \"The Insert Pages WordPress plugin before 3.7.0 allows users with a role as low as Contributor to access content and metadata from arbitrary posts/pages regardless of their author and status (ie private), using a shortcode.\" The root cause is the plugin **incorrectly assigning privileges** to users, allowing contributors to access content they should not have access to.\n\nCWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) is selected because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability, where users are granted unintended access due to misconfigured privileges. The description of CWE-266 aligns with the vulnerability where a Contributor role is incorrectly assigned the privilege to access any page, regardless of its intended access restrictions.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a secondary candidate because it represents a broader class of authorization issues. While the vulnerability involves incorrect authorization, the more specific **Incorrect Privilege Assignment** pinpoints the exact flaw. \"The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check\" which occurs in this vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is considered as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability leads to the exposure of content and metadata from private posts/pages to unauthorized users. The description of the CWE states: \"The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor\" which is a result of this vulnerability.\n\nThe final selection prioritizes CWE-266 for its precise match to the **root cause**, while acknowledging the presence of broader authorization and information exposure aspects captured by CWE-863 and CWE-201 respectively.",
