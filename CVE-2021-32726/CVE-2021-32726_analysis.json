CWE-459 is a more specific type of resource release issue. CWE-772 (Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime) is a peer of CWE-459 and child of CWE-404 as well, and also strongly related.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe459[\"CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    cwe772[\"CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\"]\n\n    cwe459 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    cwe772 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe459 primary\n    class cwe404,cwe772 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the **failure to delete webauthn tokens** after user deletion (**ROOTCAUSE**), leading to the potential for unauthorized access if the username is reused (**IMPACT**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the core issue: **\"webauthn tokens were not deleted after a user has been deleted.\"** This directly points to a cleanup problem. The supporting evidence in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" reinforces this, stating \"**Incomplete cleanup of user-related data, specifically WebAuthn tokens, upon user deletion**\" and \"**Failure to invalidate or remove authentication tokens associated with a deleted user**\". The relationship graph shows that CWE-459 (Incomplete Cleanup) is a child of CWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release), indicating a more specific type of resource management issue. CWE-459 is also a base level weakness, the preferred level of abstraction. Therefore, CWE-459 is the best choice.\n\nCWE-772 (Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime) was considered as a secondary candidate, because the tokens should have been released when the user was deleted.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.85\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly \"clean up\" and remove temporary or supporting resources after they have been used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
