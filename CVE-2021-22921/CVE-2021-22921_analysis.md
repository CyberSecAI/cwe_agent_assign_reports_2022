# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-732 | Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource | 1.0 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |
| CWE-427 | Uncontrolled Search Path Element | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-59 | Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-732, which falls under the Class abstraction level. CWE-732 is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere). We considered the base case CWE-427, and CWE-59. There isn't a clear parent-child relationship, but CWE-427 and CWE-59 can result from bad permissions.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper configuration of permissions** (CWE-732), leading to PATH and DLL hijacking. The PATH and DLL hijacking could be represented by CWE-427 and CWE-59, respectively.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified **improper configuration of permissions** as the root cause, leading to local privilege escalation. The primary CWE mapping is CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource), which aligns with the **improper permission configuration** in the installation directory. The reference summary explicitly states this **root_cause** and also indicates resultant PATH and DLL hijacking, which are impacts.

The retriever results also suggest CWE-427 (Uncontrolled Search Path Element) and CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')) as potential CWEs. These align with the PATH and DLL hijacking impacts. While these could be considered, they are more accurately described as impacts of the **improper permissions**, rather than the root cause itself.

The selection of CWE-732 is at the class level. Although a base level CWE is preferable, there isn't a more specific CWE that directly addresses **improper configuration of permissions** for a critical resource, leading to privilege escalation. The evidence directly supports this classification, with the vulnerability description key phrases and CVE reference links content summary pointing to **improper permissions**.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.

### Extended Description
When a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which "permissions" are not checked, which is an "authorization" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure "Everyone: Full Control" permissions for files under the "Program Files" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.
- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.

**Explanation:** This CWE is a good fit because the **root cause** is the **improper configuration of permissions** in the installation directory, which allows unintended actors to perform privilege escalation attacks. The description of CWE-732 directly matches this scenario.

## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.

### Extended Description
Although this weakness can occur with any type of resource, it is frequently introduced when a product uses a directory search path to find executables or code libraries, but the path contains a directory that can be modified by an attacker, such as "/tmp" or the current working directory.

In Windows-based systems, when the LoadLibrary or LoadLibraryEx function is called with a DLL name that does not contain a fully qualified path, the function follows a search order that includes two path elements that might be uncontrolled:
  - the directory from which the program has been loaded
  - the current working directory

In some cases, the attack can be conducted remotely, such as when SMB or WebDAV network shares are used.

One or more locations in that path could include the Windows drive root or its subdirectories. This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory. In Windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled.

In some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element.

In software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository. This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.

### Alternative Terms
DLL preloading: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.
Binary planting: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.
Insecure library loading: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.
Dependency confusion: As of February 2021, this term is used to describe CWE-427 in the context of managing installation of software package dependencies, in which attackers release
