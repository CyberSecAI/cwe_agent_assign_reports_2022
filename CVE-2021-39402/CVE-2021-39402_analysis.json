CWE-79 is a base CWE and a child of CWE-74.\nCWE-96 is a base CWE and a child of CWE-94 and is related to static code injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe96[\"CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe96 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe96 secondary\n    class cwe74,cwe94 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a **lack of input sanitization**, leading to **code injection**, which results in **stored XSS**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **code injection** as the primary weakness. The analysis of the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary confirmed that the application **fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input** when adding a new product via the admin panel, allowing for the **injection of malicious code**. This injected payload is then stored and reflected on the affiliate main page.\n\nThe evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states:\n*   \"**Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when adding a new product through the admin panel. This allows for the **injection of malicious code**.\"\n*   \"**Stored XSS:** The injected payload is stored in the database and later reflected on the affiliate main page. This means that the malicious script is executed whenever a user (authenticated or unauthenticated) visits the affiliate page.\"\n\nThe retriever results also indicated CWE-79 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) is the primary CWE because the injected code is reflected on the affiliate main page, affecting all visitors. This aligns with the CWE-79 description: \"The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\"\n\nCWE-96 (Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')) is a secondary candidate because the injected code is stored in the database and then statically included in the web page. This is based on the description: \"The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause (lack of input sanitization) and the manifestation of the vulnerability (XSS). CWE-79 accurately captures the XSS nature of the vulnerability, while CWE-96 highlights the static code injection aspect.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
