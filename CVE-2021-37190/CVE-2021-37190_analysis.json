CWE-203 [Observable Discrepancy] is also a child of CWE-200, representing a more specific form of information exposure. CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] is a child of CWE-287 [Improper Authentication], indicating that the function lacks any authentication mechanism. These hierarchical relationships help refine the selection, favoring CWE-200 due to its direct relevance to the vulnerability description. CWE-284 [Improper Access Control] is a high-level pillar that is too general to be a good fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe203 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe668,cwe203,cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper access control** and authentication mechanisms, which leads to the **exposure of sensitive VPN connection information** to an unauthorized actor.\n  - Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306) --> Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description's emphasis on information disclosure. The description states: \"The affected software has an information disclosure vulnerability that could allow an attacker to retrieve VPN connection for a known user.\" However, it is stated that CWE-200 is \"commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.\"\n\nFurther analysis considered the root cause of the information disclosure. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states that the attacker \"does not need to be authenticated to exploit this issue.\" This points to a missing authentication mechanism that allows unauthorized access to the VPN connection details. Therefore, CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] was considered as a secondary weakness that contributes to the vulnerability. The analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] is based on the direct impact of the vulnerability, which is the exposure of VPN connection information. While CWE-200 is generally discouraged as a primary mapping due to its high-level nature, in this case, it accurately reflects the immediate consequence of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] is selected as a secondary weakness because it represents the underlying root cause that enables the information disclosure. The absence of authentication for accessing VPN connection details allows an attacker to retrieve this information without proper authorization.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the vulnerability's impact and root cause. CWE-200 captures the information disclosure aspect, while CWE-306 identifies the missing authentication mechanism.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n*Not Selected*: This vulnerability doesn't rely on modifying inputs, but rather the absence of authentication.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n*Not Selected*: The vulnerability description doesn't state that an authentication algorithm was incorrectly implemented.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n*Not Selected*: This doesn't relate to the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
