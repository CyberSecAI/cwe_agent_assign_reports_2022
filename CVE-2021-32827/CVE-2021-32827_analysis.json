The secondary CWE is CWE-94, a Base level weakness and is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) and CWE-913 (Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe942[\"CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\"]\n    cwe183[\"CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\"]\n    cwe923[\"CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n\n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe183\n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe923\n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe942 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **overly broad default CORS configuration** (CWE-942) and **script injection** (CWE-94), leading to arbitrary code execution.\n  - Initial Flaw: **Permissive Cross-domain Policy** and **Script Injection**.\n  - Resulting Impact: **Arbitrary Code Execution**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The description clearly indicates two main issues: an overly broad CORS configuration and the possibility of script injection. The CVE reference confirms these issues, stating that the application has a default CORS configuration that is too broad and allows for script injection using Javascript or Velocity templates.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-942 (Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains) because the description explicitly mentions the overly broad CORS configuration. The CVE reference supports this by stating, \"The MockServer application has a default CORS configuration that is too broad, allowing any site to send cross-site requests.\"\n\nThe secondary CWE is CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')) because the application allows for script injection using Javascript or Velocity templates. The CVE reference confirms this by stating, \"it allows for script injection using Javascript or Velocity templates. The Javascript templates are evaluated using an unsandboxed Nashorn engine, and Velocity uses a script engine configured with VelocityScriptEngineFactory, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on behalf of MockServer.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-942 being a Variant and CWE-94 being a Base. Both accurately represent the weaknesses described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
