CWE-400 is a class-level CWE, with CWE-770 as a child (base) CWE. The analysis also considered CWE-1284 as it can precede CWE-789, which is a child of CWE-770, forming a potential chain. Since the vulnerability involves a large password leading to resource exhaustion, CWE-770 and CWE-1284 provide more specific details than the general CWE-400, but are still secondary because the description focuses on the uncontrolled aspect of the resource consumption more than the specific allocation or validation issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe789\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the user submitting a large password.\n- The `UserAttributeSimilarityValidator` **fails to properly control or limit** the resources consumed when evaluating the password's similarity against user attributes (**ROOT CAUSE: CWE-400**).\n- This leads to excessive resource allocation without limits (**CWE-770**)\n- Possibly due to **improper validation of the password quantity** (**CWE-1284**).\n- The uncontrolled resource consumption then causes a denial-of-service (**IMPACT**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the denial-of-service impact. However, further examination of the description and the reference links revealed the **ROOT CAUSE** to be the **uncontrolled resource consumption** within the `UserAttributeSimilarityValidator` component when handling an artificially large password. This led to the selection of CWE-400 as the primary CWE.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"UserAttributeSimilarityValidator incurred significant overhead in evaluating a submitted password that was artificially large in relation to the comparison values. In a situation where access to user registration was unrestricted, this provided a potential vector for a denial-of-service attack.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-400 is justified by the phrase \"**significant overhead**\" and the overall context of **uncontrolled resource consumption leading to denial-of-service**. CWE-400 is the best fit because the validator **fails to control** how much resource it consumes for large passwords.\n\nCWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) and CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) are included as secondary CWEs since the root cause is the lack of resource control (CWE-400), which could stem from a lack of limits when allocating resources (CWE-770) and/or a failure to validate the quantity/size of the input (CWE-1284).\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they represent the underlying weakness (CWE-400) and contributing factors (CWE-770, CWE-1284) that led to the denial-of-service.\nWhile CWE-400 is Class level, the provided evidence focuses on the uncontrolled resource consumption aspect of the validator. If more information was provided about how memory was allocated or input was validated, then it would be possible to choose lower level CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Why Not Used**: While the scenario involves amplification, the primary issue is the lack of control over resource consumption, not necessarily the asymmetric nature of the attack.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Why Not Used**: This CWE focuses on interaction frequency, which is not the primary issue in this vulnerability.
