This is a specific type of CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write, which is in turn a specific case of CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (Class). The analysis also considered CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') (Base) as a related weakness because the `strcpy` function, which copies the buffer without checking size, is used. However, since the overflow is explicitly stated to be on the stack, CWE-121 is preferred.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe120 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **improper handling of user-supplied input** via a POST request. The `get_var` function extracts this input without proper bounds checking. The extracted string is then copied into a stack buffer using `strcpy`, resulting in a **stack buffer overflow**. This overflow allows an attacker to overwrite the return address on the stack, leading to **arbitrary code execution** and potential **device compromise**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a **stack buffer overflow** due to the use of `strcpy` without bounds checking when handling user-supplied input from a POST request. The primary CWE selected is CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow, as the description explicitly mentions a stack buffer overflow. This is supported by the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**, \"**weakness:** **stack buffer overflow**\" and the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**, which states, \"The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow\" and \"The extracted string is then copied into a stack buffer using `strcpy` without any bounds checking\".\n\nCWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer was considered because it is a more general class of weakness that includes buffer overflows. However, since the vulnerability is specifically a stack-based buffer overflow, CWE-121 is more appropriate. Furthermore, the mapping notes for CWE-119 advises looking at the children of CWE-119 and considering CWEs such as CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write, and CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read, or others.\n\nCWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') was considered because the root cause involves copying a buffer without checking its size. However, since the vulnerability is specifically a stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121), and CWE-120 is not as specific as CWE-121, CWE-121 is preferred. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** further clarifies the root cause: \"The extracted string is then copied into a stack buffer using `strcpy` without any bounds checking, leading to a stack overflow if the input string is too long.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-121 directly describes the vulnerability. This decision is based on the evidence provided and the MITRE mapping guidance to choose the most specific CWE available.",
