While CWE-285 and CWE-284 are more general, CWE-862 directly addresses the specific issue of a missing authorization check. The Class abstraction level is appropriate because while the description specifies a **missing permission check**, it does not provide the detail to select a lower level Base.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing permission check** (CWE-862) in the `isBackupServiceActive` function.\n2.  **Impact:** Local information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence. The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section explicitly states the **rootcause** as a **missing permission check**. This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), where the product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\nThe provided evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-862.\nThe description explicitly states a **missing permission check**, and CWE-862 directly addresses this. The impact, local information disclosure, is a common consequence of missing authorization.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest CWE-862 as the best candidate.\nBased on the evidence, CWE-862 is the optimal level of specificity. Other more specific CWEs were considered but not used. Specifically, looking at retriever results.\n*   CWE-927 (Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication): While related to Android vulnerabilities, this CWE is not appropriate because the vulnerability is not related to implicit intents.\n*   CWE-926 (Improper Export of Android Application Components): While this is related to android this vulnerability does not stem from an exported component.\n*   CWE-1021 (Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames): This vulnerability has nothing to do with UI rendering.\n*   CWE-223 (Omission of Security-relevant Information): While information is being disclosed, the root cause is not an omission of security relevant information.\n*   CWE-941 (Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel): This has nothing to do with destinations for communications.\n*   CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource): This has nothing to do with uninitialized resources.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n*   CWE-862 (Missing Authorization): The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. The vulnerability description states a **missing permission check**. This is a direct match. The security implication is unauthorized access to resources, which aligns with the stated impact of local information disclosure.",
