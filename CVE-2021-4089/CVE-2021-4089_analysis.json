CWE-862 is a child of CWE-284, indicating a more specific type of access control issue. CWE-639 is a child of CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) which is Peer of CWE-862. The choice between these depends on whether authorization is missing or incorrect. The abstraction levels guided the selection, favoring the more specific Class level (CWE-862) over the high-level Pillar (CWE-284) when the evidence supports it.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe862 -- PEEROF --> cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe284,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of an authorization check** (**missing authorization**). This leads to the impact where users with insufficient privileges can perform unauthorized actions (asset model cloning).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description points to a general \"Improper Access Control\". However, the provided content, specifically the commit diff, reveals that the issue is the **missing authorization** check (`$this->authorize('create', AssetModel::class);`) in the `getClone` function. This indicates that users with only view permissions were able to access the clone functionality, which should require create permissions.\n\nThe retriever results and the relationship graph support this assessment. CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) are strong candidates. However, given the direct evidence of the **missing** authorization check, CWE-862 is the most appropriate primary CWE. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is too general. CWE-639 is also a possible candidate, however requires a \"user-controlled key\", which is not mentioned in the description.\n\nTherefore, the chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, accurately reflecting the **root cause** of the vulnerability based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
