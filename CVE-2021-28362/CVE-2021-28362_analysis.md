# Analysis for CVE-2021-28362

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-191 | Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound) | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-191, which is a Base level CWE. It is a child of CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation). CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) is a peer, and can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). This highlights the importance of using the base level CWE, as it most accurately reflects the weakness.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **unchecked packet length and extension header length**, which leads to a **integer underflow**, which causes memory corruption and results in a denial of service.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which clearly indicates that an **integer underflow** occurs due to **unchecked packet length and extension header length**. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" reinforces this by mentioning memory management bugs. The retriever results list CWE-191 as the top candidate.

The evidence from the Vulnerability Description is: "Because the packet length and the extension header length are unchecked (with respect to the available data) at this stage, and these variables are susceptible to **integer underflow**, it is possible to construct an invalid extension header that will cause memory corruption issues and lead to a Denial-of-Service condition."

The graph relationships confirm that CWE-191 is a base level CWE.

CWE-191 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **integer underflow** vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
An algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product acts as an intermediary HTTP agent
         (such as a proxy or firewall) in the data flow between two
         entities such as a client and server, but it does not
         interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that
         are consistent with how the messages will be processed by
         those entities that are at the ultimate destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6385.54
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6349.04
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that
