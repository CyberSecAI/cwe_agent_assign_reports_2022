Additionally, CWE-1333 can lead to CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) as a consequence. The fact that CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data) can be a prerequisite for the execution of the regular expression strengthens the case for considering it as a contributing factor.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n\n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe1333 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe400\n    cwe502 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe1333\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407,cwe400,cwe502 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502), which allows an attacker to inject a malicious regular expression. The inefficient regular expression (CWE-1333) then consumes excessive CPU cycles, leading to uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) and ultimately a denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the description points to a denial-of-service vulnerability due to a **ClassCastException**. However, the CVE reference links content summary provides more detailed information and points to a ReDoS vulnerability.\n\nThe key evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary is:\n*   \"The vulnerability stems from XStream's processing of an input stream containing type information used to recreate objects. An attacker can manipulate this input stream by injecting objects that lead to the execution of a malicious regular expression. This regex evaluation then causes a denial-of-service condition.\"\n*   \"The core weakness lies in XStream's ability to dynamically create instances based on provided type information, which is not inherently safe, and a failure to properly sanitize user-provided data before using it in regular expressions.\"\n\nBased on this, CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity) is the most accurate primary mapping because it specifically addresses the root cause of the denial-of-service.\n\nCWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data) is included as a secondary candidate because the vulnerability arises from processing untrusted data during deserialization. The XStream library deserializes data without proper validation, allowing the injection of malicious objects.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is also considered, as the exploitation of the ReDoS vulnerability leads to excessive CPU consumption and a denial-of-service. However, it is a more general consequence of the primary weakness (CWE-1333). The MITRE guidance discourages direct mapping to CWE-400, encouraging identification of the underlying cause.\n\nTherefore, CWE-1333 is selected as the primary CWE due to its direct relevance to the root cause (inefficient regular expression), while CWE-502 and CWE-400 are considered contributing factors or consequences.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
