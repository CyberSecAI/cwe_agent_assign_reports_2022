CWE-497 is a child of CWE-200 which is a Class level CWE. CWE-306 is a base level CWE and a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). The vulnerability involves exposure of sensitive system information to an unauthorized actor, making CWE-497 a more specific fit than its parent CWE-200. CWE-306 is considered because the attacker is unauthenticated, but the core issue is the exposure of information, not the lack of authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe497 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the **exposure** of sensitive system-level information due to **missing** access controls. The **impact** is an unauthenticated attacker viewing system information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is CWE-497, \"Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere.\" This is supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states: \"The exacqVision Web Service **exposes** sensitive system-level information.\" This directly aligns with the CWE-497 description: \"The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors.\" The retriever results also list CWE-497 as the top combined result.\n\nCWE-200, \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor,\" was considered as a parent of CWE-497, however, CWE-497 is more specific, and the evidence directly supports that this is sensitive system information and therefore the primary CWE should be CWE-497. The mapping guidance for CWE-200 discourages its use when more specific options are available.\n\nCWE-306, \"Missing Authentication for Critical Function,\" was considered since the attacker is unauthenticated. However, the root cause is the **exposure** of information and not the **missing** authentication. It is not a critical function that requires authentication, but an information disclosure. Therefore, it is considered a secondary candidate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-497 at the Base level is optimal due to the direct evidence and specificity it provides, fitting the vulnerability description more accurately than the higher-level Class CWE-200.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
