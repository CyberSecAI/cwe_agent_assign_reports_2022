Since CWE-126 is a more specific variant of CWE-125, it is chosen as the primary CWE. CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) is also considered due to the heap allocation mentioned in the description. The abstraction levels are important as they guide the selection of the most specific and appropriate CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe126[\"CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe788[\"CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe125\n    cwe126 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe126 primary\n    class cwe125,cwe122 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves an out-of-bounds read in a heap-allocated buffer, leading to a crash and potential code execution.\n  - **Root Cause:** Heap-based **buffer over-read** due to improper handling of input\n  - **Weakness:** **Out-of-bounds Read** (CWE-125), more specifically **Buffer Over-read** (CWE-126).\n  - **Impact:** Crash, memory corruption, potential arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a **heap-based buffer over-read** vulnerability in fast_ber. The primary CWE selected is CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read), which is a variant of CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read). The vulnerability occurs due to reading data past the end of a heap-allocated buffer. This assessment is based on the vulnerability description stating a **heap-based buffer over-read**, and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms an out-of-bounds read in the `yy::yylex(Context&)` function, leading to a crash.\n\nThe selection of CWE-126 is justified by the fact that it is a more specific variant of CWE-125 and accurately describes the **buffer over-read**. While CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) was considered, it was deemed less appropriate as the primary weakness is the read operation, not the write operation associated with overflows.\n\nThe evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section clearly identifies the **weakness** as a \"**heap-based buffer over-read**\". Furthermore, the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section supports this by stating: \"A heap-buffer-overflow occurs within the `yy::yylex(Context&)` function at `asn_compiler.hpp:11676` due to an out-of-bounds read during parsing.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-126 and CWE-125, guiding the choice towards the more specific variant.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity as they accurately represent the nature of the vulnerability, with CWE-126 providing a precise description of the **buffer over-read** condition.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: While an incorrect calculation of buffer size could lead to a buffer over-read, the provided information does not specifically indicate this as the root cause.
