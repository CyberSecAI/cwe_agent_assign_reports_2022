## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-33044:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the improper handling of the "clientType" parameter during the "global.login" sequence in Dahua devices. Specifically, setting the "clientType" to "NetKeyboard" bypasses authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the normal authentication mechanism by manipulating the `clientType` parameter in the login request. The system incorrectly accepts the "NetKeyboard" client type, even when the device doesn't support this functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Dahua device.
*   **Full Control:** Once authenticated (or bypassed), an attacker can potentially gain complete control of the device, depending on the privileges associated with the default admin account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attack vector is remote, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network.
*   **Protocol:** The vulnerability is present in the DHIP and HTTP/HTTPS protocols used by Dahua devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network or have network access to the vulnerable Dahua device.
*   **No Credentials Needed:** The attacker does not need valid login credentials to exploit this specific vulnerability. The authentication bypass allows the attacker to effectively circumvent the need for credentials.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability is triggered by sending a "global.login" request with the "clientType" parameter set to "NetKeyboard". This is unexpected behavior, as devices not supporting this functionality should not allow authentication bypass.

Example of a vulnerable login request:
```json
{
    "method": "global.login",
    "params":
    {
        "userName": "admin",
        "loginType": "Direct",
        "clientType": "NetKeyboard",
        "authorityType": "Default",
        "passwordType": "Default",
        "password": "Not Used"
    },
    "id": 1,
    "session": 0
}
```

**Affected Devices:**
* IPC/VTH/VTO devices with firmware older than June 2021 that do not support "NetKeyboard" functionality are affected.

This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including the specific parameters needed to exploit the vulnerability and the vulnerable device types.

## CWE-287: Improper Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
AuthN: "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
AuthC: "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."
