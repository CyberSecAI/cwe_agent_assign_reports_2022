This type confusion then leads to the injection of unsanitized strings, ultimately resulting in **CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting)**. Therefore, CWE-843 can precede CWE-79.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe843[\"CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe843 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe843 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **type-confusion** (**CWE-843**), which allows unsanitized strings to be concatenated. Because the input is not properly validated, an attacker can pass in an array-like object instead of a string. This leads to the injection of unsanitized strings and ultimately results in Cross-Site Scripting (**CWE-79**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **CWE-843 (Type Confusion)** as the primary weakness because the vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation, leading to **type-confusion**. The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section clearly identifies the rootcause as \"**type-confusion**\". This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, leading to XSS (**CWE-79**). The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** also supports that the vulnerability stems from a **type confusion** issue in the `striptags` library due to a lack of input validation.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-843** is also influenced by the MITRE mapping guidance, which marks it as \"Allowed\" and at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nOther CWEs such as **CWE-79** are considered as the impact of the **type-confusion** that occurs.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description, combined with the retriever results and the MITRE mapping guidance, supports the selection of these CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
