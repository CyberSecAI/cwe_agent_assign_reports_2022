The password hashes are being disclosed which indicates that the passwords may be stored without proper encryption or hashing, effectively making them plaintext. |\n| CWE-522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate. Although the primary issue is the disclosure, this CWE covers the broader issue of how the credentials were not adequately protected in the first place. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the ChildOf relationship. CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials). This means that CWE-256 is a more specific case of CWE-522. Given that the vulnerability involves the disclosure of password hashes, indicating a potential lack of proper hashing or encryption, CWE-256 is a more precise classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the following steps:\n1.  The system stores or processes passwords without sufficient protection (e.g., no hashing, weak hashing). This is represented by **CWE-256** (Plaintext Storage of a Password), since the disclosure of password hashes suggest they are not securely stored.\n2.  During the registration process, the password hashes are disclosed due to a **WEAKNESS** in the system.\n3.  The disclosure of password hashes can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive application information, impacting confidentiality.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicate **insufficiently protected credentials** as the root cause. However, after reviewing the details, the disclosure of password hashes strongly suggests a lack of proper hashing or encryption, meaning the passwords might be stored in a form close to plaintext.\n\nThe **evidence** supporting this decision comes directly from the vulnerability description in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The Ypsomed mylife Cloud discloses password hashes during the registration process.\" This implies a failure to properly protect the passwords, leading to their disclosure in hash form, which is indicative of something close to plaintext storage.\n\nThe graph relationship analysis confirms that **CWE-256** is a more specific case of **CWE-522**. Therefore, **CWE-256** is at the optimal level of specificity. **CWE-522** is still relevant as it describes the broader category of the vulnerability, but **CWE-256** better represents the actual **ROOT CAUSE**.\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
