# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2021-27491

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The password hashes are being disclosed which indicates that the passwords may be stored without proper encryption or hashing, effectively making them plaintext. |
| CWE-522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate. Although the primary issue is the disclosure, this CWE covers the broader issue of how the credentials were not adequately protected in the first place. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the ChildOf relationship. CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials). This means that CWE-256 is a more specific case of CWE-522. Given that the vulnerability involves the disclosure of password hashes, indicating a potential lack of proper hashing or encryption, CWE-256 is a more precise classification.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain involves the following steps:
1.  The system stores or processes passwords without sufficient protection (e.g., no hashing, weak hashing). This is represented by **CWE-256** (Plaintext Storage of a Password), since the disclosure of password hashes suggest they are not securely stored.
2.  During the registration process, the password hashes are disclosed due to a **WEAKNESS** in the system.
3.  The disclosure of password hashes can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive application information, impacting confidentiality.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicate **insufficiently protected credentials** as the root cause. However, after reviewing the details, the disclosure of password hashes strongly suggests a lack of proper hashing or encryption, meaning the passwords might be stored in a form close to plaintext.

The **evidence** supporting this decision comes directly from the vulnerability description in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary: "The Ypsomed mylife Cloud discloses password hashes during the registration process." This implies a failure to properly protect the passwords, leading to their disclosure in hash form, which is indicative of something close to plaintext storage.

The graph relationship analysis confirms that **CWE-256** is a more specific case of **CWE-522**. Therefore, **CWE-256** is at the optimal level of specificity. **CWE-522** is still relevant as it describes the broader category of the vulnerability, but **CWE-256** better represents the actual **ROOT CAUSE**.
# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
