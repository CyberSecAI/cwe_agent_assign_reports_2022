It is a child of CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor), which is a Class level CWE. CWE-201 has peer relationships with CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) and CWE-202 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries). The relationships indicate that CWE-201 is the most specific and appropriate choice, representing the insertion of the secret key into the API output (sent data).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe202[\"CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe209\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe202\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe209,cwe202 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **credential leak** due to the insertion of the Azure Resource Manager's secret key into the JSON output of the API. This leads to exposure of sensitive information, potentially compromising data confidentiality, integrity, and system availability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is the most appropriate CWE. This is supported by the vulnerability description, which states a **credential leak** will expose Azure Resource Managers secret key through JSON of the API output.\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present\" is the \"Exposure of Azure Resource Manager's secret key through JSON of the API output.\"\nThe retriever results listed CWE-201 as the top match.\n\nThe relationship graph influenced the selection, confirming that CWE-201, being a Base level CWE and a child of the more general CWE-200, provides the right level of specificity. The mapping guidance for CWE-201 encourages its use when applicable because it is a Base level CWE.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because it is a more general class. While the vulnerability does result in information exposure, the root cause is specifically the insertion of sensitive information into sent data (API output), which is better represented by CWE-201.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
