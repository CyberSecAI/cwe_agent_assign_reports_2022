It has relationships to CWE-200 (Parent), CWE-209 (Peer), and CWE-202 (Peer). The relationships suggest that the vulnerability could also involve error messages (CWE-209) or data queries (CWE-202), but the provided information doesn't explicitly mention those. CWE-668 and CWE-863 are higher-level classes, making them less specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe202[\"CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe209\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe202\n    cwe668 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe209,cwe202,cwe668,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing access control** or **inconsistent visibility checks** in the `wikiconfig` API, leading to the **exposure of sensitive configuration data** which is then **inserted into sent data**. The root cause is the failure to properly restrict access to private configuration variables.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the exposure of private configuration variables as the core issue. The Retriever results suggested CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) as the top candidate, along with CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere).\n\nThe **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** mention the impact as \"leaked private config variables,\" and the **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** highlights the **root cause** as the API exposing sensitive configuration variables. This aligns well with CWE-201, as the private config variables are being inserted into the data sent by the API.\n\nCWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is a plausible secondary candidate since the private config variables are exposed to unauthorized users. However, it's a high-level class and thus less specific than CWE-201. Its mapping guidance explicitly discourages its use when lower-level CWEs are applicable.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is also a possible secondary candidate, as the API **fails to properly authorize** access to the private config variables. However, CWE-201 more directly describes the **weakness** of **inserting sensitive information** into the data being sent.\n\nThe decision to prioritize CWE-201 is based on its base-level abstraction, its direct relevance to the vulnerability description, and the mapping guidance favoring its use over higher-level classes.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
