There are no direct chain relationships apparent from the documentation. However, code injection could lead to further weaknesses and exploits. Also CWE-770 is in the same family as CWE-400 Resource exhaustion\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Resource Exhaustion\"]\n    \n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe770,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Code Injection** (CWE-94), where an attacker can inject malicious code into the system. This leads to a system restart, which implies a denial-of-service condition. A possible secondary weakness is allocation of resources without limits or throttling.\n  - Root Cause: **Code Injection** (CWE-94)\n  - Impact: System restart (Denial-of-Service) with a secondary weakness of a possible resource exhaustion issue.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the **Vulnerability Description** and **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** clearly point to **Code Injection**. The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** adds context, mentioning an OOM condition. Given the direct evidence of **Code Injection** from the vulnerability description, CWE-94 is the primary candidate. However, because **Code Injection** may lead to an OOM, which could cause a denial of service, CWE-770 is a candidate because it may be allocating resources without limits, or CWE-400 resource exhaustion.\n\n*   **CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')**\n    *   The vulnerability description explicitly states a **Code Injection** vulnerability.\n    *   CWE-94's description aligns with the product constructing a code segment using externally-influenced input without proper neutralization.\n    *   The impact of a system restart indicates the injected code can disrupt the system.\n    *   The retriever identifies this as the closest match at 0.130 score.\n    *   The mapping guidance is ALLOWED-WITH-REVIEW.\n*   **CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**\n    *   The vulnerability can cause OOM and lead to denial of service via system restart.\n    *   The description aligns with excessive resource allocation and lack of throttling controls.\n    *   This is not a direct result of the **code injection**, but rather a secondary effect.\n    *   The mapping guidance is ALLOWED\n\nBased on the evidence provided, CWE-94 is the most appropriate primary CWE due to the explicit mention of **code injection**. The connection between code injection and a system restart is more direct than allocation of resources without limits.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
