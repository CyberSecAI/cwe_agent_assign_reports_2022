This is a child of CWE-1230. The secondary CWEs CWE-425 and CWE-863 relate to **improper authorization** and access control issues. CWE-425 is a child of CWE-862, and CWE-863 is a child of CWE-285 and CWE-284. The relationship analysis highlights the importance of focusing on **improper authorization** when dealing with vulnerabilities involving access to sensitive information through search indexes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe612[\"CWE-612: Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe1230[\"CWE-1230: Improper Handling of Internal Data\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe612 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1230\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe612 primary\n    class cwe425,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of authorization** controls on the crafter-search component, leading to unauthenticated remote attackers being able to create, view, and delete search indexes. This directly relates to **improper authorization** and potentially **exposure of sensitive information**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards CWE-612 because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the ability to create, view, and delete search indexes without authentication. This indicates that the system **does not properly limit index access to actors who are authorized to see the original information.** The evidence supporting this is: \"Installations, where crafter-search is not protected, allow unauthenticated remote attackers to create, view, and delete search indexes.\"\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-612 with the highest dense score, reinforcing this assessment.\n\nCWE-425 and CWE-863 were considered as secondary CWEs because they are related to authorization issues, but they are less specific than CWE-612. The decision to prioritize CWE-612 is based on the vulnerability description's emphasis on the **improper authorization** of search indexes.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the **lack of proper authorization** controls on the search indexes.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-612: Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a search index of private or sensitive documents, but it does not properly limit index access to actors who are authorized to see the original information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
