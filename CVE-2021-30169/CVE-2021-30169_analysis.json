This parent-child relationship indicates that CWE-256 is a more specific case of insufficiently protected credentials. The relationship influences the decision to select CWE-256 because it is more precise and directly reflects the **root cause** described in the vulnerability. There are no chain relationships applicable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause**, which is the **unprotected storage of sensitive information**. This leads to the impact of attackers being able to retrieve user credentials, which allows them to unauthentically grant users credentials.\nRoot Cause: **Unprotected storage of sensitive information** (CWE-256).\nImpact: Unauthorized access and control due to credential retrieval.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified several potential CWEs, including CWE-522, CWE-319, CWE-256, and CWE-798. However, after a more detailed analysis of the vulnerability description and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" the most accurate mapping is CWE-256. The vulnerability's **root cause** is the storage of user credentials in HTML format with base64 encoding, which is equivalent to **plaintext storage of a password**. This is supported by the following evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\":\n\n*   \"The root cause is the storage of user credentials in HTML format (`/new/setup.htm`) with base64 encoding, making them easily retrievable.\"\n*   \"**Cleartext Storage of Credentials:** Usernames and passwords are not securely stored, as they are just base64 encoded in the HTML source of `/new/setup.htm`.\"\n*   \"Attackers can retrieve the base64 encoded admin credentials. These can then be decoded, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control of the affected IP camera.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-256 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause**. While CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is a broader category, CWE-256 specifically highlights the issue of plaintext storage. The retriever results also list CWE-256 as a candidate, lending further support to this decision. The confidence in this mapping is high (0.9) due to the clear evidence in the vulnerability description and supporting documentation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
