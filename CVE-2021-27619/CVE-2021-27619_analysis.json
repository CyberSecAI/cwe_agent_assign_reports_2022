CWE-202 is a child of CWE-1230 (Improper Handling of Data Queries), indicating that the vulnerability stems from how data queries are managed. CWE-612 (Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information) is also a child of CWE-1230, suggesting a close relationship. While CWE-612 is more specific to search indexes, the vulnerability description focuses on the exposure of sensitive information through iterative searching rather than an authorization issue with the index itself, thus making CWE-202 the more appropriate primary classification. The hierarchical relationship highlights that the core issue is related to how data queries expose sensitive information, and authorization is a contributing factor.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe202[\"CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\"]\n    cwe612[\"CWE-612: Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe1230[\"CWE-1230: Improper Handling of Data Queries\"]\n    \n    cwe202 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1230\n    cwe612 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1230\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe202 primary\n    class cwe612 secondary\n    class cwe1230 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **IMPROPER** handling of search queries. The **LOW PRIVILEGED USER** can iteratively search for attributes not meant for them. Although results are masked, the iterative searching lets the user determine the attribute values. This ultimately leads to **INFORMATION DISCLOSURE**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the retriever results. The description clearly states that a **LOW PRIVILEGED USER** can iteratively search for attributes, eventually leading to **INFORMATION DISCLOSURE**. This aligns strongly with CWE-202 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries).\n\nThe provided evidence from the vulnerability description: \"allows a low privileged user to search for attributes which are not supposed to be displayed to them. Although the search results are masked, the user can iteratively enter one character at a time to search and determine the masked attribute value thereby leading to information disclosure.\"\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-202 as the top combined result, further supporting this classification.\n\nCWE-612 (Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information) was considered due to its relevance to search indexes. However, the vulnerability description emphasizes the information exposure through iterative searching rather than an authorization flaw within the index itself. Therefore, CWE-202 is the more accurate primary classification as it directly addresses the **EXPOSURE** aspect.\n\nCWE-202 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred for mapping root causes, and it accurately represents the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product searches for critical resources using an externally-supplied search path that can point to resources that are not under the product's direct control.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
