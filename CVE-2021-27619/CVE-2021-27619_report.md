## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-202 | Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-612 | Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-202, which is a Base level CWE related to exposure of sensitive information. CWE-202 is a child of CWE-1230 (Improper Handling of Data Queries), indicating that the vulnerability stems from how data queries are managed. CWE-612 (Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information) is also a child of CWE-1230, suggesting a close relationship. While CWE-612 is more specific to search indexes, the vulnerability description focuses on the exposure of sensitive information through iterative searching rather than an authorization issue with the index itself, thus making CWE-202 the more appropriate primary classification. The hierarchical relationship highlights that the core issue is related to how data queries expose sensitive information, and authorization is a contributing factor.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **IMPROPER** handling of search queries. The **LOW PRIVILEGED USER** can iteratively search for attributes not meant for them. Although results are masked, the iterative searching lets the user determine the attribute values. This ultimately leads to **INFORMATION DISCLOSURE**.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the retriever results. The description clearly states that a **LOW PRIVILEGED USER** can iteratively search for attributes, eventually leading to **INFORMATION DISCLOSURE**. This aligns strongly with CWE-202 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries).

The provided evidence from the vulnerability description: "allows a low privileged user to search for attributes which are not supposed to be displayed to them. Although the search results are masked, the user can iteratively enter one character at a time to search and determine the masked attribute value thereby leading to information disclosure."

The retriever results also list CWE-202 as the top combined result, further supporting this classification.

CWE-612 (Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information) was considered due to its relevance to search indexes. However, the vulnerability description emphasizes the information exposure through iterative searching rather than an authorization flaw within the index itself. Therefore, CWE-202 is the more accurate primary classification as it directly addresses the **EXPOSURE** aspect.

CWE-202 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred for mapping root causes, and it accurately represents the weakness.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product searches for critical resources using an externally-supplied search path that can point to resources that are not under the product's direct control.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product imports, requires, or includes executable functionality (such as a library) from a source that is outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
