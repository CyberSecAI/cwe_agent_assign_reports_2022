It has a parent in CWE-203 (Information Exposure). CWE-346 (Origin Validation Error) and CWE-451 (User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information) were considered as secondary candidates, as the vulnerability involves leaking cross-origin data.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe204[\"CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Information Exposure\"]\n    cwe346[\"CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\"]\n    cwe451[\"CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\"]\n\n    cwe204 -->|CHILDOF| cwe203\n    cwe346 -- PeerOf --> cwe451\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe204 primary\n    class cwe346,cwe451 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **inappropriate implementation** in the Background Fetch API, which leads to a leak of cross-origin data. This can be mapped as: **Inappropriate Implementation** -> CWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy) -> Information Disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description, points to a problem in the Background Fetch API implementation that allows leaking cross-origin data.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-204 is present in the description: \"allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page\". This indicates that different responses can be observed by the attacker, revealing internal state information.\n\nCWE-346 and CWE-451 were considered because the vulnerability involves cross-origin data and a crafted HTML page, which could potentially involve origin validation issues or UI misrepresentation. However, the core issue seems to be the observable discrepancy in the response that allows data leakage, making CWE-204 the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nThe selection of CWE-204 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the observable discrepancy leading to information exposure.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
