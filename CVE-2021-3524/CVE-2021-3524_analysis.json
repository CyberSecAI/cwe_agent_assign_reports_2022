CWE-113 [Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')] is a variant of CWE-93. The vulnerability involves the **injection** of HTTP headers via a newline character in the CORS ExposeHeader tag.

This is because the root cause is the improper handling of CRLF sequences in the ExposeHeader tag.\n\nCWE-113 [Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')] is also relevant because the vulnerability specifically involves HTTP headers. However, since the root cause is the CRLF injection itself, CWE-93 is the more appropriate primary CWE.\n\nCWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is a potential impact of the vulnerability, as an attacker could inject arbitrary headers, such as 'Set-Cookie', leading to potential XSS attacks. However, it is not the root cause.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-93 directly addresses the **improper neutralization** of CRLF sequences, which is the root cause of the vulnerability. It is a Base level CWE which is preferred.\n\nThe retriever scores also support this analysis, with CWE-93 having the highest score.",
