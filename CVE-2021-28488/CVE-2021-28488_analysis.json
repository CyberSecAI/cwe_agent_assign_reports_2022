CWE-285 represents a higher-level categorization of authorization issues, while CWE-863 specifically addresses cases where an authorization check is performed but is done incorrectly. CWE-668, Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere, is also considered due to the potential for unintended access to managed-network data, but it is a more general class.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|PEEROF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect access-control behavior** (CWE-863), leading to the impact of being able to retrieve managed-network data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis centers on the **incorrect access-control behavior** in the Ericsson Network Manager. The description clearly states that \"Users in the same AMOS authorization group can retrieve managed-network data that was not set to be accessible to the entire group.\" This points to an authorization issue, specifically that the authorization check is not correctly performed.\n\nCWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, is selected as the primary CWE because it best fits the described scenario. The software performs an authorization check, but it is **incorrect**. The other CWEs were considered, but not chosen as the primary because they are either too general (CWE-285, Improper Authorization) or focus on a different aspect of the vulnerability (CWE-668, Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere).\n\nThe decision is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description, specifically the phrase \"**incorrect access-control behavior**\". This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-863, which involves an authorization check that is not correctly performed.\n\nThe CWE selection is at the optimal level of specificity because it captures the core issue of the vulnerability \u2013 the authorization check itself is flawed.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 11172.24\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 11239.89\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead.
