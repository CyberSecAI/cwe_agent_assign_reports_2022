This is a variant level CWE which is preferred. CWE-416 is a child of CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference) and CWE-672 (Operation on Resource after Expiration). CWE-416 can be preceded by CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size) and CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe120 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    cwe123 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe416\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe825,cwe672,cwe120,cwe123 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **use after free** (CWE-416) in the File System API of Google Chrome. This **rootcause** allows a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption and potentially execute arbitrary code via a crafted HTML page.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, the key phrases, and the CVE reference links content summary, all of which point to **use after free** as the root cause. The primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions is CWE-416, further supporting this classification. The retriever results also list CWE-416 as the top combined result.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"**use after free** in File System API... allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption...\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating the **root_cause** and **weakness** is \"**Use after free**\".\n\nCWE-416 is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is preferred. Given the strong evidence and clear alignment with the CWE description, CWE-416 is the most appropriate classification.",
