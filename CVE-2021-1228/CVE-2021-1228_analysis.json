CWE-1317 is a more specific case of improper access control related to fabric bridges. CWE-284 is a high-level `Pillar` and is `Discouraged` from use.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1317[\"CWE-1317: Improper Access Control in Fabric Bridge\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe1317 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1317 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events for this vulnerability is:\n1.  **Insufficient security requirements** (CWE-1317) during LLDP setup.\n2.  Attacker sends a crafted LLDP packet.\n3.  Security validations are bypassed.\n4.  Unauthorized server connects to the infrastructure VLAN.\n5.  Attacker gains unauthorized connections to APIC services or joins other host endpoints.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **insufficient security requirements** during the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) setup phase as the root cause. The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass security validations and connect an unauthorized server to the infrastructure VLAN.\n\nThe retriever results suggested CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), CWE-346 (Origin Validation Error), and CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input), among others. However, considering the detailed description and the provided CVE Reference Links Content Summary, CWE-1317 (Improper Access Control in Fabric Bridge) is the most appropriate.\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-1317 is derived from:\n\n*   Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**rootcause:** **insufficient security requirements**\"\n*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The vulnerability is due to **insufficient security requirements** during the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) setup phase of the infrastructure VLAN.\"\n\nCWE-1317 accurately represents the weakness because it specifically addresses improper access control within a fabric bridge, which aligns with the vulnerability's focus on the fabric infrastructure VLAN connection establishment. While CWE-284 is a broader category, CWE-1317 provides a more precise classification.\n\nCWE-284 was considered but not chosen as the primary CWE because it is a high-level `Pillar` and `Discouraged`. The mapping guidance suggests using more specific descendants when available.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
