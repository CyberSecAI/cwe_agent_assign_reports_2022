CWE-266 is a child of the Class-level CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management). Other considered CWEs, such as CWE-842 and CWE-276 are also at the Base level and provide alternative perspectives on the root cause. These relationships help to ensure the selected CWE is at the appropriate level of specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe842[\"CWE-842: Placement of User into Incorrect Group\"]\n    cwe276[\"CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\"]\n\n    cwe266 -->|CHILDOF| cwe269\n    cwe842 -->|PEEROF| cwe266\n    cwe276 -->|PEEROF| cwe266\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe842,cwe276 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect initialization of supplemental groups** in sshd. This leads to helper programs inheriting the privileges of the sshd process instead of the intended user, ultimately resulting in privilege escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focuses on the **incorrect initialization of supplemental groups** as the root cause, leading to privilege escalation. The analysis relies heavily on the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", specifically: \"**supplemental groups are not initialized as expected**\" and \"sshd fails to correctly initialize supplemental groups when executing commands using AuthorizedKeysCommand or AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand with a different user specified, inheriting sshd process groups instead.\"\n\nCWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) is selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause where the software **incorrectly assigns privileges** (group memberships) to a process. This is supported by the retriever results and the detailed description of CWE-266, which states: \"A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\"\n\nCWE-842 (Placement of User into Incorrect Group) was considered as a secondary CWE, since the root cause is **supplemental groups are not initialized as expected**, but ultimately this is about group membership so it is a candidate.\n\nCWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions) was also considered as a secondary CWE, but deemed less appropriate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-266 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) and is supported by the evidence and mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
