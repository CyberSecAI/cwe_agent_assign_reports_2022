CWE-798 [CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials] itself is a Base CWE. The relationship indicates that CWE-259 [CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password] is a more specific instance of CWE-798 [CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials], focusing on the use of hard-coded passwords specifically, as opposed to other types of hard-coded credentials (e.g., cryptographic keys). CWE-321 [CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key] is a PeerOf to CWE-259 [CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password], showing that both relate to hardcoded secrets, but one is for passwords, the other for keys.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe259 -- PEEROF --> cwe321\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe259 primary\n    class cwe798,cwe321 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the **hard-coded password** (CWE-259 [CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password]), leading to unauthorized access and ultimately allowing an attacker to take control of the merging unit.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment based on the vulnerability description and key phrases strongly points to CWE-259 [CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password] as the primary weakness.
