This is a Class-level CWE. CWE-863 is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). Since physical access is required, CWE-1263, Improper Physical Access Control, a child of CWE-284, is also considered. CWE-1263 is a peer of CWE-1191 (On-Chip Debug and Test Interface With Improper Access Control).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe1263[\"CWE-1263: Improper Physical Access Control\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe1263 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe1263 secondary\n    class cwe284,cwe285 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper permissions logic**, leading to an attacker with physical access being able to see private contact information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates that the root cause is **improper permissions logic**, which allows an attacker with physical access to view private contact information. The **rootcause** phrase strongly suggests an authorization issue.\n\nThe vulnerability description key phrases and CVE Reference Links Content Summary both point to **improper permissions logic**.\n\nThe Retriever Results show CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-1263 (Improper Physical Access Control) as relevant.\n\nCWE-863: Incorrect Authorization is a Class-level CWE that describes a scenario where the product performs an authorization check, but it is performed incorrectly. The vulnerability states the **improper permissions logic** directly aligns with this CWE.\n\nCWE-1263: Improper Physical Access Control describes a scenario where the product does not sufficiently protect against an unauthorized actor with physical access to restricted information. Since the attacker requires physical access, this CWE is relevant.\n\nWhile CWE-863 is a Class-level CWE, it is more specific than the Pillar-level CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). Using the guidance to select a more specific child CWE, CWE-863 is chosen as the primary CWE, and CWE-1263 is chosen as the secondary CWE due to the physical access requirement.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization), CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) were considered but not selected as the primary CWE. CWE-285 and CWE-284 are too high level, and the provided evidence does not point to input validation issues.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:",
