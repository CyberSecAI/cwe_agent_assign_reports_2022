# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2021-36077

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-787, is a base-level CWE which is appropriate. CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119, which represents the broader class of improper restrictions of operations within memory buffers. The secondary CWE considered, CWE-1284, can precede CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value). The relationships illustrate the flow from input to memory allocation and potential exploitation.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure handling** of a malicious SVG file leading to **memory corruption**. This leads to an out-of-bounds write, resulting in a local application denial of service.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis indicates that the primary weakness is an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) caused by **insecure handling** of a malicious SVG file, resulting in memory corruption and denial of service.

The evidence supporting this is:

*   The vulnerability description mentions **memory corruption** due to **insecure handling** of a malicious SVG file.
*   The CVE reference links content summary explicitly states that the root cause is "Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer (CWE-788)" and lists "Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)" as a cause of other vulnerabilities.
*   Retriever results list CWE-787 as the top candidate with a score of 1.000.
*   The CVSS vector specifies a local attack vector with user interaction required, consistent with a malicious file needing to be opened.

Based on the retriever results and the CVE reference links, CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is the most appropriate primary CWE. The vulnerability involves writing data past the intended buffer due to **insecure handling**, leading to **memory corruption** and denial of service.

CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) was considered as a secondary CWE, given that SVG files may contain size or length parameters that, if not properly validated, could lead to memory allocation issues. While this could be a contributing factor, the primary issue is the out-of-bounds write itself. The evidence for this secondary CWE is weaker, hence the lower confidence score.

CWE-788 (Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer) was also considered, but since the vulnerability involves writing past the end of the buffer, CWE-787 is more specific and appropriate.
