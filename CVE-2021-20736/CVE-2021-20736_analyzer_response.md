# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2021-20736

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-943 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic | 1.0 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-943, is a Class-level weakness, while the secondary CWE, CWE-89, is a Base-level weakness and a ChildOf CWE-943. This parent-child relationship indicates that CWE-89 is a more specific type of CWE-943. However, the vulnerability description specifically mentions "NoSQL injection," making CWE-943 a more direct match, as it encompasses various data query languages beyond SQL.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with **improper input sanitization**, leading to a **NoSQL injection** vulnerability, which ultimately results in information disclosure and modification.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, CWE-89 was considered due to its high retriever score and the term "injection." However, the vulnerability description explicitly states "NoSQL injection." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also indicates "CWE-943 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic)". Therefore, CWE-943 is the most appropriate primary CWE.

CWE-89 is retained as a secondary candidate because SQL injection is a well-known type of injection, and the general principles of injection apply across different query languages. However, the specific vulnerability targets NoSQL databases, making CWE-943 more accurate.

The decision is primarily based on the following evidence:

*   Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: "**rootcause:** **improper input sanitization**", "**weakness:** **NoSQL injection**"
*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: `"Weaknesses": [ "CWE-943 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic)" ]`

CWE-943 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately reflects the root cause and encompasses the broader category of data query languages beyond just SQL.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product acts as an intermediary HTTP agent
         (such as a proxy or firewall) in the data flow between two
         entities such as a client and server, but it does not
         interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that
         are consistent with how the messages will be processed by
         those entities that are at the ultimate destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-162: Improper Neutralization of Trailing Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes trailing special elements that could be interpreted in unexpected ways when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-436: Interpretation Conflict
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Product A handles inputs or steps differently than Product B, which causes A to perform incorrect actions based on its perception of B's state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a
