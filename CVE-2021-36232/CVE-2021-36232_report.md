# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-36232

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-285 | Improper Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the selection was the parent-child relationship between CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). Since the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary explicitly state that there is a **missing authorization** check, CWE-862 is more specific and therefore more appropriate than its parent, CWE-285. While both are Class level, CWE-862's description aligns more closely with the described weakness.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check, leading to the ability for an authenticated attacker to escalate privileges and access sensitive information.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Improper Authorization**" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates that the root cause is a **missing authorization** check. The Retriever Results listed several relevant CWEs, including CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization).

The decision to prioritize CWE-862 over CWE-285 and CWE-863 was based on the explicit mention of a **missing authorization** check in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary.
> *"The root cause is a missing authorization check in the MIK.starlight Server. The server fails to verify if a user has the necessary privileges to perform certain actions."*

This direct evidence supports the selection of CWE-862 as the primary CWE. While CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is a broader category, CWE-862 provides a more precise description of the vulnerability. The relationship analysis further supports this decision, as CWE-862 is a child of CWE-285, representing a more specific type of authorization failure.

CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered but not selected because the evidence indicates that the authorization check is **missing**, not incorrectly performed.

The final decision is based on the available evidence, relationship analysis, and mapping guidance, leading to the selection of CWE-862 as the primary CWE, representing the most accurate and specific classification of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* The vulnerability is not about relying on untrusted inputs, but rather the **absence** of authorization checks.

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.

*Not Selected:* While privilege escalation is the impact, the root cause is the **missing authorization**, not the handling of insufficient privileges.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability doesn't involve externally controlled immutable parameters.

## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This CWE is too broad and doesn't specifically address the **missing authorization** check.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

*Not Selected:* While technically resources are exposed to the wrong sphere, the root cause is more accurately described as a **missing authorization** check.

## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges 
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* Similar to CWE-274, while the impact involves privileges, the root cause is the **missing authorization** check.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This CWE is irrelevant as the vulnerability doesn't involve path equivalence issues.

## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* The vulnerability is due to a **missing authorization** check, not insufficient granularity.

## CWE-291: Reliance on IP Address for Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an IP address for authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction
