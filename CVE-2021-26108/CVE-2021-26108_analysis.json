The vulnerability description specifically mentions a \"hard-coded cryptographic key\", making CWE-321 a more precise and appropriate classification than its parent.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Use of a hard-coded cryptographic key** (CWE-321)\n2.  **Impact:** An attacker can retrieve the key, leading to potential information disclosure and unauthorized access by decrypting SSLVPN cookies.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis clearly pointed to CWE-321 as the most suitable classification due to the explicit mention of a \"hard-coded cryptographic key\" in the vulnerability description. The retriever results also ranked CWE-321 as the top candidate. The relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-321 is a more specific variant of CWE-798, making it the preferred choice.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is:\n- \"A **use of hard-coded cryptographic key** vulnerability in the SSLVPN of FortiOS before 7.0.1 may allow an attacker to retrieve the key by reverse engineering.\"\n- \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the **use of a hardcoded cryptographic key** for SSLVPN cookie encryption within FortiOS.\"\n- \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the presence of a hardcoded cryptographic key, which is a violation of secure coding practices. This falls under CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key).\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-321 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.",
