CWE-917 (Expression Language Injection) is a peer of CWE-1336, suggesting they are related but distinct injection types. The vulnerability involves server-side template injection via bean validation, making CWE-1336 a more direct fit, while CWE-917 covers the specific expression language aspect. Both are at the Base abstraction level, which is preferred.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe917[\"CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe917 -->|PEEROF| cwe1336\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1336 primary\n    class cwe917 secondary\n    class cwe94 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper configuration** of the Bean Validation framework, leading to **server-side template injection**. This allows an attacker to inject malicious EL expressions, resulting in pre-authentication remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **server side template injection** as the primary **weakness**, supported by the CVE description highlighting the improper handling of EL expressions in the Bean Validation framework. The vulnerability description key phrases also point to the **server side template injection**.\n\nThe evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section clearly indicates that the **root cause** is the **improper configuration** of the Bean Validation framework allowing EL interpolation. Specifically, \"...EL (Expression Language) interpolation was disabled in most parts of the application...it was still enabled within the Jersey REST framework...This allowed an attacker to inject malicious EL expressions through unexpected query parameters.\"\n\nCWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) is the most appropriate CWE because it directly addresses the **server-side template injection** **weakness**. The vulnerability involves the use of a template engine (Bean Validation framework), and the application **fails to neutralize special elements**, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.\n\nCWE-917 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')) is considered a secondary candidate because the vulnerability involves the use of an expression language (EL) within the template engine. However, CWE-1336 is a more direct match as it focuses on the template engine aspect.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1336 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it is a Base-level CWE that accurately reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability. It is more specific than a Class-level CWE like CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')), which is too general.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
