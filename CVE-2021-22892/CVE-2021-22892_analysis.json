CWE-203 is a more specific, base-level weakness that falls under the broader class of CWE-200. The Observable Discrepancy (CWE-203) accurately captures the vulnerability where the server's different responses reveal internal state, leading to information exposure. The choice of CWE-203 over CWE-200 was based on the principle of selecting the most specific CWE that fits the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe203 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe203 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the following steps:\n1.  The server uses different responses based on whether an email address is valid.\n2.  An attacker can observe these response discrepancies.\n3.  This allows the attacker to enumerate and validate email addresses, leading to information disclosure.\nThe root cause is the observable discrepancy, leading to the impact of information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the information disclosure vulnerability. The key phrase \"allowed email addresses to be disclosed by enumeration and validation checks\" points to a weakness where different responses reveal information about the validity of email addresses.\n\nThe Retriever Results suggested several CWEs, including CWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy) and CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor). While CWE-200 is a common choice for information disclosure vulnerabilities, it is often misused and represents a technical impact rather than a root cause. The MITRE mapping guidance discourages using CWE-200 when more specific options are available.\n\nCWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy) was selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause: the server's different responses reveal internal state information to unauthorized actors. This aligns with the vulnerability description, which states that email addresses are disclosed through enumeration and validation checks based on these discrepancies.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-203 is based on the following evidence:\n*   The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"enumeration and validation checks,\" indicating an attempt to determine the validity of email addresses.\n*   The different responses from the server based on the validity of email addresses fit the definition of \"observable discrepancy.\"\n*   CWE-203 is a base-level CWE, which is preferred for mapping to root causes.\nThe confidence level is high (0.8) because the evidence directly supports the selection of CWE-203. CWE-200 is included as a secondary CWE with a lower confidence (0.5) because it represents the impact of the vulnerability, but is not the primary root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.085\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n**Usage:** Allowed\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.065\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.064\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
