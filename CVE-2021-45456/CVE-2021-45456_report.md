## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.00 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.75 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the ChildOf relationship between CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) and CWE-77 (Command Injection). CWE-78 is more specific to OS commands, making it a better fit than CWE-77. Additionally, CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) can precede CWE-78, indicating a potential chain where **improper input validation** leads to command injection. The base level of CWE-78 provides the appropriate level of detail for this vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with **improper input validation**, where the system **fails to properly validate** the project name. This leads to the construction of an OS command with a maliciously crafted project name, resulting in **OS command injection**.
  - **Root Cause:** **Improper Input Validation**
  - **Weakness:** **OS Command Injection**
  - **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server.

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, both CWE-77 and CWE-78 seemed like strong candidates due to the presence of a **command injection** vulnerability. However, CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command) was chosen as the primary CWE because the vulnerability specifically involves the execution of OS commands. This is supported by the vulnerability description, which mentions that an illegal project name can "pass the check and perform the following steps, resulting in a **command injection** vulnerability." The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that "successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the server."

CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was considered as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability stems from a mismatch between what is checked and what is used, indicating **improper input validation**. The vulnerability description key phrases also highlight **improper input validation** as a root cause.

The final selection of CWE-78 and CWE-20 provides a comprehensive view of the vulnerability, capturing both the specific type of command injection and the underlying cause.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-115: Misinterpretation of Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product misinterprets an input, whether from an attacker or another product, in a security-relevant fashion.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a query intended to access or manipulate data in a data store such as a database, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended logic of the query.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
