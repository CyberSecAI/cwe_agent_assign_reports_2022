CWE-639, Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key, is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-863. The relationship signifies that CWE-639 is a more specific case of CWE-863.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper permission check** which leads to an authenticated user being able to publish draft records of other users via REST API calls.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified that the vulnerability lies in the **incorrect authorization**, specifically in the `publish()` method of the `invenio-drafts-resources` service. The provided evidence states that the record being published was not passed to the permission check function (`self.require_permission`).\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) because the product performs an authorization check, but **does not properly check permissions** when a record is published. This aligns with the description of CWE-863, which states, \"The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\"\n\nCWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) was also considered because an authenticated user is able to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier. This suggests a potential bypass through a user-controlled key (the record identifier). However, CWE-639 is a more specific case that involves modifying the key value, and the vulnerability description doesn't explicitly state that the user is *modifying* the key, only that they need to *know* it. Thus, CWE-639 is marked as a secondary candidate.\n\nThe final decision to prioritize CWE-863 as the primary CWE is based on the root cause as identified in the vulnerability description key phrases: \"**does not properly check permissions**\". This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-863.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used:** This CWE focuses on the reuse of resources without clearing sensitive information, which is not the primary issue in the vulnerability description. The vulnerability is about **improper permission checks**, not the handling of sensitive information within resources.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n**Why Not Used:** Although this could be a consequence of the **improper permission check**, it's too high-level. The core issue is the **lack of proper authorization**, not the general exposure of a resource.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used:** This CWE is about the placement of sensitive information, which is not relevant to the vulnerability. The issue is about **improper authorization**, not the mishandling of sensitive information.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used:** This CWE focuses on system-level information exposure, which is not the primary issue. The vulnerability is about **improper authorization** to publish records.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Why Not Used:** This CWE is about resource management, which is not related to the described vulnerability. The core issue is **improper permission checks**.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used:** The vulnerability is about **improper authorization**, not the mishandling of sensitive information before storage or transfer.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Used as Secondary:** While not the primary cause, this is a potential contributing factor. The authenticated user needs to know the record identifier to exploit the vulnerability, suggesting a potential bypass through a user-controlled key. However, the description doesn't explicitly state that the user is *modifying* the key, only that they need to *know* it.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used:** This CWE is about file access, which is not directly related to the described vulnerability. The core issue is **improper",
