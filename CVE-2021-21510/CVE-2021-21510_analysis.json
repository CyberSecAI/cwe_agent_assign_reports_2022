It can precede CWE-79 (Cross-Site Scripting), meaning that HTTP Request/Response Splitting can lead to XSS. The secondary CWE is CWE-74, which is a Class and a parent of CWE-113.

This can then lead to web-cache poisoning or trigger redirections.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) was considered due to the **host header injection** vulnerability. However, CWE-113 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')) is a more specific variant that better describes the **lack of proper input sanitization of the \"Host\" header**. The **\"Host header injection\"** vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary values into the Host header, potentially leading to web-cache poisoning or triggering redirects.\n\nThe analysis relies heavily on the provided **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** and **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**, specifically the root cause information about the **lack of proper sanitization of the Host header**.\n\nCWE-113 is chosen because it is at the Variant level of abstraction, providing a more precise characterization of the vulnerability than the more general Class CWE-74.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 9128.92\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-230: Improper Handling of Missing Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.191\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when a parameter, field, or argument name is specified, but the associated value is missing, i.e. it is empty, blank, or null.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 9076.03\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.190\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThis attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.",
