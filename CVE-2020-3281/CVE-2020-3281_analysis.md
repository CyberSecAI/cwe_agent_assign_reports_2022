# Analysis for CVE-2020-3281

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. **Storage of unencrypted credentials** is the root cause. |
| CWE-532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | The **unencrypted credentials** are stored in the audit log. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-312, which describes the root cause: **storage of unencrypted credentials**. CWE-532 is a related weakness, since the **unencrypted sensitive information** is specifically written to a log file.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **storage of unencrypted credentials (CWE-312)** in the audit logs. This leads to the **insertion of sensitive information into a log file (CWE-532)**, which can be accessed by an authenticated remote attacker. The impact is that the attacker can view sensitive information in clear text and potentially use those credentials to discover and manage network devices.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment correctly identifies the primary weakness as CWE-312, which is the **storage of unencrypted credentials**. The vulnerability description clearly states that the **root cause** is the **storage of certain unencrypted credentials**. The impact is that an attacker can view sensitive information in clear text by accessing the audit logs.

The retriever results also suggest CWE-532, which is the **insertion of sensitive information into a log file**. This is a relevant weakness because the **unencrypted credentials** are stored in the audit logs. CWE-532 is a child of CWE-200 (Information Exposure), and also a child of CWE-538 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory) The weakness can be described as an authenticated remote attacker accessing the audit logs and obtaining credentials that they may not normally have access to.

The final decision is to map CWE-312 as the primary weakness and CWE-532 as a secondary weakness. This mapping accurately reflects the **root cause** and the specific context of the vulnerability. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred for root cause analysis. The confidence in this mapping is high because it is based on clear evidence from the vulnerability description and the retriever results.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users. In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders. If a system administrator can recover a password directly, or use a brute force search on the available information, the administrator can use the password on other accounts.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
