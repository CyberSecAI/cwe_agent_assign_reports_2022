CWE-532 is a related weakness, since the **unencrypted sensitive information** is specifically written to a log file.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe312\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe532 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **storage of unencrypted credentials (CWE-312)** in the audit logs. This leads to the **insertion of sensitive information into a log file (CWE-532)**, which can be accessed by an authenticated remote attacker. The impact is that the attacker can view sensitive information in clear text and potentially use those credentials to discover and manage network devices.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment correctly identifies the primary weakness as CWE-312, which is the **storage of unencrypted credentials**. The vulnerability description clearly states that the **root cause** is the **storage of certain unencrypted credentials**. The impact is that an attacker can view sensitive information in clear text by accessing the audit logs.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest CWE-532, which is the **insertion of sensitive information into a log file**. This is a relevant weakness because the **unencrypted credentials** are stored in the audit logs. CWE-532 is a child of CWE-200 (Information Exposure), and also a child of CWE-538 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory) The weakness can be described as an authenticated remote attacker accessing the audit logs and obtaining credentials that they may not normally have access to.\n\nThe final decision is to map CWE-312 as the primary weakness and CWE-532 as a secondary weakness. This mapping accurately reflects the **root cause** and the specific context of the vulnerability. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred for root cause analysis. The confidence in this mapping is high because it is based on clear evidence from the vulnerability description and the retriever results.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users. In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders.
