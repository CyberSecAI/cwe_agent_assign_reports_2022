The **HTTP method spoofing** aids in CSRF attacks, which would otherwise not be possible. |\n| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE.

This weakness directly enables other issues, such as CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a class-level CWE that represents a broader category of authorization failures, and while applicable, it is less specific than CWE-290.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe290[\"CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe290 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe352\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe290 primary\n    class cwe352,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **HTTP method spoofing** (**weakness**). The server **fails to properly** validate the HTTP method, leading to an **incorrect authorization**. This, in turn, enables Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, ultimately allowing attackers to change the server state.\n  - **Root Cause:** **HTTP method spoofing** (**weakness:** **HTTP method spoofing**)\n  - **Weakness:** **Incorrect Authorization** (The system **fails to properly** validate the HTTP method)\n  - **Impact:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and ability to change the server state.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **HTTP method spoofing** vulnerability, considering its impact on authorization and potential for CSRF attacks. The final selection prioritizes CWE-290 because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability - the **failure to properly** validate the HTTP method, leading to **authentication bypass**. CWE-352 is included because the **HTTP method spoofing** aids in CSRF attacks. The assessment relies on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and CVE reference links, particularly the emphasis on how **HTTP method spoofing** bypasses intended restrictions and aids CSRF attacks.\n\nRelevant excerpts:\n- \"allows **HTTP method spoofing**, allowing to change the assumed HTTP method via URL parameter.\"\n- \"This bypasses restrictions otherwise put on these types of requests and aids in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, which would otherwise not be possible.\"\n\nThe CWEs are selected at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-290 is a base-level CWE that directly describes the **authentication bypass** due to **HTTP method spoofing**.\nThe Retriever Results and graph relationships support this decision.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nAnalysis: This CWE is related because the application relies on the HTTP method (an input) for security decisions, but it can be modified by an attacker.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nAnalysis: This CWE is less relevant because it focuses on modifying a key value to access another user's data, while this vulnerability allows changing the HTTP method to bypass restrictions.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nAnalysis: This CWE is not directly applicable because the vulnerability is not related to incorrect implementation of a specific authentication algorithm, but rather to the **failure to validate** the HTTP method.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nAnalysis: This CWE is related because the HTTP method is assumed to be immutable, but it can be externally controlled via a URL parameter.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
