The retriever results showed several candidates, with CWE-862 being a top contender, although a Class-level CWE suggests reviewing its children for a better fit. CWE-862 is a child of CWE-285 **Improper Authorization** and CWE-284 **Improper Access Control**. Due to the **missing user check**, and the resulting impact of populating other users' credentials, a child of CWE-862 does not seem to be a better fit. The credentials are being exposed to the wrong sphere, so CWE-668 is also considered, although it is high-level as well.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n    class cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing user check**, leading to the population of other users' credentials, and ultimately resulting in potential unauthorized access to external storage.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Missing user check** (CWE-862)\n  - **Weakness:** Incorrect population of credentials\n  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external storage\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description, CVE reference links, and retriever results. The key phrase \"missing user check\" and the impact of populating other users' credentials strongly suggest CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** as the primary weakness.\n\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary states:\n\"The provided content indicates that CVE-2021-22877 is related to a vulnerability in Nextcloud where stored credentials could be accessed by other users...The fix involves verifying if user is logged in via  `\\\\OC::$server->getUserSession()->isLoggedIn()` to avoid pre-populating the table with admin's context credentials.\"\n\nThe retriever results support this decision, with CWE-862 being a top contender. While CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, a review of its children did not reveal a more specific fit. CWE-668 **Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere** was considered but is not as precise as CWE-862.
