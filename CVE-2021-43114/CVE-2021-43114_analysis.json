This is a base level CWE, providing a good balance between specificity and generality. CWE-295 is peer to CWE-322 (Key Exchange without Entity Authentication), and has parent-child relationships with other certificate related CWEs like CWE-297, but they are not as relevant. CWE-400 is a class level CWE, representing a broader category of resource consumption issues, and is considered because a crash occurs as a result of the **improper certificate validation** which relates to consuming resources.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe295[\"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe297[\"CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch\"]\n\n    cwe297 -->|CHILDOF| cwe295\n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe295 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the FORT Validator receiving an X.509 EE certificate. Due to **improper certificate validation** (CWE-295), the validator crashes, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The crash can be seen as **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting impact. The primary CWE, CWE-295, directly addresses the root cause: **improper certificate validation**. This is supported by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states, \"The vulnerability stems from **improper handling of certificate data** and **lack of proper validation** within the FORT RPKI validator, specifically related to the processing of certificates during RPKI validation.\" The secondary CWE, CWE-400, reflects the resulting denial-of-service condition caused by the crash. The choice of CWE-295 is based on the evidence that the vulnerability is directly related to certificate validation, which leads to a crash. The crash is a form of resource consumption.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports.
