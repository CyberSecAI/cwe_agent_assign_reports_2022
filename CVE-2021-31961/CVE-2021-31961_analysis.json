CWE-667, Improper Locking, is a related Class-level CWE that represents a potential cause for race conditions. Although CWE-667 is broader, it's considered as a contributing factor.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe667 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe367\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe367 primary\n    class cwe667 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper locking** (CWE-667), leading to a **TOCTOU race condition** (CWE-367), which results in an **elevation of privilege**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified a TOCTOU race condition due to improper locking. The evidence from \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"The vulnerability is due to a **lack of proper locking** when the Microsoft Store Install Service performs operations on a file,\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: **Time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition**.\" This directly supports the selection of CWE-367 as the primary weakness.\n\nCWE-667 was considered because the root cause description mentions \"lack of proper locking\". It is a potential contributing factor, but CWE-367 more accurately captures the specific vulnerability mechanism.\n\nThe final selection is based on the available evidence and the relationships between the identified CWEs. CWE-367 is the most specific base-level weakness that accurately represents the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
