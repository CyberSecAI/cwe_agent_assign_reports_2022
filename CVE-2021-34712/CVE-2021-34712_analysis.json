It is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) and CWE-943 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements that Modify SQL Query Logic). The secondary CWE, CWE-20, is a class-level CWE representing improper input validation, which is a broader category. While input validation is the root cause, the more specific CWE-89 is preferred.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements that Modify SQL Query Logic\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n    cwe89 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient input validation** (CWE-20), which leads to the possibility of **SQL injection** (CWE-89). The impact of successful exploitation is the ability to obtain sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards CWE-89 (SQL Injection) due to the presence of \"cypher query language injection attacks.\" The vulnerability description highlights the **insufficient input validation** as the root cause. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms these findings, emphasizing the **root cause** as **insufficient input validation** and the presence of a Cypher Query Language Injection **weakness**.\n\nCWE-20 was considered as a potential primary mapping due to the **insufficient input validation**. However, the presence of SQL injection makes CWE-89 a more specific and appropriate choice. CWE-20 is kept as a secondary mapping, acknowledging that the root cause is a lack of proper input validation.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is based on its direct relevance to SQL injection, as evidenced by the vulnerability description and confirmed by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\" While CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a relevant contributing factor, CWE-89 provides a more precise classification of the vulnerability. The evidence strongly supports the identification of an SQL injection vulnerability due to the **insufficient input validation**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\nThis CWE was not selected because it is not the primary issue.
