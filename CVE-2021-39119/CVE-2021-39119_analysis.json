CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is a high-level pillar, while CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is a Class that is a ChildOf CWE-284. CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) is a Base and a ChildOf CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and ChildOf CWE-284. The abstraction level of the CWEs was considered to select the most specific and appropriate representation of the vulnerability.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe284,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **broken access control** (**WEAKNESS**) that allows users who have watched an issue to continue receiving updates even after their Jira account is revoked. The chain progresses from the **improper authorization** (**ROOTCAUSE**) to the unauthorized receipt of issue updates.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is a **broken access control** in the issue notification feature. The evidence from the vulnerability description clearly points to an authorization issue, as users whose accounts have been revoked continue to receive notifications.\n\nThe final decision was to select CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) as the primary CWE, despite it being discouraged, because the vulnerability is at its core about improper authorization. The vulnerability description states that the root cause is \"**broken access control**\" and the impact is that users \"receive updates on issue after account revoked.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states \"Users who were watching an issue continued to receive updates even after their Jira account was revoked. This indicates a failure to properly check user permissions or status before sending notifications.\" This maps directly to the definition of Improper Authorization.\n\nCWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) was considered as a secondary CWE because the key value identifying the data is not properly checked. However, this CWE is more specific to scenarios where the user directly modifies the key, which is not explicitly stated in the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-284 (Improper Access Control) was also considered but deemed too high-level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
