The vulnerability description states that there is an **open redirect** vulnerability due to **improper path handling**. The secondary CWE, CWE-22, is also a Base level CWE. It is related because **improper path handling** can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe601[\"CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe610[\"CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe601 -->|CHILDOF| cwe610\n    cwe22 -->|PEEROF| cwe601\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe601 primary\n    class cwe22 secondary\n    class cwe610 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper path handling**, which leads to an **open redirect** vulnerability, allowing a malicious actor to redirect a victim to an attacker-controlled domain, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-601 as the primary weakness, given the explicit mention of an **open redirect** vulnerability. The retriever results also list CWE-601 with a score of 1.0, giving further weight to this classification. The description of CWE-601 closely aligns with the vulnerability description: \"The web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a redirect.\"\n\nThe evidence provided in the vulnerability description key phrases and CVE reference links content summary points directly to the root cause being **improper path handling**, leading to an **open redirect**. The relationship graph shows that CWE-601 is a child of CWE-610, indicating that the redirect is to a resource outside the intended sphere of control.\n\nCWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')) was also considered, given the **improper path handling** root cause. While not the primary manifestation of the vulnerability, **improper path handling** could also potentially lead to path traversal.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as CWE-601 directly addresses the **open redirect** vulnerability, and CWE-22 acknowledges the potential for path traversal resulting from the **improper path handling**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
