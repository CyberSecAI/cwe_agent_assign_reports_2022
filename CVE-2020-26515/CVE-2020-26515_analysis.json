While CWE-522 is a broader class, CWE-312 directly addresses the specific issue of storing credentials in cleartext due to the **NULL encryption key**. CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) is related, as the **NULL key** effectively acts as a hard-coded key, but CWE-312 more accurately describes the core problem. CWE-256 is also considered because the root cause leads to the password being stored in plaintext in the cookie.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe798 -->|PEEROF| cwe256\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe798,cwe256 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a coding error in the key generation logic, leading to a **NULL encryption key** and an empty salt. This results in credentials being stored in cleartext in the \"remember-me\" cookie. The attacker can then intercept the cookie, decrypt the credentials (trivially due to the **NULL key**), and gain unauthorized access to the user's account.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **insecure credentials storage**. The key piece of evidence is that the credentials are encrypted using a **NULL encryption key** due to a bug. This maps directly to CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) because the **NULL key** effectively means no encryption is taking place, and the credentials are being stored in cleartext.\n\nThe retriever results suggested other possible CWEs, like CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) and CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials). While the **NULL key** could be seen as a hard-coded key (CWE-798), the more direct issue is the cleartext storage itself (CWE-312). CWE-522 is too broad, as it encompasses various ways credentials can be insufficiently protected, but this vulnerability is specifically about cleartext storage.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-312 is based on its specificity and the direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which clearly states that the credentials are encrypted with a **NULL key**. This effectively results in cleartext storage. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-312 allows its usage at the Base level, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 6954.75\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.569\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nStoring a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
