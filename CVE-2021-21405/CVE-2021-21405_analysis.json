It is related to CWE-345 (**Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity**), a Class-level CWE, through a ChildOf relationship. CWE-1240 (**Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation**) is also a Base level CWE and is related to CWE-327 (**Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**), a Class-level CWE, through a ChildOf relationship.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n\n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe1240 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe345,cwe1240,cwe327 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **BLS signature validation** using the `blst` library, which accepts signatures in two forms. This leads to **two different valid block CIDs available for each block**. The impact of this weakness is that miners can be punished for valid blocks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links, points to **improper handling of BLS signatures** within the Lotus implementation of Filecoin. The `blst` library's `VerifyCompressed` method accepts both serialized and compressed signatures, resulting in multiple valid signature representations for the same block. This, coupled with the inclusion of the block signature in the CID calculation, allows for potentially malicious manipulation leading to the punishment of miners.\n\nThe retriever results and the complete CWE specifications strongly suggest CWE-347 (**Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature**) as the primary weakness. This is because the root cause lies in the fact that the system **does not properly verify the cryptographic signature**, which allows for signature malleability and leads to the acceptance of multiple valid signatures for the same data. The evidence supporting this is the fact that `VerifyCompressed` accepts two signature formats, and the system doesn't enforce a single format.\n\nCWE-1240 (**Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation**) is also considered as a secondary CWE because the `blst` library's method `VerifyCompressed` has a risky implementation.\n\nThe selection of CWE-347 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause, which is the lack of proper verification of the cryptographic signature. Choosing a higher-level CWE like CWE-345 (**Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity**) would be too general, while lower-level CWEs might not capture the specific cryptographic nature of the vulnerability. The MITRE mapping guidance supports the selection of Base-level CWEs when appropriate, and CWE-347 fits this criterion perfectly.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
