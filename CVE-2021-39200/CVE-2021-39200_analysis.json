The retriever also suggests CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)], which can occur due to the exposure of nonces. CWE-200 is a parent of CWE-201 [Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data]. While CWE-201 is more specific, CWE-200 is chosen because the vulnerability lies in the general exposure, not necessarily the specific act of inserting it into sent data. CWE-352 is related to the exposure of nonces because the nonces can be used to perform CSRF attacks.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    \n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe352 -- REALTED TO --> cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe352 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **output data of the function wp_die() can be leaked** (weakness) leading to the exposure of sensitive information such as nonces. This exposure can then be exploited to **perform actions on your behalf** (impact), which is a CSRF attack.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **exposure of sensitive information**.\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states \"**output data of the function wp_die() can be leaked** under certain conditions, which can include data like nonces.\"\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating: \"The primary weakness is the unintended disclosure of sensitive data when `wp_die()` is used with JSONP, such as nonces.\"\nGiven this evidence, CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] is the most appropriate primary CWE. While CWE-201 [Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data] is a child of CWE-200, the description does not indicate that the sensitive information was necessarily *inserted* into sent data, but simply exposed. CWE-352 is a potential secondary CWE because the exposed nonces can be used to perform CSRF attacks. However, the primary issue is the information exposure, so CWE-200 is the more appropriate primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
