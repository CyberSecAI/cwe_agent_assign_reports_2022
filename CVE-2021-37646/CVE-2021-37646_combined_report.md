## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) that occurs because a signed integer is converted to an unsigned integer. This conversion happens because the `reserve` method, which takes an unsigned long, is called with a potentially negative value derived from user-supplied input. This **improper validation** (CWE-1284) of the input quantity leads to an unexpected large memory allocation. The **incorrect conversion** (CWE-681) from a signed to unsigned integer is a contributing factor in triggering the overflow.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper validation** of the `ngram_widths` input (CWE-1284). This allows a negative value to be passed to the `reserve` method. Then, an **incorrect conversion** between numeric types (CWE-681) occurs when the signed integer is implicitly converted to an unsigned long. This results in a very large positive value which is then used to allocate memory, leading to an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) and potential denial of service.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-190, **Integer Overflow or Wraparound**. The description states that the vulnerability involves an **integer overflow** due to converting a signed integer value to an unsigned one, which directly matches the CWE's description. The `ngram_widths` parameter is converted from a signed integer to an unsigned long, which can cause the value to become a very large number if a negative value is provided as input. This large number is then used for memory allocation, leading to a potential denial of service. This is strongly supported by the vulnerability description: "the implicit conversion transforms the negative value to a large integer". Confidence is high as the description explicitly mentions the **integer overflow**.

CWE-1284, **Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input**, is a secondary weakness. The vulnerability description indicates that the `ngram_widths` parameter is not validated, allowing negative values. This lack of validation allows the **integer overflow** to occur. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section notes the "Unvalidated Input" as a weakness and states that "The code did not properly validate the input `ngram_widths` parameter, allowing negative values to be used." This supports the mapping of CWE-1284 with a high confidence.

CWE-681, **Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types**, is also a secondary weakness. The implicit conversion from a signed integer to an unsigned long contributes to the **integer overflow**. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section specifically states that "leading to an implicit conversion of the negative integer to a large positive value." This evidence supports the inclusion of CWE-681 as a secondary weakness.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately describe the root cause and contributing factors of the vulnerability. CWE-190 describes the **integer overflow**, while CWE-1284 and CWE-681 describe the reasons and mechanisms that led to the overflow.

## Vulnerability Description
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams` is vulnerable to an **integer overflow** issue caused by converting a signed integer value to an unsigned one and then allocating memory based on this value. The [implementation](https//github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/string_ngrams_op.cc#L184) calls `reserve` on a `tstring` with a value that sometimes can be negative if user supplies negative `ngram_widths`. The `reserve` method calls `TF_TString_Reserve` which has an `unsigned long` argument for the size of the buffer. Hence, the implicit conversion transforms the negative value to a large integer. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit c283e542a3f422420cfdb332414543b62fc4e4a5. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **integer overflow**
- **product:** TensorFlow
- **version:** versions prior to 2.6.0 and 2.5.1 and 2.4.3 and 2.3.4
- **component:** tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-37646:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams` operation within TensorFlow. Specifically, the issue stems from how the code handles the `ngram_widths` parameter. Negative values for `ngram_widths` are passed to `tstring`'s `reserve` method. This method then calls `TF_TString_Reserve` which takes an `unsigned long` for the buffer size, leading to an implicit conversion of the negative integer to a large positive value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is an integer overflow due to the conversion of a negative signed integer (`ngram_widths`) to an unsigned integer, causing the allocation of an extremely large memory chunk.
*   **Unvalidated Input:** The code did not properly validate the input `ngram_widths` parameter, allowing negative values to be used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** The oversized memory allocation resulting from the integer overflow can lead to a crash due to excessive memory usage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a call to `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams` with negative values for `ngram_widths`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to execute TensorFlow code and control the arguments passed to `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams`. This could be a user running malicious TensorFlow code or an attacker that can control parameters being passed to TensorFlow API.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves adding a check to ensure that all values in `ngram_widths` are positive before allocating any memory, as shown in the provided commit diff.
*   The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.6.0. Patches were also applied to versions 2.3.4, 2.4.3 and 2.5.1.
*   The vulnerability was reported by the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Overflow: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
Wraparound: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
wrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of "wraparound"

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with "overflow," "underflow," and "wraparound" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called "underflows").


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.

**[Terminology]** 

"Integer overflow" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.


A "wraparound" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.


"Overflow" is sometimes conflated with "wraparound" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.


The "overflow" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use "overflow" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using "underflow" for exceeding the minimum.


Some people use "overflow" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses "underflow" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.


See [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.


**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.




## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-2639:** Chain: integer coercion error (CWE-192) prevents a return value from indicating an error, leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)




## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

### Extended Description


If the pointer contains an uninitialized value, then the value might not point to a valid memory location. This could cause the product to read from or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial of service. If the uninitialized pointer is used as a function call, then arbitrary functions could be invoked. If an attacker can influence the portion of uninitialized memory that is contained in the pointer, this weakness could be leveraged to execute code or perform other attacks.


Depending on memory layout, associated memory management behaviors, and product operation, the attacker might be able to influence the contents of the uninitialized pointer, thus gaining more fine-grained control of the memory location to be accessed.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.

**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-32878:** LLM product has a free of an uninitialized pointer
- **CVE-2010-0211:** chain: unchecked return value (CWE-252) leads to free of invalid, uninitialized pointer (CWE-824).
- **CVE-2009-2768:** Pointer in structure is not initialized, leading to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) and system crash.




## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read




## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().

### Extended Description

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Heap-based buffer overflows are usually just as dangerous as stack-based buffer overflows.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).




## CWE-1287: Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to be of a certain type, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually of the expected type.

### Extended Description


When input does not comply with the expected type, attackers could trigger unexpected errors, cause incorrect actions to take place, or exploit latent vulnerabilities that would not be possible if the input conformed with the expected type.


This weakness can appear in type-unsafe programming languages, or in programming languages that support casting or conversion of an input to another type.
