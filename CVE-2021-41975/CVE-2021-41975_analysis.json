CWE-425 (Direct Request) is a related Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-862 which can occur when authorization checks are missing for certain URLs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    cwe425 -->|ChildOf| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check (CWE-862). Because of this, a remote attacker can use a specific parameter to send a **direct request** (CWE-425) and then delete arbitrary files in the system.\n  - Missing Authorization (CWE-862)\n  - Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') (CWE-425)\n  - Arbitrary File Deletion (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **authorization bypass** as the root cause, indicating a problem with access control. The provided information clearly states that remote attackers can delete arbitrary files without logging in, indicating a **missing authorization** check.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as the primary CWE is based on the vulnerability description and key phrases, specifically the term \"**authorization bypass**\". This bypass allows unauthorized actions, namely deleting arbitrary files. The retriever results also list CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as a candidate.\n\nCWE-425 (Direct Request) is included as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability description mentions that remote attackers can use a \"specific parameter\" to delete files. This suggests a direct request to a resource that should be protected by authorization.\n\nThese CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity. CWE-862 is a Class that could have more specific Base-level children, but the description doesn't give enough information to determine if a more specific CWE is warranted.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents.
