# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-26999

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that impacted the decision was the ChildOf relationship where CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) is a child of CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor). However, CWE-532 is a more specific Base level CWE and thus a better fit than the more general Class level CWE-200.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is as follows:
1.  An Active Directory connection fails.
2.  The system logs sensitive information related to the failed connection. (**CWE-532**)
3.  Authenticated users can access the logs, leading to potential exposure of sensitive information. (**CWE-200**)

The root cause is the **logging of sensitive information** (CWE-532), which then leads to the potential impact of information exposure (CWE-200).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description, points strongly towards CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description clearly states that "NetApp Cloud Manager versions prior to 3.9.9 **log sensitive information** when an Active Directory connection fails." This aligns directly with the description of CWE-532, which states, "The product writes sensitive information to a log file."

The retriever results also support this assessment, with CWE-532 being the top-ranked CWE with a similarity score of 0.466. The mapping guidance for CWE-532 indicates that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred, and that it is acceptable to use.

While CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is also a relevant consideration, it is a more general Class-level CWE. The vulnerability description provides specific details about the sensitive information being logged, making CWE-532 a more precise and appropriate mapping. The MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-200 when more specific options are available.

Therefore, the final decision is to classify the vulnerability as CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) as the primary weakness, with CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) as a secondary candidate. This decision is based on the specific evidence from the vulnerability description, the retriever results, and the MITRE mapping guidance. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-532 being a Base-level CWE that accurately represents the weakness.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected as it is not relevant to the vulnerability description.*

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected as it is not relevant to the vulnerability description.*

## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected as it is not relevant to the vulnerability description.*

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected as it is not relevant to the vulnerability description.*

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This CWE was not selected as it is not relevant to the vulnerability description.*

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

*This CWE was not selected as it is too high-level and other CWEs are more appropriate.*

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected as it is not relevant to the vulnerability description.*

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not selected as it is not relevant to the vulnerability description.*

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This
