However, CWE-532 is a more specific Base level CWE and thus a better fit than the more general Class level CWE-200.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  An Active Directory connection fails.\n2.  The system logs sensitive information related to the failed connection. (**CWE-532**)\n3.  Authenticated users can access the logs, leading to potential exposure of sensitive information. (**CWE-200**)\n\nThe root cause is the **logging of sensitive information** (CWE-532), which then leads to the potential impact of information exposure (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description, points strongly towards CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description clearly states that \"NetApp Cloud Manager versions prior to 3.9.9 **log sensitive information** when an Active Directory connection fails.\" This aligns directly with the description of CWE-532, which states, \"The product writes sensitive information to a log file.\"\n\nThe retriever results also support this assessment, with CWE-532 being the top-ranked CWE with a similarity score of 0.466. The mapping guidance for CWE-532 indicates that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred, and that it is acceptable to use.\n\nWhile CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is also a relevant consideration, it is a more general Class-level CWE. The vulnerability description provides specific details about the sensitive information being logged, making CWE-532 a more precise and appropriate mapping. The MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-200 when more specific options are available.\n\nTherefore, the final decision is to classify the vulnerability as CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) as the primary weakness, with CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) as a secondary candidate. This decision is based on the specific evidence from the vulnerability description, the retriever results, and the MITRE mapping guidance. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-532 being a Base-level CWE that accurately represents the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
