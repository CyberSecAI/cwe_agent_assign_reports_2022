It is a child of CWE-710 Weaknesses in Interpreted Languages. The secondary CWE, CWE-1281 **Sequence of Processor Instructions Leads to Unexpected Behavior**, is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-691 Missing Control of Interaction Completeness. These relationships show that the vulnerability stems from relying on unspecified behavior, possibly due to instruction sequence issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe758[\"CWE-758: Reliance on Undefined, Unspecified, or Implementation-Defined Behavior\"]\n    cwe710[\"CWE-710: Weaknesses in Interpreted Languages\"]\n    cwe1281[\"CWE-1281: Sequence of Processor Instructions Leads to Unexpected Behavior\"]\n    cwe691[\"CWE-691: Missing Control of Interaction Completeness\"]\n\n    cwe758 -->|CHILDOF| cwe710\n    cwe1281 -->|CHILDOF| cwe691\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe758 primary\n    class cwe1281 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with the **incorrect slice construction** using `std::slice::from_raw_parts()` and the **unsafe `__cpuid_count()` intrinsic exposed as a safe function** without proper CPU support checks. This leads to undefined behavior and potential crashes, culminating in a denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** and **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** revealed that the issue stems from undefined behavior and calling `cpuid_count()` on unsupported CPUs.\n\nCWE-758 **Reliance on Undefined, Unspecified, or Implementation-Defined Behavior** is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description details how the code relies on undefined behavior when constructing byte slices and when calling the `__cpuid_count()` intrinsic on unsupported CPUs. The CVE summary states, \"Undefined behavior due to constructing byte slices using `std::slice::from_raw_parts()` with data from `#[repr(Rust)]` structs in `VendorInfo::as_string()`, `SoCVendorBrand::as_string()`, and `ExtendedFunctionInfo::processor_brand_string()`\" and \"Exposing the unsafe `__cpuid_count()` intrinsic as a safe function in `native_cpuid::cpuid_count()` without checking if the CPU supports the function, violating safety requirements.\"\n\nCWE-1281 **Sequence of Processor Instructions Leads to Unexpected Behavior** is a secondary candidate because the crash is caused by a specific instruction (`CPUID`) being called on an unsupported CPU.\n\nCWE-758 is preferred over CWE-1281 as the primary because it covers both undefined behavior issues (slice construction and CPUID call).\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity. CWE-758 is a Class, but the evidence doesn't allow for a more specific Base or Variant level CWE selection.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-758: Reliance on Undefined, Unspecified, or Implementation-Defined Behavior\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an API function, data structure, or other entity in a way that relies on properties that are not always guaranteed to hold for that entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
