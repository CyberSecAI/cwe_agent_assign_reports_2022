Given that the vulnerability description explicitly states that the **authentication is not correctly enforced**, and login succeeds with arbitrary passwords, CWE-303, *Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm*, is a more precise, base-level classification than its parent, CWE-1390, *Weak Authentication*.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe303[\"CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe303 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe303 primary\n    class cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect enforcement of authentication** (CWE-303), leading to the impact where **login succeeds with arbitrary passwords**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-1390, *Weak Authentication*, as a potential candidate, which aligns with the general problem of insufficient authentication. However, after further review, the vulnerability description indicates the **root cause** is an **incorrect implementation** rather than a general weakness, which is the reason CWE-303 was chosen as the primary CWE.\n\nThe description states: \"After setting up SAML/OAuth, **authentication is not correctly enforced** on the native login page.
