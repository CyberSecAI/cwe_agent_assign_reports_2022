It is a child of CWE-285, Improper Authorization, and CWE-284, Improper Access Control. The vulnerability description explicitly states a **lack of ACL checks**, directly mapping to the absence of authorization. The secondary CWE is CWE-200, Exposure of Sensitive Information, also a Class-level CWE. It describes the **impact** of the vulnerability, where module names, normally inaccessible, are leaked.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe200 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of ACL checks** (CWE-862), leading to the exposure of names of unpublished and/or inaccessible modules (CWE-200). The root cause is the missing authorization check, and the impact is the information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary, which clearly state the **lack of ACL checks** as the root cause and the exposure of module names as the impact.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"The **lack of ACL checks** in the orderPosition endpoint of com_modules leak names of unpublished and/or inaccessible modules.\"\n\nThe CVE reference summary states: \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of Access Control List (ACL) checks in the `orderPosition` endpoint of the `com_modules` component.\"\n\nCWE-862 aligns perfectly with the root cause. The **impact** is the information disclosure, which aligns with CWE-200, Exposure of Sensitive Information.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): This was not selected because the issue is a **lack** of authorization, not an incorrect authorization implementation.\n*   CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): This is a high-level Pillar, and CWE-862 is a more specific child.\n*   CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)): This is not applicable as the vulnerability is not related to CSRF.\n*   CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor): While information is exposed, it's not explicitly \"private personal information\".\n*   CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key): This is not applicable because there is no user-controlled key involved in the authorization bypass.\n*   CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data): This is related to information exposure, but CWE-200 is more appropriate because it is about the **exposure** of information through data queries, not the **insertion** of the information into sent data.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-862 representing the root cause and CWE-200 representing the impact.",
