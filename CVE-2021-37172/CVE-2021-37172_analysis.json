CWE-287 is a child of CWE-284, Improper Access Control. CWE-798, Use of Hard-coded Credentials, is a Class and a possible cause of the authentication bypass, and is a child of CWE-259, Hardcoded Password. The abstraction levels were considered, favoring lower-level CWEs where possible, but CWE-287 is explicitly stated in the CVE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper provisioning** of the SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU using TIA Portal V13, which leads to **improper authentication** (CWE-287) and culminates in the ability to **bypass authentication and download arbitrary programs** to the PLC, leading to unauthorized control.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-287 as the primary weakness due to its direct mention in the CVE description: \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper Authentication (CWE-287).\" However, CWE-287 is a Class-level CWE, and the mapping guidance discourages its use when lower-level CWEs might be applicable.\n\nThe analysis considered alternative CWEs, particularly those related to the root cause of the authentication failure. The failure to authenticate against configured passwords when provisioned with TIA Portal V13 suggests a potential issue with how the passwords were handled during the provisioning process.\n\nUltimately, the decision to retain CWE-287 as the primary CWE is based on the explicit mention in the vulnerability description. However, CWE-798, Use of Hard-coded Credentials, is included as a secondary CWE because the provisioning process might have resulted in hard-coded credentials or a similar weakness that led to the authentication bypass.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
