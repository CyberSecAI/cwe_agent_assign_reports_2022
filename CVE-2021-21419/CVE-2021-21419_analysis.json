CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) is a child of CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling). Both CWE-409 and CWE-789 are related to resource consumption issues, but CWE-409 more accurately captures the root cause of improper handling of highly compressed data, while CWE-789 represents the outcome of excessive memory allocation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe409[\"CWE-409: Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification)\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe405[\"CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    \n    cwe409 -->|CHILDOF| cwe405\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe409 primary\n    class cwe789 secondary\n    class cwe405,cwe770 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the websocket peer sending highly compressed data, which leads to improper handling of compressed data (CWE-409), resulting in excessive memory allocation (CWE-789) and ultimately leading to memory exhaustion.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The evidence clearly indicates that the vulnerability is due to the **improper handling of highly compressed data**, which leads to memory exhaustion. The CVE reference links content summary explicitly mentions CWE-409 (Improper Handling of Compressed Data) and CWE-789 (Uncontrolled Memory Allocation) as relevant CWEs.\n\nThe primary CWE, CWE-409, is chosen because it accurately reflects the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the improper handling of highly compressed data. The vulnerability description key phrases highlight the **memory leak** and memory exhaustion caused by very large websocket frames. The retriever results also show that CWE-409 is a strong match for the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) is considered as a secondary CWE because it represents the outcome of the improper handling of compressed data, leading to excessive memory allocation.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately capture the root cause and the resulting impact of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
