The vulnerability description and CVE reference summary clearly point to this **weakness**, but lack specific details to choose a more specific CWE.\n\nThe primary CWE match is CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), a Pillar. While the MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-284 due to its high-level nature and potential for misuse, the provided vulnerability description lacks the specificity required to select a more detailed Base or Variant CWE. The description simply states \"**improper access control**\" without specifying the type of access control issue (e.g., authentication, authorization, privilege assignment).\n\nGiven the limited information, mapping to a more specific child of CWE-284 would be speculative. Therefore, despite the discouragement, CWE-284 remains the most accurate representation of the vulnerability based on the available evidence.\n\nOther CWEs Considered but Not Used:\n- CWE-285 (Improper Authorization): Considered but not used because the description doesn't specifically point to an authorization issue.\n- CWE-287 (Improper Authentication): Considered but not used because the description doesn't specifically point to an authentication issue.\n- CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): Considered but not used because the description doesn't specifically point to missing authentication.\n- CWE-862 (Missing Authorization): Considered but not used because the description doesn't specifically point to missing authorization.\n- CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): Considered but not used because the description doesn't specifically point to incorrect authorization.\n- CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource): Considered but not used because the description doesn't specifically point to incorrect permission assignment.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-284 is based on the explicit mention of \"**improper access control**\" in the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. While the MITRE mapping guidance advises against using such a high-level CWE, the lack of further details necessitates its selection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-284: Improper Access Control\n**Abstraction:** Pillar\n\n### Description\nThe product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.",
