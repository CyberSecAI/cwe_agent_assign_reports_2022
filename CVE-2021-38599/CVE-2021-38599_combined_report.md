## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** because the backups are stored in cleartext due to the failure to properly implement encryption. This relates to **CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions** because the application **fails** to check if libsodium support is available before attempting to use it, leading to the **impact** of storing sensitive data in cleartext. **CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information** is a potential issue as the backups are transmitted without encryption. There may be a relationship to **CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials** if the libsodium key was hardcoded.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is as follows:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper** implementation or check for libsodium support (potential **CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions**)
2.  **Weakness:** Application **fails** to encrypt backups when libsodium is not available, even when configured to do so.
3.  **Impact:** Sensitive backup data is stored in cleartext (**CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information**) and potentially transmitted in cleartext (**CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information**).

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, I considered **CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions** as the primary weakness since the root cause of the vulnerability is the **failure** to check for libsodium support. However, the primary impact is that the backups are stored in cleartext, so **CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** is a better primary mapping.

The CVE description explicitly states that the `wal-g` application, when built without libsodium support, silently ignored user-specified libsodium encryption keys and uploaded backups in plaintext. The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** also highlights that the **impact** is "uploads cleartext backups".

The relationship analysis confirms that **CWE-754** can lead to **CWE-312**. The retriever results also show **CWE-312** as a relevant CWE.

Therefore, the final decision is to map the vulnerability to **CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** as the primary weakness, with **CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions** as a secondary weakness to highlight the root cause. **CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information** may also be present if the backups are transmitted in cleartext.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-38599

## Vulnerability Description
WAL-G before 1.1, when a non-libsodium build (e.g., one of the official binary releases published as GitHub Releases) is used, silently ignores the libsodium encryption key and uploads cleartext backups. This is arguably a Principle of Least Surprise violation because the user likely wanted to encrypt all file activity.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** uploads cleartext backups
- **product:** WAL-G
- **version:** before 1.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-38599:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the fact that the `wal-g` application, when built without libsodium support, silently ignored user-specified libsodium encryption keys and uploaded backups in plaintext. This happened because the application did not check if it was compiled with libsodium support before attempting to use libsodium encryption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Silent Failure:** The application failed silently when it was requested to encrypt data with libsodium but was not compiled with the required support. Instead of throwing an error, it continued to operate, uploading data in plaintext.
- **Principle of Least Surprise violation:** The user expected the backup files to be encrypted due to setting encryption keys, but the application silently ignored them resulting in plaintext backups, violating the principle of least surprise.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application did not properly validate if it had the necessary libsodium support before attempting to use libsodium encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** The primary impact was the potential for a confidentiality breach. Backups that were intended to be encrypted were instead uploaded as plaintext, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access and exposure.
- **Data Exposure:**  Users who relied on the libsodium encryption were unknowingly exposing their backup data by storing them unencrypted in storage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Configuration Settings:**  An attacker with access to the backup storage could read the unencrypted backups.
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** If an attacker had a man-in-the-middle position to intercept the backup transfer, they would be able to read the content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have access to the storage location where the backups were stored, or the attacker needs to be in a man-in-the-middle position to intercept the backup transfer.
- No specific user interaction is required.
- No special privileges required

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in `wal-g` versions prior to 1.1.
- The fix was implemented in version 1.1. The fix includes a check to ensure that if a libsodium key is specified, and the application is not compiled with libsodium support, the application will exit with an error message.
- The fix also enables libsodium in the GitHub release builds.
- The fix was introduced with the merge of pull request #1062.
- This issue was assigned CVE-2021-38599 and GHSA-vrmr-f2qh-3hhf.
- The issue was classified as having a High severity with a CVSS score of 7.5.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

### Extended Description


The programmer may assume that certain events or conditions will never occur or do not need to be worried about, such as low memory conditions, lack of access to resources due to restrictive permissions, or misbehaving clients or components. However, attackers may intentionally trigger these unusual conditions, thus violating the programmer's assumptions, possibly introducing instability, incorrect behavior, or a vulnerability.


Note that this entry is not exclusively about the use of exceptions and exception handling, which are mechanisms for both checking and handling unusual or unexpected conditions.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-703
CanPrecede -> CWE-416

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Sometimes, when a return value can be used to indicate an error, an unchecked return value is a code-layer instance of a missing application-layer check for exceptional conditions. However, return values are not always needed to communicate exceptional conditions. For example, expiration of resources, values passed by reference, asynchronously modified data, sockets, etc. may indicate exceptional conditions without the use of a return value.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-49286:** Chain: function in web caching proxy does not correctly check a return value (CWE-253) leading to a reachable assertion (CWE-617)
- **CVE-2007-3798:** Unchecked return value leads to resultant integer overflow and code execution.
- **CVE-2006-4447:** Program does not check return value when invoking functions to drop privileges, which could leave users with higher privileges than expected by forcing those functions to fail.




## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key
**Abstraction:** Variant

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation
- **CVE-2022-30271:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used by default.
- **CVE-2020-10884:** WiFi router service has a hard-coded encryption key, allowing root access




## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials

- **CVE-2022-35411:** Python-based RPC framework enables pickle functionality by default, allowing clients to unpickle untrusted data.




## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

### Extended Description


Because the information is stored in cleartext (i.e., unencrypted), attackers could potentially read it. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.


When organizations adopt cloud services, it can be easier for attackers to access the data from anywhere on the Internet.


In some systems/environments such as cloud, the use of "double encryption" (at both the software and hardware layer) might be required, and the developer might be solely responsible for both layers, instead of shared responsibility with the administrator of the broader system/environment.

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Different people use "cleartext" and "plaintext" to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.
- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie
- **CVE-2009-1466:** password stored in cleartext in a file with insecure permissions




## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

- **CVE-2022-30312:** Building Controller uses a protocol that transmits authentication credentials in plaintext.
- **CVE-2022-31204:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends password in plaintext.




## CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a default cryptographic key for potentially critical functionality.

### Extended Description
It is common practice for products to be designed to use default keys. The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise. However, if admins do not change the defaults, it is easier for attackers to bypass authentication quickly across multiple organizations.

## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.

### Extended Description
When a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which "permissions" are not checked, which is an "authorization" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure "Everyone: Full Control" permissions for files under the "Program Files" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.
- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.




## CWE-214: Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
A process is invoked with sensitive command-line arguments, environment variables, or other elements that can be seen by other processes on the operating system.

### Extended Description
Many operating systems allow a user to list information about processes that are owned by other users. Other users could see information such as command line arguments or environment variable settings. When this data contains sensitive information such as credentials, it might allow other users to launch an attack against the product or related resources.

### Alternative Terms
