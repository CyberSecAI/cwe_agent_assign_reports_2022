# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-28129

## Vulnerability Description
While working on Apache OpenOffice 4.1.8 a developer discovered that the DEB package did not install using root, but instead used a userid and groupid of 500. This both caused issues with desktop integration and could allow a crafted attack on files owned by that user or group if they exist. Users who installed the Apache OpenOffice 4.1.8 DEB packaging should upgrade to the latest version of Apache OpenOffice.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **vector:** crafted attack
- **product:** Apache OpenOffice
- **version:** 4.1.8
- **component:** DEB package

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28129:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Apache OpenOffice 4.1.8 DEB package was incorrectly configured to install using a non-root user ID (500) and group ID (500) instead of root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Permissions:** The DEB package failed to install with root privileges, leading to files being owned by a non-root user and group (500). This creates a permission issue where files are not correctly owned by the system.
- **Potential for Local Privilege Escalation:** If a user or group with UID/GID 500 existed and had files within the installation path, it opens the door for crafted attacks that could leverage the incorrect ownership. This means if the files belonging to that user and group existed in the same location that AOO was attempting to write, the install process could overwrite their files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Desktop Integration Issues:**  The incorrect installation using a non-root user/group can cause issues with desktop integration of the application.
- **Local File Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially manipulate or overwrite files owned by the user/group with ID 500, if such a user/group happened to exist, leading to potential data corruption, modification or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Installation:** The vulnerability is triggered during the installation of the Apache OpenOffice 4.1.8 DEB package.
- **Crafted File Existence:** The attack scenario requires a user or group with ID 500 to exist on the system and have files in a directory where the package is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must be able to install the DEB package or have access to the local machine to exploit the vulnerability.
- **User/Group with ID 500:** The vulnerability relies on the existence of a user or group with user ID/group ID 500, and them having files that fall under ownership of the non-root user ID / group ID of 500.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Arrigo Marchiori.
- The recommended solution is to upgrade to the latest version of Apache OpenOffice.

This analysis provides more detail than the official CVE description, outlining the specific root cause, attack vector, and potential impact of the issue.

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** 

This overlaps verification errors, permissions, and privileges.


A closely related weakness is the incorrect assignment of groups to a resource. It is not clear whether it would fall under this entry or require a different entry.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-5101:** File system sets wrong ownership and group when creating a new file.
- **CVE-2007-4238:** OS installs program with bin owner/group, allowing modification.
- **CVE-2007-1716:** Manager does not properly restore ownership of a reusable resource when a user logs out, allowing privilege escalation.




## CWE-776: Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses XML documents and allows their structure to be defined with a Document Type Definition (DTD), but it does not properly control the number of recursive definitions of entities.

### Extended Description
If the DTD contains a large number of nested or recursive entities, this can lead to explosive growth of data when parsed, causing a denial of service.

### Alternative Terms
XEE: XEE is the acronym commonly used for XML Entity Expansion.
Billion Laughs Attack
XML Bomb: While the "XML Bomb" term was used in the early years of knowledge of this issue, the XEE term seems to be more commonly used.

## CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization
			Vector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are
			sufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected
			cryptographic requirements for that primitive.
			

### Extended Description
By design, some cryptographic primitives (such as block ciphers) require that IVs must have certain properties for the uniqueness and/or unpredictability of an IV. Primitives may vary in how important these properties are. If these properties are not maintained, e.g. by a bug in the code, then the cryptography may be weakened or broken by attacking the IVs themselves.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-330

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-1472:** ZeroLogon vulnerability - use of a static IV of all zeroes in AES-CFB8 mode
- **CVE-2011-3389:** BEAST attack in SSL 3.0 / TLS 1.0. In CBC mode, chained initialization vectors are non-random, allowing decryption of HTTPS traffic using a chosen plaintext attack.
- **CVE-2001-0161:** wireless router does not use 6 of the 24 bits for WEP encryption, making it easier for attackers to decrypt traffic




## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

### Extended Description


Attackers might be able to spoof the intended endpoint from a different system or process, thus gaining the same level of access as the intended endpoint.


While this issue frequently involves authentication between network-based clients and servers, other types of communication channels and endpoints can have this weakness.


### Alternative Terms

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30319:** S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which can be bypassed by a forged IP address.
- **CVE-2022-22547:** A troubleshooting tool exposes a web server on a random port between 9000-65535 that could be used for information gathering
- **CVE-2022-4390:** A WAN interface on a router has firewall restrictions enabled for IPv4, but it does not for IPv6, which is enabled by default




## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships

ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product creates a temporary file in a directory whose permissions allow unintended actors to determine the file's existence or otherwise access that file.

### Extended Description
On some operating systems, the fact that the temporary file exists may be apparent to any user with sufficient privileges to access that directory. Since the file is visible, the application that is using the temporary file could be known. If one has access to list the processes on the system, the attacker has gained information about what the user is doing at that time. By correlating this with the applications the user is running, an attacker could potentially discover what a user's actions are. From this, higher levels of security could be breached.

### Alternative Terms

**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-27818:** A hotkey daemon written in Rust creates a domain socket file underneath /tmp, which is accessible by any user.
- **CVE-2021-21290:** A Java-based application for a rapid-development framework uses File.createTempFile() to create a random temporary file with insecure default permissions.




## CWE-322: Key Exchange without Entity Authentication
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product performs a key exchange with an actor without verifying the identity of that actor.

### Extended Description
Performing a key exchange will preserve the integrity of the information sent between two entities, but this will not guarantee that the entities are who they claim they are. This may enable an attacker to impersonate an actor by modifying traffic between the two entities. Typically, this involves a victim client that contacts a malicious server that is impersonating a trusted server. If the client skips authentication or ignores an authentication failure, the malicious server may request authentication information from the user. The malicious server can then use this authentication information to log in to the trusted server using the victim's credentials, sniff traffic between the victim and trusted server, etc.

### Alternative Terms

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-0950:** Insufficiently random data used to generate session tokens using C rand(). Also, for certificate/key generation, uses a source that does not block when entropy is low.
- **CVE-2008-2108:** Chain: insufficient precision (CWE-1339) in random-number generator causes some zero bits to be reliably generated, reducing the amount of entropy (CWE-331)




## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.

### Extended Description


Although this weakness can occur with any type of resource, it is frequently introduced when a product uses a directory search path to find executables or code libraries, but the path contains a directory that can be modified by an attacker, such as "/tmp" or the current working directory.


In Windows-based systems, when the LoadLibrary or LoadLibraryEx function is called with a DLL name that does not contain a fully qualified path, the function follows a search order that includes two path elements that might be uncontrolled:


  - the directory from which the program has been loaded

  - the current working directory

In some cases, the attack can be conducted remotely, such as when SMB or WebDAV network shares are used.

One or more locations in that path could include the Windows drive root or its subdirectories. This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory. In Windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled.


In some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element.


In software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository. This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.


### Alternative Terms
DLL preloading: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.
Binary planting: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.
Insecure library loading: This term is one of several that are used to describe exploitation of untrusted search path elements in Windows systems, which received wide attention in August 2010. From a weakness perspective, the term is imprecise because it can apply to both CWE-426 and CWE-427.
Dependency confusion: As of February 2021, this term is used to describe CWE-427 in the context of managing installation of software package dependencies, in which attackers release packages on public sites where the names are the same as package names used by private repositories, and the search for the dependent package tries the public site first, downloading untrusted code. It may also be referred to as a "substitution attack."

ChildOf -> CWE-668
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Unlike untrusted search path (CWE-426), which inherently involves control over the definition of a control sphere (i.e., modification of a search path), this entry concerns a fixed control sphere in which some part of the sphere may be under attacker control (i.e., the search path cannot be modified by an attacker, but one element of the path can be under attacker control).

**[Theoretical]** This weakness is not a clean fit under CWE-668 or CWE-610, which suggests that the control sphere model might need enhancement or clarification.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-25815:** chain: a change in an underlying package causes the gettext function to use implicit initialization with a hard-coded path (CWE-1419) under the user-writable C:\ drive, introducing an untrusted search path element (CWE-427) that enables spoofing of messages.
- **CVE-2022-4826:** Go-based git extension on Windows can search for and execute a malicious "..exe" in a repository because Go searches the current working directory if git.exe is not found in the PATH
- **CVE-2020-26284:** A Static Site Generator built in Go, when running on Windows, searches the current working directory for a command, possibly allowing code execution using a malicious .exe or .bat file with the name being searched




## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.

### Extended Description
Some regular expression engines have a feature called "backtracking". If the token cannot match, the engine "backtracks" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.
 Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:


  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.

  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.

  - The input can be long enough.

 Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. 

### Alternative Terms
ReDoS: ReDoS is an abbreviation of "Regular expression Denial of Service".
Regular Expression Denial of Service: While this term is attack-focused, this is commonly used to describe the weakness.
Catastrophic backtracking: This term is used to describe the behavior of the regular expression as a negative technical impact.
