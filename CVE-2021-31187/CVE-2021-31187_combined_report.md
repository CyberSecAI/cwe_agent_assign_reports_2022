  - **Root Cause:** Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') (CWE-59) / Insecure Operation on Windows Junction / Mount Point (CWE-1386)
  - **Impact:** Elevation of Privilege

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis and resulting conclusion are heavily based on the provided evidence, specifically the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" which states: "The service can be abused to create a file in an arbitrary location by creating a directory junction." This directly points to a weakness related to link following or junction point handling.

CWE-59 is selected as the primary CWE due to its broad applicability to the **improper handling of links before file access**, and because CWE-1386 is a child of CWE-59, this makes CWE-59 the more appropriate primary root cause. However, the reference to directory junctions strongly suggests CWE-1386 as a relevant secondary CWE, as it is the Windows-specific implementation of link following.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-59 describes the general class of **link-following vulnerabilities**, while CWE-1386 describes the specific implementation related to Windows junctions and mount points.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
insecure temporary file: Some people use the phrase "insecure temporary file" when referring to a link following weakness, but other weaknesses can produce insecure temporary files without any symlink involvement at all.
Zip Slip: "Zip slip" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-706
ChildOf -> CWE-706

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** 

Link following vulnerabilities are Multi-factor Vulnerabilities (MFV). They are the combination of multiple elements: file or directory permissions, filename predictability, race conditions, and in some cases, a design limitation in which there is no mechanism for performing atomic file creation operations.


Some potential factors are race conditions, permissions, and predictability.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.
- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.
- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.




## CWE-1386: Insecure Operation on Windows Junction / Mount Point
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product opens a file or directory, but it does not properly prevent the name from being associated with a junction or mount point to a destination that is outside of the intended control sphere.

### Extended Description


Depending on the intended action being performed, this could allow an attacker to cause the product to read, write, delete, or otherwise operate on unauthorized files.


In Windows, NTFS5 allows for file system objects called reparse points. Applications can create a hard link from one directory to another directory, called a junction point. They can also create a mapping from a directory to a drive letter, called a mount point. If a file is used by a privileged program, but it can be replaced with a hard link to a sensitive file (e.g., AUTOEXEC.BAT), an attacker could excalate privileges. When the process opens the file, the attacker can assume the privileges of that process, tricking the privileged process to read, modify, or delete the sensitive file, preventing the program from accurately processing data. Note that one can also point to registries and semaphores.

## CWE-520: .NET Misconfiguration: Use of Impersonation
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Allowing a .NET application to run at potentially escalated levels of access to the underlying operating and file systems can be dangerous and result in various forms of attacks.

### Extended Description
.NET server applications can optionally execute using the identity of the user authenticated to the client. The intention of this functionality is to bypass authentication and access control checks within the .NET application code. Authentication is done by the underlying web server (Microsoft Internet Information Service IIS), which passes the authenticated token, or unauthenticated anonymous token, to the .NET application. Using the token to impersonate the client, the application then relies on the settings within the NTFS directories and files to control access. Impersonation enables the application, on the server running the .NET application, to both execute code and access resources in the context of the authenticated and authorized user.

### Alternative Terms

## CWE-416: Use After Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Dangling pointer: a pointer that no longer points to valid memory, often after it has been freed
UAF: commonly used acronym for Use After Free

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-20141:** Chain: an operating system kernel has insufficent resource locking (CWE-413) leading to a use after free (CWE-416).
- **CVE-2022-2621:** Chain: two threads in a web browser use the same resource (CWE-366), but one of those threads can destroy the resource before the other has completed (CWE-416).
- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-454: External Initialization of Trusted Variables or Data Stores
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product initializes critical internal variables or data stores using inputs that can be modified by untrusted actors.

### Extended Description
A product system should be reluctant to trust variables that have been initialized outside of its trust boundary, especially if they are initialized by users. The variables may have been initialized incorrectly. If an attacker can initialize the variable, then they can influence what the vulnerable system will do.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1419
CanAlsoBe -> CWE-456

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Overlaps Missing variable initialization, especially in PHP.

**[Applicable Platform]** 

This is often found in PHP due to register_globals and the common practice of storing library/include files under the web document root so that they are available using a direct request.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-43468:** WordPress module sets internal variables based on external inputs, allowing false reporting of the number of views
- **CVE-2000-0959:** Does not clear dangerous environment variables, enabling symlink attack.
- **CVE-2001-0033:** Specify alternate configuration directory in environment variable, enabling untrusted path.




## CWE-127: Buffer Under-read
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations prior to the targeted buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when the pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Additional Notes
**[Research Gap]** Under-studied.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-40985:** HTML conversion package has a buffer under-read, allowing a crash




## CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product dereferences a pointer that contains a location for memory that was previously valid, but is no longer valid.

### Extended Description
When a product releases memory, but it maintains a pointer to that memory, then the memory might be re-allocated at a later time. If the original pointer is accessed to read or write data, then this could cause the product to read or modify data that is in use by a different function or process. Depending on how the newly-allocated memory is used, this could lead to a denial of service, information exposure, or code execution.

### Alternative Terms
Dangling pointer

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships. Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being captured as chains.

**[Terminology]** Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the lower-level variants.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2008-5013:** access of expired memory address leads to arbitrary code execution
- **CVE-2010-3257:** stale pointer issue leads to denial of service and possibly other consequences
- **CVE-2008-0062:** Chain: a message having an unknown message type may cause a reference to uninitialized memory resulting in a null pointer dereference (CWE-476) or dangling pointer (CWE-825), possibly crashing the system or causing heap corruption.
