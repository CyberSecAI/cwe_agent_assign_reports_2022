The secondary weakness is CWE-79, Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'), which is a Base CWE. CWE-352 requires other CWEs to be present such as CWE-346, CWE-441, CWE-642, and CWE-613. CWE-79 is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). CWE-79 can precede CWE-494 (Download of Code Without Integrity Check) and is a peer of CWE-352.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Use of Multiple Unrelated Vulnerabilities\"]\n    cwe346[\"CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\"]\n    cwe441[\"CWE-441: Unintended Proxy or Intermediary\"]\n    cwe642[\"CWE-642: External Control of Critical State Data\"]\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n    cwe494[\"CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check\"]\n\n    cwe352 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe346\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe441\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe642\n    cwe352 -->|REQUIRES| cwe613\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe79 -->|PEEROF| cwe352\n    cwe79 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe494\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n    class cwe74,cwe345,cwe346,cwe441,cwe642,cwe613,cwe494 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing CSRF check** (CWE-352). This allows an attacker to trick an authenticated admin into creating a new button. Then one of the Button field is not escaped before being output in an attribute when editing a Button, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue (CWE-79) as well.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis identified two CWEs relevant to the vulnerability: CWE-352 and CWE-79.\n\nThe \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section identifies the **missing CSRF check** and **cross-site scripting** as a **rootcause** and **weakness**, which aligns with the description.\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section provides supporting information about the **CSRF vulnerability** and **Stored XSS vulnerability**.\nThe retriever results also list CWE-352 and CWE-79.\n\nCWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)) is selected because the function to create a new button is **lacking a CSRF check**. An attacker could use this to make an authenticated admin create a new button.\nCWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) is selected because one of the Button field is not escaped before being output in an attribute when editing a Button, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue as well.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-352 being a Compound type and CWE-79 being a Base type.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n*   CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output - While related to XSS, CWE-79 is a more direct match for the stored XSS vulnerability described.\n*   CWE-862: Missing Authorization - While CSRF can be seen as a form of missing authorization, CWE-352 is a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type - Not applicable as the vulnerability doesn't involve file uploads.\n*   CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter - Not applicable because the vulnerability doesn't involve assumed-immutable parameters.\n*   CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path - Not applicable because the vulnerability doesn't involve external control of filenames or paths.\n*   CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization - While CSRF can be seen as a form of incorrect authorization, CWE-352 is a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements - While related to XSS, CWE-79 is a more direct match for the stored XSS vulnerability described.\n*   CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information - Not applicable as the vulnerability doesn't involve cleartext transmission of sensitive information.",
