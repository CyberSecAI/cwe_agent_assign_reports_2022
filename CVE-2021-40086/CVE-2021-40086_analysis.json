While CWE-538 could be considered, the vulnerability specifically mentions the enrollment secret being revealed by checking the page source, making CWE-540 a more direct and appropriate match.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe540[\"CWE-540: Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n    \n    cwe540 -->|CHILDOF| cwe538\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe540 primary\n    class cwe538 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses in this vulnerability is relatively straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** The **inclusion of the sensitive enrollment secret in the page source** (CWE-540).\n2.  **Impact:** Revealing the enrollment secret to an administrator who views the page source, potentially leading to unauthorized access or compromise of the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nMy analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly states that the enrollment secret was reflected on a page and could be revealed by checking the page source. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-540, \"Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code.\"\n\nThe vulnerability description key phrases also support this assessment:\n\n*   **impact:** reveal enrollment secret\n*   **vector:** checking page source\n\nThe relationship graph also supports this assessment.\n\nBased on the evidence, CWE-540 is the most appropriate and specific CWE for this vulnerability. It accurately captures the root cause of the weakness, which is the **inclusion of sensitive information in the source code** accessible to administrators.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced
