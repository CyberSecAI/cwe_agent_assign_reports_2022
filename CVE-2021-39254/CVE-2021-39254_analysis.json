This can lead to **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)**, a Variant-level CWE, where the overflow occurs in memory allocated on the heap. CWE-190 is a child of CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe682[\"CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation\"]\n\n    cwe190 -->|CHILDOF| cwe682\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe788\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n    class cwe682 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow (CWE-190)**, which leads to a smaller than expected buffer being allocated, and then a **heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)** when data is written into the undersized buffer.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The **root cause** is clearly identified as an **integer overflow**, and the resulting impact is a **heap-based buffer overflow**.\n\nEvidence:\n*   \"A crafted NTFS image can cause an **integer overflow** in memmove, leading to a **heap-based buffer overflow** in the function ntfs_attr_record_resize, in NTFS-3G < 2021.8.22.\"\n*   \"**root_cause**: Integer overflow in memmove() within the `ntfs_attr_record_resize` function.\"\n*   \"**weaknesses**: [ \"CWE-190\" ]\"\n*   \"**impact**: Heap-based buffer overflow leading to potential arbitrary code execution.\"\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-190 as the top candidate. The relationship analysis confirms that integer overflows can lead to buffer overflows. The selection of CWE-190 and CWE-122 is at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately represent the **root cause** and impact of the vulnerability, respectively.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
