CWE-14 is a variant of CWE-733, which focuses on the specific issue of compiler optimizations removing code intended to clear sensitive data from memory. This variant is more specific and accurately describes the vulnerability. CWE-1240 is related to CWE-327 as a child, further clarifying the cryptographic aspect.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe14[\"CWE-14: Compiler Removal of Code to Clear Buffers\"]\n    cwe733[\"CWE-733: Weaknesses in Software Product that is not Hardware\"]\n    cwe1240[\"CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n\n    cwe14 -->|CHILDOF| cwe733\n    cwe1240 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe14 primary\n    class cwe1240,cwe327 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **cipher leak** due to the potential removal of memory clearing code by the compiler. This leads to the exposure of sensitive information and compromises data confidentiality.\n\n*   Root Cause: **Compiler Removal of Code to Clear Buffers (CWE-14)**\n*   Weakness: **Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation (CWE-1240)**\n*   Impact: Data Confidentiality breach\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the potential **cipher leak**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary highlights that the code uses `memset` to clear the `W` array, but this can be optimized away by the compiler. This led to considering **CWE-14: Compiler Removal of Code to Clear Buffers** as the primary weakness.\n\nThe analysis also considered **CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation** and **CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm** due to the cryptographic nature of the vulnerability.\n\nUltimately, **CWE-14** was selected as the primary CWE because the fix involved preventing compiler optimizations from removing the buffer clearing, which directly addresses the **root cause**. The other CWEs, **CWE-1240** and **CWE-327**, are related to the cryptographic context but are not the direct cause of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-14** is based on the evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states that \"The code uses memset to clear the W array but this can be optimized away by the compiler\" and \"The fix prevents compiler optimizations from removing the buffer clearing\".\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by emphasizing the importance of identifying the most specific CWE that accurately represents the vulnerability. **CWE-14** is a variant that specifically addresses the compiler optimization issue, making it the optimal choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-14: Compiler Removal of Code to Clear Buffers\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nSensitive memory is cleared according to the source code, but compiler optimizations leave the memory untouched when it is not read from again, aka \"dead store removal.\"\n\n### Extended Description\nThis compiler optimization error occurs when:\n1. Secret data are stored in memory.\n2. The secret data are scrubbed from memory by overwriting its contents.\n3. The source code is compiled using an optimizing compiler, which identifies and removes the function that overwrites the contents as a dead store because the memory is not used subsequently.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-733\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate",
