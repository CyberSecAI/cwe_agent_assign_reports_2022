CWE-317 is a variant of CWE-312, providing a more specific classification that aligns well with the vulnerability description. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a class-level CWE that is too general.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe317[\"CWE-317: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in GUI\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe317 -->|CHILDOF| cwe312\n    cwe312 -->|PARENT OF| cwe317\n    cwe200 -->|PARENT OF| cwe317\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe317 primary\n    class cwe312 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** Sensitive data (user password equivalent) is stored in **cleartext** within the SAP GUI for Windows, specifically within the GUI (**CWE-317**).\n2.  **Impact:** An attacker with local access to the client-side PC can obtain this sensitive data, leading to **information disclosure**.\n3.  **Exploitation:** The attacker can then use the disclosed credentials to log on to the backend system and launch further attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates that the **root cause** is the storage of a user's password equivalent in **cleartext** within the SAP GUI for Windows application. The key phrase \"obtain an equivalent of the users password\" and the context of local client-side access strongly suggest that the sensitive information is accessible via the GUI.\n\nThe retriever results highlight several potential CWEs, including CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data), CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere), and CWE-317 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in GUI).\n\nCWE-317 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in GUI) is the most appropriate choice because it accurately reflects the specific vulnerability detailed in the description. The vulnerability involves sensitive information (passwords) stored in **cleartext** and accessible through the GUI, which aligns perfectly with the CWE-317 description.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a more general CWE and is discouraged by MITRE for being too broad. While the vulnerability does result in information exposure, the **root cause** is the **insecure storage** of the password, not merely the exposure itself. Therefore, CWE-200 is not the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-317 is a Variant-level CWE, providing a more specific and accurate representation of the weakness than the Class-level CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information). The vulnerability involves storing sensitive data in **cleartext** within the GUI, which aligns precisely with the CWE-317 description.\nTherefore, I am confident in selecting CWE-317 as the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information without properly limiting read or write access by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.

In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders. If a system administrator can recover a password directly, or use a brute force search on the available information, the administrator can use the password on other accounts.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers,",
