CWE-256 is a more specific case of storing credentials insecurely, thus providing a more accurate classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe260[\"CWE-260: Password in Configuration File\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe260 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe260,cwe312 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **access token unencrypted storage** in the global configuration file, leading to potential unauthorized access and usage by attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference. The key piece of evidence is that \"Jenkins SMS Notification Plugin 1.2 and earlier stores an **access token unencrypted** in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller where it can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-256 is based on the fact that the **access token**, which functions as a password, is stored in plaintext. This is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. The retriever results also listed CWE-256 as the top candidate.\n\nOther CWEs, such as CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), CWE-260 (Password in Configuration File) and CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) were considered but deemed less specific. While CWE-522 is related, CWE-256 directly addresses the plaintext storage of a password. Similarly, while CWE-260 acknowledges that the password is in a configuration file, CWE-256 focuses on the core issue of plaintext storage. CWE-312 is more generic and doesn't explicitly mention passwords.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.84\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nStoring a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.

In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders.
