This is a common cause of out-of-bounds writes. CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**. CWE-125 **Out-of-bounds Read** is related as a peer, since a missing bounds check could also lead to reading out of bounds. CWE-129 **Improper Validation of Array Index** can precede CWE-787, if an invalid index is not checked, it can result in out of bounds write.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe129[\"CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe129 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe787 -- PEER OF --> cwe125\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe125,cwe129 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing bounds check** in the memory management driver, leading to a potential out-of-bounds write and a system crash.\n\nMissing Bounds Check -> Out-of-Bounds Write -> System Crash (Denial of Service)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is due to a **missing bounds check** in the memory management driver, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write.
