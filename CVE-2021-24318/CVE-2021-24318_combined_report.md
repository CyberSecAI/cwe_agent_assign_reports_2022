## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-639, which falls under the broader categories of CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). CWE-425 (Direct Request) is related as it describes a scenario where authorization checks are bypassed by directly accessing resources. CWE-862 is a class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-425. The selection of CWE-639 is due to the user-controlled key aspect, making it a more specific fit than its parents.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to ensure that the Post/Page and Booking to delete belong to the user making the request**. This leads to an IDOR vulnerability, allowing any authenticated user to delete arbitrary content. The chain can be represented as:
Missing Authorization -> User-Controlled Key -> Arbitrary Delete

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **lack of proper authorization checks**. The evidence from the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" section states, "**did not ensure that the Post/Page and Booking to delete belong to the user making the request**," highlighting the absence of validation. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms this, stating, "The Listeo theme failed to verify if the user making the request owned the Post/Page or Booking they were trying to delete."

CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) was selected as the primary CWE due to its specific focus on authorization bypass via user-controlled keys, which aligns directly with the IDOR aspect of the vulnerability. The vulnerability involves authenticated users manipulating IDs to access and delete resources they should not have access to. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" describes how `listing_id` and `booking_id` parameters can be manipulated.

CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) was considered because the vulnerability involves directly accessing resources without proper authorization. However, CWE-639 is more specific because it highlights the manipulation of the key, while CWE-425 is the consequence of that manipulation.

CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) was also considered as a more general description of the problem, but CWE-639 provides a more precise explanation of how the authorization bypass occurs.

The selection of CWE-639 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability (authorization bypass through user-controlled key) while also being a base-level CWE. The evidence clearly supports this classification, and the relationship analysis further validates this decision.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

### Extended Description


Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.


For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.


One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.


### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-36539:** An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.




## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction:** Compound
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

### Extended Description
When a web server is designed to receive a request from a client without any mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it might be possible for an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.

### Alternative Terms

Requires -> CWE-613

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.
**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine if other weaknesses allow CSRF attacks to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable CSRF tokens might allow bypass of CSRF protection mechanisms; if this occurs, they might be better characterized as randomness/predictability weaknesses.
**Reasons:**
- Other


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.


**[Theoretical]** 

The CSRF topology is multi-channel:


  - Attacker (as outsider) to intermediary (as user). The interaction point is either an external or internal channel.

  - Intermediary (as user) to server (as victim). The activation point is an internal channel.





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2004-1703:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag
- **CVE-2004-1995:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag
- **CVE-2004-1967:** Arbitrary code execution by specifying the code in a crafted img tag or URL




## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

### Extended Description
Web applications susceptible to direct request attacks often make the false assumption that such resources can only be reached through a given navigation path and so only apply authorization at certain points in the path.

### Alternative Terms
forced browsing: The "forced browsing" term could be misinterpreted to include weaknesses such as CSRF or XSS, so its use is discouraged.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Overlaps Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID), authorization errors, container errors; often primary to other weaknesses such as XSS and SQL injection.

**[Theoretical]** "Forced browsing" is a step-based manipulation involving the omission of one or more steps, whose order is assumed to be immutable. The application does not verify that the first step was performed successfully before the second step. The consequence is typically "authentication bypass" or "path disclosure," although it can be primary to all kinds of weaknesses, especially in languages such as PHP, which allow external modification of assumed-immutable variables.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29238:** Access-control setting in web-based document collaboration tool is not properly implemented by the code, which prevents listing hidden directories but does not prevent direct requests to files in those directories.
- **CVE-2022-23607:** Python-based HTTP library did not scope cookies to a particular domain such that "supercookies" could be sent to any domain on redirect.
- **CVE-2004-2144:** Bypass authentication via direct request.




## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-3597:** Web application stores database file under the web root with insufficient access control (CWE-219), allowing direct request.




## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-94

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** "HTML injection" (see CWE-79: XSS) could be thought of as an example of this, but the code is injected and executed on the client side, not the server side. Server-Side Includes (SSI) are an example of direct static code injection.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-0495:** Perl code directly injected into CGI library file from parameters to another CGI program.
- **CVE-2005-1876:** Direct PHP code injection into supporting template file.
- **CVE-2005-1894:** Direct code injection into PHP script that can be accessed by attacker.




## CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly protect an assumed-immutable element from being modified by an attacker.

### Extended Description
This occurs when a particular input is critical enough to the functioning of the application that it should not be modifiable at all, but it is. Certain resources are often assumed to be immutable when they are not, such as hidden form fields in web applications, cookies, and reverse DNS lookups.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** MAID issues can be primary to many other weaknesses, and they are a major factor in languages that provide easy access to internal program constructs, such as PHP's register_globals and similar features. However, MAID issues can also be resultant from weaknesses that modify internal state; for example, a program might validate some data and store it in memory, but a buffer overflow could overwrite that validated data, leading to a change in program logic.

**[Theoretical]** There are many examples where the MUTABILITY property is a major factor in a vulnerability.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-1757:** Relies on $PHP_SELF variable for authentication.
- **CVE-2005-1905:** Gain privileges by modifying assumed-immutable code addresses that are accessed by a driver.




## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
SQL injection: a common attack-oriented phrase
SQLi: a common abbreviation for "SQL injection"

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-943
ChildOf -> CWE-74

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** SQL injection can be resultant from special character mismanagement, MAID, or denylist/allowlist problems. It can be primary to authentication errors.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2023-32530:** SQL injection in security product dashboard using crafted certificate fields
- **CVE-2021-42258:** SQL injection in time and billing software, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-27101:** SQL injection in file-transfer system via a crafted Host header, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-620: Unverified Password Change
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
When setting a new password for a user, the product does not require knowledge of the original password, or using another form of authentication.

### Extended Description
This could be used by an attacker to change passwords for another user, thus gaining the privileges associated with that user.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-1390
