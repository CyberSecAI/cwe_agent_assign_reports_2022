# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-30155

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.31.12 and 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.2. **ContentModelChange does not check if a user has correct permissions to create and set the content model of a nonexistent page**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **ContentModelChange does not check if a user has correct permissions to create and set the content model of a nonexistent page**
- **product:** MediaWiki
- **version:** before 1.31.12 and 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.2
- **component:** ContentModelChange

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-30155:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a missing permission check in the `ContentModelChange` functionality of MediaWiki. Specifically, when a user attempts to create a new page and simultaneously set its content model using `Special:ChangeContentModel`, the system doesn't properly verify if the user has the necessary permissions to create the page in the first place, particularly in relation to the configured `TitleBlacklist`. This happens because `ContentModelChange` doesn't initially go through the normal edit page checks but instead relies on `WikiPage::doEditContent` after some checks and does not include the TitleBlacklist check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inadequate Permission Checks:** The `ContentModelChange` functionality lacks a check to determine if a user is authorized to create the page they are trying to create with a new content model.
- **Bypass of Title Blacklist:**  Because of the missing permission checks, the Title Blacklist restrictions, meant to prevent certain page titles from being created, can be bypassed when creating new pages using `Special:ChangeContentModel`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Page Creation:** Users who would otherwise be prevented from creating pages due to `TitleBlacklist` rules can successfully create such pages by using `Special:ChangeContentModel` to create the page and simultaneously set its content model.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **`Special:ChangeContentModel`:**  The attack vector involves using the `Special:ChangeContentModel` page in MediaWiki to create a non-existent page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **MediaWiki User:**  The attacker needs to be a registered user with the ability to access and use the `Special:ChangeContentModel` page.
- **Bypass Creation Restrictions:** The user must have the ability to use `Special:ChangeContentModel` and  be trying to create a page which they are otherwise not permitted to create due to TitleBlacklist rules.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `includes/content/ContentModelChange.php` file (or `includes/specials/SpecialChangeContentModel.php` for older versions).
- The fix involves adding a check within the `ContentModelChange` process to verify that the user has the "create" permission before creating the page (as opposed to only checking "editcontentmodel" and "edit" permissions). This check is performed by using `PermissionManager`'s `getPermissionErrors` or `getUserPermissionsErrors`.
- The patch addresses the issue by adding permission checks specifically for the "createpage" or "createtalk" action or just the create action, when the page does not yet exist.

**Additional Information:**

- This vulnerability was fixed in MediaWiki versions 1.35.2, 1.31.14, and later.
- The vulnerability was also present in the REL1_31 branch, and a specific patch was created for that version.
- The fix was deployed during a security window and tested by DannyS712.
- The fix also addresses extensions that use the "create" action, not just "createpage" or "createtalk".

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** 

This overlaps verification errors, permissions, and privileges.


A closely related weakness is the incorrect assignment of groups to a resource. It is not clear whether it would fall under this entry or require a different entry.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-5101:** File system sets wrong ownership and group when creating a new file.
- **CVE-2007-4238:** OS installs program with bin owner/group, allowing modification.
- **CVE-2007-1716:** Manager does not properly restore ownership of a reusable resource when a user logs out, allowing privilege escalation.




## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

### Extended Description


When resources are released, they can be made available for reuse. For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.


Even when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.


This weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-459
ChildOf -> CWE-212
CanPrecede -> CWE-201

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).

**[Maintenance]** This entry needs modification to clarify the differences with CWE-212. The description also combines two problems that are distinct from the CWE research perspective: the inadvertent transfer of information to another sphere, and improper initialization/shutdown. Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.

**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release
- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.
- **CVE-2003-0291:** router does not clear information from DHCP packets that have been previously used




## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read




## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
