It is a child of CWE-285 **Improper Authorization**. CWE-862 is more specific than CWE-285 because it explicitly states that there is no authorization check, while CWE-285 is more general, indicating that the authorization check is either missing or incorrect.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is as follows:\n1.  The `ContentModelChange` functionality **does not check if a user has correct permissions to create and set the content model of a nonexistent page**.\n2.  This leads to a **missing authorization** check.\n3.  Users can bypass the `TitleBlacklist` and create unauthorized pages.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is caused by a **missing authorization** check in the `ContentModelChange` functionality of MediaWiki. The system **does not check if a user has the correct permissions** to create and set the content model of a nonexistent page. This allows users to bypass the `TitleBlacklist` and create unauthorized pages.\n\nThe vulnerability description key phrases explicitly state the root cause is that `ContentModelChange does not check if a user has correct permissions to create and set the content model of a nonexistent page`. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, stating \"The root cause is a missing permission check in the `ContentModelChange` functionality of MediaWiki.\"\n\nCWE-862 **Missing Authorization** directly matches this root cause. The CWE description states: \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\"\n\nCWE-285 **Improper Authorization** was also considered, but it is a more general class of weakness. While technically applicable, CWE-862 is a more precise description of the vulnerability, making it the preferred choice.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately reflects the root cause of the vulnerability (missing authorization check). The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links strongly supports this classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
