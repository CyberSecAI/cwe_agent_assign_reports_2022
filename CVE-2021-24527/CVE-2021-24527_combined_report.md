## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-620 (Unverified Password Change), is a base-level CWE that directly addresses the core weakness: the ability to change a user's password without proper verification. This is related to CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication), of which it is a child. CWE-472 (External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter) is also relevant, as the vulnerability relies on the external control of the reset key. CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision) captures the general problem of making security decisions based on untrusted inputs.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient input sanitization** of the reset key, which leads to a bypassed check and finally results in an **unverified password change**, granting unauthorized access to the administrator account.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified several potential CWEs. The root cause is the **improper sanitization** of the reset key, specifically, the use of `sanitize_text_field` which leads to a bypass of the intended security checks. This directly enables the unverified password change. The key evidence supporting this analysis is the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section, which states: "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Profile Builder plugin handles password reset keys. Specifically, the password reset key is checked against the password recovery key, but it's processed using `sanitize_text_field`. This function strips HTML tags." Also "The fact that `sanitize_text_field` strips the HTML, and the application then checks if the key is empty is the root cause."

CWE-620 is the most specific and appropriate choice because it directly addresses the core weakness: the ability to change a user's password without proper verification, which is the ultimate impact of the vulnerability.
CWE-472 is also relevant, because the reset key, which should be immutable from the perspective of the application after it's been issued, is actually controllable by the user. This allows the user to manipulate it to bypass the security checks.
CWE-807 is relevant as well, as the application relies on the reset key to make security decisions, but this key is ultimately untrusted and can be modified by an attacker.

I am overriding the retriever results in the selection of CWE-620 because the other highly ranked CWEs are too general. CWE-472 and CWE-807 capture relevant aspects of the vulnerability but do not fully explain the root cause.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-24527

## Vulnerability Description
The User Registration & User Profile Profile Builder WordPress plugin before 3.4.9 has a bug allowing any user to reset the password of the admin of the blog, and gain unauthorised access, due to a bypass in the way the reset key is checked. Furthermore, the admin will not be notified of such change by email for example.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** reset password of admin, unauthorized access
- **vector:** bypass in reset key check
- **attacker:** any user
- **product:** User Registration & User Profile Profile Builder WordPress plugin
- **version:** before 3.4.9

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-24527:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Profile Builder plugin handles password reset keys. Specifically, the password reset key is checked against the password recovery key, but it's processed using `sanitize_text_field`. This function strips HTML tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:**  The core weakness is an authentication bypass that allows an attacker to reset the administrator's password without proper authorization.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The use of `sanitize_text_field` and its stripping of HTML tags is a weakness because the logic after this sanitization uses an `empty()` check. The fact that `sanitize_text_field` strips the HTML, and the application then checks if the key is empty is the root cause.
- **Lack of Email Notification:** The admin user does not receive a notification when their password is changed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain full administrative access to the WordPress site by resetting the admin password.
- **Complete Control:** With admin access, attackers can modify content, install malicious plugins, and perform any other administrative task, leading to complete compromise of the site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attack:** The attack is network based and involves sending a specially crafted request to the WordPress site's password reset page.
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the URL by adding a `?key=<a>` parameter to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Password Reset Page Abuse:** The vulnerability is exploited through the password reset functionality of the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not need to have any existing credentials or access to the site.
- **Access to Password Reset Page:** The attacker must be able to access the password reset page of the Profile Builder plugin.
- **Basic HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate a URL.

**Summary**
The vulnerability in Profile Builder allows an unauthenticated attacker to reset the administrator's password by exploiting a flaw in the password reset process. The sanitization function strips HTML which passes an empty check and allows a reset. This grants the attacker complete control over the WordPress site.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

### Extended Description


If a web product does not properly protect assumed-immutable values from modification in hidden form fields, parameters, cookies, or URLs, this can lead to modification of critical data. Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.


For example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is a primary weakness for many other weaknesses and functional consequences, including XSS, SQL injection, path disclosure, and file inclusion.

**[Theoretical]** This is a technology-specific MAID problem.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2002-0108:** Forum product allows spoofed messages of other users via hidden form fields for name and e-mail address.
- **CVE-2000-0253:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.
- **CVE-2000-0254:** Shopping cart allows price modification via hidden form field.




## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction:** Compound
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

### Extended Description
When a web server is designed to receive a request from a client without any mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it might be possible for an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.

Requires -> CWE-642
Requires -> CWE-613

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.
**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine if other weaknesses allow CSRF attacks to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable CSRF tokens might allow bypass of CSRF protection mechanisms; if this occurs, they might be better characterized as randomness/predictability weaknesses.
**Reasons:**
- Other


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.


**[Theoretical]** 

The CSRF topology is multi-channel:


  - Attacker (as outsider) to intermediary (as user). The interaction point is either an external or internal channel.

  - Intermediary (as user) to server (as victim). The activation point is an internal channel.





### Observed Examples

- **CVE-2004-1995:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag
- **CVE-2004-1967:** Arbitrary code execution by specifying the code in a crafted img tag or URL




## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships

### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.
- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).




## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

### Extended Description


Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.


For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.


One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.


### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.
