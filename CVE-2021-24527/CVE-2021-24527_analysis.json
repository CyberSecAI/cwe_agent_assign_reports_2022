This is related to CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication), of which it is a child. CWE-472 (External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter) is also relevant, as the vulnerability relies on the external control of the reset key. CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision) captures the general problem of making security decisions based on untrusted inputs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe620[\"CWE-620: Unverified Password Change\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe472[\"CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\"]\n    cwe807[\"CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\"]\n\n    cwe620 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe472 -->|PEEROF| cwe620\n    cwe807 -->|PEEROF| cwe620\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe620 primary\n    class cwe472,cwe807 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient input sanitization** of the reset key, which leads to a bypassed check and finally results in an **unverified password change**, granting unauthorized access to the administrator account.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several potential CWEs. The root cause is the **improper sanitization** of the reset key, specifically, the use of `sanitize_text_field` which leads to a bypass of the intended security checks. This directly enables the unverified password change. The key evidence supporting this analysis is the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which states: \"The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Profile Builder plugin handles password reset keys. Specifically, the password reset key is checked against the password recovery key, but it's processed using `sanitize_text_field`. This function strips HTML tags.\" Also \"The fact that `sanitize_text_field` strips the HTML, and the application then checks if the key is empty is the root cause.\"\n\nCWE-620 is the most specific and appropriate choice because it directly addresses the core weakness: the ability to change a user's password without proper verification, which is the ultimate impact of the vulnerability.\nCWE-472 is also relevant, because the reset key, which should be immutable from the perspective of the application after it's been issued, is actually controllable by the user. This allows the user to manipulate it to bypass the security checks.\nCWE-807 is relevant as well, as the application relies on the reset key to make security decisions, but this key is ultimately untrusted and can be modified by an attacker.\n\nI am overriding the retriever results in the selection of CWE-620 because the other highly ranked CWEs are too general. CWE-472 and CWE-807 capture relevant aspects of the vulnerability but do not fully explain the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
