# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), which is a class-level CWE. While it is discouraged by MITRE due to its high-level nature, it directly aligns with the **resource exhaustion** weakness described in the vulnerability. The relationship between CWE-400 and its children, such as CWE-772 (Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime), was considered to provide a more specific classification. However, the description doesn't provide enough detail to confirm the precise mechanism causing the resource exhaustion.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **resource exhaustion** issue, which leads to running or pending jobs continuing even after the project is deleted. While the description doesn't detail the exact root cause, the problemtype in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentions "Improper Authorization". This could imply a missing or incorrect authorization check that would normally terminate the jobs upon project deletion.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on the **resource exhaustion** aspect, leading to the selection of CWE-400. However, the additional information about "Improper Authorization" suggests a more complex scenario where the lack of proper authorization contributes to the resource exhaustion.

The final decision is to select CWE-400 as the primary CWE due to its direct relevance to the described weakness. CWE-772 (Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) are considered as secondary CWEs, as they could be potential underlying causes. However, the evidence is insufficient to definitively confirm these as root causes.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the available evidence. While more specific variants of CWE-400 exist, the lack of detailed information prevents a more precise classification.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.83
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is "asymmetric."

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not initialize a critical resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 5914.74
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 5834.75
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in
