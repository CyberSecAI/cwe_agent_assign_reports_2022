CWE-79 is a base-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. While CWE-74 is a parent, CWE-79 is a more specific description of the issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  A remote attacker injects malicious HTML code. (Root Cause: **Improper Neutralization**)\n2.  The injected code is viewed by an authenticated victim.\n3.  The victim's browser executes the malicious code. (Impact: **Cross-site Scripting**)\nThe root cause is the **improper neutralization** of the injected HTML, which directly leads to the XSS vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, supported by both the vulnerability description and the provided data, strongly suggests CWE-79 as the most appropriate mapping. The vulnerability description clearly states that a remote attacker can inject malicious HTML code, leading to the execution of that code when viewed by an authenticated victim. This aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-79, which focuses on the **improper neutralization** of input during web page generation, resulting in Cross-site Scripting.\nThe evidence supporting this decision is the vulnerability description itself: \"IBM Cognos Analytics 11.0 and 11.1 could allow a remote attacker to inject malicious HTML code that when viewed by the authenticated victim would execute the code.\" This statement directly implies a lack of proper input neutralization, leading to XSS.\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-79 is a more specific instance of CWE-74, making it the better choice. The assessment is based on the provided evidence and graph relationships. The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
