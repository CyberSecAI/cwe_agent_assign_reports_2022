The retriever results also suggested using CWE-285 and CWE-862 as possible candidates, but these are Class level CWEs. CWE-939 is a child of CWE-862. Given that the vulnerability description specifically mentions the vulnerability exists in the handler for a custom URL scheme, CWE-939 is the most specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe939[\"CWE-939: Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe939 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe939 primary\n    class cwe862,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper authorization** in the handler for the custom URL scheme (CWE-939), which leads to the attacker being able to redirect the user to an arbitrary website.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is **improper authorization**. The vulnerability description clearly states \"**Improper authorization** in handler for custom URL scheme vulnerability\".\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary further clarifies that the app fails to properly restrict access permissions when launched using a custom URL scheme.\nBased on this evidence, and the retriever results, the primary CWE selected was CWE-939 (Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme).\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision by showing that CWE-939 is more specific than the other candidates (CWE-285, CWE-862), as it is a child of CWE-862, which is a child of CWE-285.\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately reflects the vulnerability, where the **improper authorization** occurs within the custom URL scheme handler.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
