It's a class-level CWE, and the documentation recommends checking child CWEs for a more specific match. It is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), which are higher-level abstractions.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves an **incorrect authorization** mechanism, leading to the ability to execute CLI commands.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command) as the primary CWE based on similar CVE descriptions. However, after a more thorough examination of the vulnerability description and the retriever results, it is clear that the core issue is related to authorization, not command injection.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that the attacker can **bypass authorization** and execute a subset of CLI commands. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the root cause is \"Incorrect authorization of non-interactive CLI commands\" and the weakness is a \"TACACS authorization bypass.\" This suggests that the system is not properly verifying whether the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to execute the requested CLI commands, which directly aligns with the description of CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization).\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) with a high score. The mapping guidance for CWE-863 suggests examining its children for a more specific match, but none of the children are more appropriate in this case. Therefore, CWE-863 is the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-863 is based on the following evidence:\n\n*   The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **\"bypass authorization.\"**\n*   The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the root cause is **\"Incorrect authorization.\"**\n*   The retriever results list CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) with a high score.\n\nCWE-78 was considered but rejected because the core issue is not related to command injection. While the attacker can execute CLI commands, this is a consequence of the **authorization bypass**, not the result of injecting malicious commands. Other CWEs like CWE-284 and CWE-285 are higher-level abstractions and less specific than CWE-863.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
