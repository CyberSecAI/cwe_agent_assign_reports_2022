This can lead to the injection of arbitrary code (CWE-94) because the system trusts unsigned or improperly signed code. The **lack of SSL certificate validation** (CWE-295) exacerbates the issue by allowing man-in-the-middle attacks, which can facilitate code injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe295[\"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe94 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe347\n    cwe295 -->|PEEROF| cwe347\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe295,cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of signature verification** (CWE-347) and **lack of SSL certificate validation** (CWE-295). This allows an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, inject arbitrary code (CWE-94), and ultimately execute arbitrary code on the user's system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **lack of proper signature verification** (CWE-347), which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code. The **lack of SSL certificate validation** (CWE-295) makes the MITM attack easier, and the code injection (CWE-94) leads to arbitrary code execution.\n\nThe selection is based on the evidence:\n- Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**lack of proper signature verification**\"\n- CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The primary cause is a **lack of proper signature verification** for code exchanged between the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) and its Launcher application.

The specific issue isn't a buffer overflow but a **lack of signature validation**, which allows for the injection of malicious code.\n*   **CWE-20 Improper Input Validation**: This is also too generic. The core issue isn't a failure to validate input in general, but the **lack of cryptographic signature verification**.\n*   **CWE-321 Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key**: There is no mention of hardcoded cryptographic keys.\n*   **CWE-250 Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**: There is no mention of privileges.",
