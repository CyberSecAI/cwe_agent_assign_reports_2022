The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section also states that the root cause of the vulnerability is the **missing authorisation and CSRF check**.\n\nThe retriever results lists both CWE-352 and CWE-862 as possible candidates.\n\nCWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a compound weakness that occurs when the web application does not sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request. In this case, the plugin does not have a CSRF check in place, so any authenticated user can delete arbitrary publications. The usage for CWE-352 is ALLOWED.\n\nCWE-862 Missing Authorization is a class that occurs when the product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. In this case, the plugin does not have proper authorization in place, so any authenticated user can delete arbitrary publications. The usage for CWE-862 is ALLOWED-WITH-REVIEW because it is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate. However, there is no further information to select a more specific child.\n\nGiven that the vulnerability description explicitly states that both authorisation and CSRF checks are missing, I have selected both CWE-352 and CWE-862. I am choosing to map both CWE-352 and CWE-862 because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions both.\n\nI considered CWE-285 Improper Authorization, but its usage is Discouraged and it is a parent of CWE-862, which is a better fit.\nI considered CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization, but the vulnerability description states that authorisation is missing, not incorrect.\nI considered CWE-425 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'), but this CWE describes missing authorization on restricted URLs, scripts, or files, which is not explicitly stated in the vulnerability description.\nI considered CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key, but the vulnerability description does not state that the authorization is bypassed through a user-controlled key.\n\nI am confident in my assessment, given the explicit evidence provided in the vulnerability description.",
