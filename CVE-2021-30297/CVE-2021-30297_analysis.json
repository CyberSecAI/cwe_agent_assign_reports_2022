The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a possible **out-of-bounds read**. CWE-125 is a base level CWE, providing sufficient specificity.\n\nCWE-1284, is a secondary weakness where the product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read if the quantity is used to determine the buffer size. CWE-1284 can precede CWE-125 in a vulnerability chain.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper validation of packet length** (CWE-1284) which leads to an **out of bound read** (CWE-125).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"Possible **out of bound read due to improper validation of packet length** while handling data transfer in VR service\".\n\nCWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) aligns directly with the stated impact of the vulnerability. The description of CWE-125 states: \"The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\" The vulnerability description uses almost identical wording.\n\nCWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) addresses that the **improper validation of packet length**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-125 is based on the clear statement within the vulnerability description of a possible **out-of-bounds read**. It is a Base level CWE, providing a good level of specificity. The relationship diagram shows how this can be caused by CWE-1284.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## Vulnerability Description\nPossible out of bound read due to **improper validation of packet length** while handling data transfer in VR service in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **impact:** out of bound read\n- **vector:** handling data transfer\n- **product:** Snapdragon\n- **component:** VR service",
