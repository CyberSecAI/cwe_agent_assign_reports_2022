We chose CWE-862 because the vulnerability stems from the **lack of an authorization check** within the `getSelectedMimeTypesByRole` function, making it more specific than its parents.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n\n1.  **ROOT CAUSE:** **Missing Authorization** in the `getSelectedMimeTypesByRole` function (CWE-862).\n2.  **WEAKNESS:** Low-level authenticated users can access sensitive data.\n3.  **IMPACT:** Information Disclosure (view custom extensions added by administrators).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment pointed towards a clear **missing authorization** issue. The vulnerability description and CVE details confirm the **lack of access control** in the specified function, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n\nEvidence: \"The vulnerability stems from a **lack of access control** in the `getSelectedMimeTypesByRole` function within the \"WP Upload Restriction\" plugin\"\n\nThe retriever results listed CWE-862 **[Missing Authorization]** as a candidate. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states that there is insufficient access control in the `getSelectedMimeTypesByRole` function, which allows unauthenticated users to retrieve approved mime types for any given role.\n\nThe relationships influenced the selection by guiding towards the most specific CWE. While CWE-285 **[Improper Authorization]** and CWE-284 **[Improper Access Control]** are applicable, CWE-862 **[Missing Authorization]** directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately reflects the **missing authorization check**, which is the core issue enabling unauthorized access.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-862 **[Missing Authorization]**\n- CWE-285 **[Improper Authorization]**\n- CWE-284 **[Improper Access Control]**",
