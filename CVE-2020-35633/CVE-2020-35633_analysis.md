# Analysis for CVE-2020-35633

# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name  | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| CWE-843 | Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.9 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-843, which relates to type confusion. CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is identified as a secondary CWE, as the out-of-bounds read can precede or contribute to the type confusion. Both are at the Base abstraction level, which is preferred.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a malformed file leading to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125), which then results in **type confusion** (CWE-843), potentially leading to code execution. The missing link here is how type confusion leads to code execution, which is an impact and not necessarily a CWE.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified **out-of-bounds read** and **type confusion** as key issues. The retriever results highlighted CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) and CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')).

The vulnerability description explicitly states: "An oob read vulnerability exists" and "specially crafted malformed file can lead to an **out-of-bounds read** and **type confusion**, which could lead to code execution."

CWE-125 directly addresses the **out-of-bounds read** condition.

CWE-843 accurately captures the **type confusion** aspect, where a resource is accessed using an incompatible type.

The relationship analysis shows that CWE-125 can precede CWE-843, indicating a potential vulnerability chain.

I am selecting both CWE-125 and CWE-843 as they directly address the identified weaknesses. CWE-843 is considered primary because type confusion is a higher-level issue that arises from the out-of-bounds read. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, providing an appropriate level of specificity.

CWE-129 (Improper Validation of Array Index) was considered because it often leads to out-of-bounds reads. However, the description does not explicitly state that the array index was improperly validated. Therefore, CWE-125 is more appropriate. CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) was considered but is not as directly relevant as CWE-125 since the initial problem is a read.

# Relevant CWE Information:
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-704: Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly convert an object, resource, or structure from one type to a different type.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
An algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 3480.86
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
