CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, while CWE-862 is a Class. This hierarchical relationship indicates that CWE-862 provides a more specific and appropriate classification for the vulnerability than its parent CWE-284.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: the **missing authorization check** (root cause) leads to the ability to **modify users permissions** (impact).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which clearly states that the Single Connect application, when using the sc-assigned-credential-ui module, does not perform an authorization check. This **missing authorization check** allows a remote attacker to modify user permissions, potentially deleting permissions from other users without authenticating.\n\nThe evidence for this is:\n- \"**rootcause:** **missing authorization check**\"\n- \"**impact:** modify users permissions\"\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), which aligns perfectly with the **missing authorization check**. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) was considered but deemed too high-level. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-862 is a more specific child of CWE-284, making it the more appropriate choice.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **missing authorization check**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
