CWE-522 is a class-level CWE that represents the more general case of credentials not being adequately protected. The relationship between CWE-312 and CWE-522 is that CWE-312 can be considered a more specific type of insufficient credential protection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe311,cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is simple: the **weakness** is that the application **stores user credentials in plain clear text**. The impact is that a locally authenticated user can read these credentials.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary **weakness** is that the application **stores user credentials in plain clear text**.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states that IBM Security Verify Bridge 1.0.5.0 **stores user credentials in plain clear text**. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information), which states: \"The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\" The vulnerability description also identifies a locally authenticated user as the attacker, which satisfies the \"accessible to another control sphere\" requirement of CWE-312.\n\nCWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) was considered as a potential candidate, but it is a more general class of weakness. Since the vulnerability description specifically mentions that the credentials are stored in \"plain clear text\", CWE-312 is a more precise and appropriate mapping. Also, the mapping guidance for CWE-522 suggests examining its children for a better fit.\n\nThe retriever results also show CWE-312 with a high score, further supporting its selection as the primary CWE.\n\nThe analysis is based on the explicit statement in the vulnerability description. The relationship analysis showed that CWE-312 is a specific case of CWE-522. The retriever results provided additional confidence in the selection of CWE-312.\n\nCWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) was considered, but it is not applicable because the vulnerability involves storage, not transmission, of sensitive information.\nCWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) was considered, but the description indicates that the application stores *user credentials* which may encompass more than just passwords.\nCWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) was not considered because the credentials are not being logged.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-312 directly reflects the stated **weakness** of storing sensitive information in cleartext, while acknowledging that a more generalized class of vulnerability exists in CWE-522.",
