CWE-78, a Base-level CWE, is a child of CWE-77 and represents OS command injection, a more specific type of command injection. CWE-184, Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs, can precede command injection vulnerabilities by failing to adequately filter malicious input.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe184 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe77 primary\n    class cwe78,cwe184 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a potential **incomplete list of disallowed inputs** (CWE-184), which allows an attacker to inject malicious commands. The device then fails to properly neutralize special elements in the command (CWE-77), leading to command execution. The end result is the attacker gaining control of the device.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"**command injection** by an unauthenticated attacker.\" The primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions is CWE-79, but this is \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\" and not the best fit. The Top CWEs include CWE-77, CWE-787, and CWE-77. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates \"a pre-authentication **command injection** vulnerability,\" further supporting the selection of a command injection CWE.\n\nThe Retriever Results list CWE-77 as the top candidate. CWE-77 is \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\" and is a Class-level CWE. The Mapping Guidance suggests Allowed-with-Review and warns that CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was intended instead. However, since the initial description uses the broader term \"command injection\", CWE-77 is a better fit.\n\nCWE-78, \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\" is the second candidate from the Retriever Results and is a child of CWE-77. It is a Base-level CWE and the Mapping Guidance says it is Allowed. Since the advisory describes a generic **command injection** and does not specify that it is limited to OS commands, CWE-77 is selected. However, CWE-78 is included as a secondary candidate since it is possible the injected command is an OS command.\n\nCWE-184, \"Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\" is also considered as a secondary weakness, because the root cause might be due to **missing** some special elements that should be neutralized.\n\nTherefore, CWE-77 is the most appropriate primary CWE because the vulnerability description states \"**command injection**\" which is a general type of command injection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE is not related to the command injection vulnerability.*\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE is not related to the command injection vulnerability.*\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n*This CWE is not related to the command injection vulnerability.*\n\n## CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE is not related to the command injection vulnerability.*\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE is not related to the command injection vulnerability.*\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
