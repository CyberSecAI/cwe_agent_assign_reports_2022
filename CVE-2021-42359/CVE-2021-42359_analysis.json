CWE-862 and CWE-306 are more specific and accurately represent the **lack of** authorization and authentication, respectively.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe306 -->|ChildOf| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses begins with the **lack of** capability and nonce checks on the AJAX action, leading to unauthenticated users being able to delete arbitrary posts and pages.\n  - Root Cause: **Missing** Authorization (CWE-862) and Authentication (CWE-306).\n  - Impact: Deletion of arbitrary posts or pages.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified a **lack of** authorization and authentication as the primary weakness, allowing unauthenticated users to delete arbitrary posts. The retriever results suggested CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) along with other candidates. Based on the vulnerability description and the provided information, CWE-862 and CWE-306 were selected as the most appropriate CWEs.\n\nThe selection is primarily based on the following evidence:\n*   \"**lacking a capability check and a nonce check**\"\n*   \"was available to unauthenticated users\"\n*   \"The plugin's AJAX action `admin-dismiss-unsubscribe`, intended for administrators to dismiss data removal requests, was accessible to unauthenticated users.\"\n\nCWE-862 and CWE-306 are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **missing** authorization and authentication checks, respectively. This is more accurate than the more general CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), as there weren't any authorization or authentication checks to begin with.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
