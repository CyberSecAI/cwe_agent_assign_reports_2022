## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** (CWE-22), which leads to **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** (CWE-200).

## Summary of Analysis
Initially, the analysis focused on identifying the root cause, which is the **Local File Disclosure** vulnerability stemming from **lack of proper input validation and sanitization** in the Patreon WordPress plugin. The plugin uses the `$_REQUEST['patron_only_image']` parameter to construct the path to an image without proper validation, leading to a path traversal vulnerability. This allows an attacker to access files outside the intended upload directory, leading to the disclosure of sensitive files such as `wp-config.php`.

The primary CWE considered was CWE-22, **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**, as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability. However, the ultimate impact is the disclosure of sensitive information. Therefore, CWE-200, **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**, was also considered as the primary weakness based on MITRE mapping guidance. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" highlights that attackers can potentially access sensitive information, such as database credentials, secret keys, and other configuration data stored in files like `wp-config.php`, which can lead to a full site takeover.

Although CWE-200 is discouraged as it is often misused, in this case it accurately reflects the high-level impact of the vulnerability: **Sensitive Data Exposure**. The retriever results also list CWE-200 with a similarity score of 0.327. The vulnerability allows "anyone visiting the site" to "leak important internal files like wp-config.php, which contains database credentials and cryptographic keys." This aligns with CWE-200's description: "The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information."

CWE-22 is included to specify the technical weakness that allowed the exposure of sensitive information.

The final decision is based on the evidence that the primary impact is the exposure of sensitive data due to the path traversal vulnerability. CWE-200 captures this impact, while CWE-22 explains the technical flaw that enables it.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-24227

## Vulnerability Description
The Jetpack Scan team identified a **Local File Disclosure** vulnerability in the Patreon WordPress plugin before 1.7.0 that could be abused by anyone visiting the site. Using this attack vector, an attacker could leak important internal files like wp-config.php, which contains database credentials and cryptographic keys used in the generation of nonces and cookies.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **Local File Disclosure**
- **impact:** leak important internal files
- **attacker:** anyone visiting the site
- **product:** Patreon WordPress plugin
- **version:** before 1.7.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described as CVE-2021-24227:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation and sanitization when serving patron-only images. Specifically, the plugin uses the `$_REQUEST['patron_only_image']` parameter to construct the path to an image without verifying if the requested file is within the intended upload directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can manipulate the `patron_only_image` parameter to access files outside of the intended uploads directory, leading to the disclosure of sensitive files such as `wp-config.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive information, such as database credentials, secret keys, and other configuration data stored in files like `wp-config.php`, which can lead to a full site takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the `patron_only_image` parameter in an HTTP request. The vulnerable code retrieves the image path from user-controlled input (`$_REQUEST['patron_only_image']`) and concatenates it into a file path without sufficient sanitization or validation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need any prior access to the WordPress site. They can exploit the vulnerability simply by visiting the website and crafting a malicious request.
- **Knowledge of WordPress Directory Structure:** A basic understanding of the typical WordPress directory structure, particularly the location of `wp-config.php` and other sensitive files, would help the attacker in targeting specific files.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided code snippet shows the vulnerable function `servePatronOnlyImage`, which takes a potentially attacker-controlled image path, constructs a URL, and then serves that URL using `Patreon_Protect::readAndServeImage`.
- The code does attempt to get the attachment id, but fails to properly validate the full file path beforehand.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.7.0 of the plugin.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

### Extended Description


There are many different kinds of mistakes that introduce information exposures. The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include:


  - private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details

  - system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages

  - business secrets and intellectual property

  - network status and configuration

  - the product's own code or internal state

  - metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers

  - indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider

Information might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include:

  - the product's own users

  - people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users

  - the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates

  - the developer

Information exposures can occur in different ways:

  - the code  **explicitly inserts**  sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been "scrubbed" or "sanitized"

  - a different weakness or mistake  **indirectly inserts**  the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.

  - the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are  **unintentionally made accessible**  to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.

It is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an "information exposure," but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.

### Alternative Terms
Information Disclosure: This term is frequently used in vulnerability advisories to describe a consequence or technical impact, for any vulnerability that has a loss of confidentiality. Often, CWE-200 can be misused to represent the loss of confidentiality, even when the mistake - i.e., the weakness - is not directly related to the mishandling of the information itself, such as an out-of-bounds read that accesses sensitive memory contents; here, the out-of-bounds read is the primary weakness, not the disclosure of the memory. In addition, this phrase is also used frequently in policies and legal documents, but it does not refer to any disclosure of security-relevant information.
Information Leak: This is a frequently used term, however the "leak" term has multiple uses within security. In some cases it deals with the accidental exposure of information from a different weakness, but in other cases (such as "memory leak"), this deals with improper tracking of resources, which can lead to exhaustion. As a result, CWE is actively avoiding usage of the "leak" term.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].
**Comments:** If an error or mistake causes information to be disclosed, then use the CWE ID for that error. Consider starting with improper authorization (CWE-285), insecure permissions (CWE-732), improper authentication (CWE-287), etc. Also consider children such as Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201), Observable Discrepancy (CWE-203), Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory (CWE-538), or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** As a result of mapping analysis in the 2020 Top 25 and more recent versions, this weakness is under review, since it is frequently misused in mapping to cover many problems that lead to loss of confidentiality. See Mapping Notes, Extended Description, and Alternate Terms.

**Abstraction:** Compound
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

### Extended Description
When a web server is designed to receive a request from a client without any mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it might be possible for an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.

### Alternative Terms
Session Riding
Cross Site Reference Forgery
XSRF

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-345
ChildOf -> CWE-345
Requires -> CWE-346
Requires -> CWE-441
Requires -> CWE-642
Requires -> CWE-613

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.
**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine if other weaknesses allow CSRF attacks to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable CSRF tokens might allow bypass of CSRF protection mechanisms; if this occurs, they might be better characterized as randomness/predictability weaknesses.
**Reasons:**
- Other


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.


**[Theoretical]** 

The CSRF topology is multi-channel:


  - Attacker (as outsider) to intermediary (as user). The interaction point is either an external or internal channel.

  - Intermediary (as user) to server (as victim). The activation point is an internal channel.





### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2004-1703:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag
- **CVE-2004-1995:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag
- **CVE-2004-1967:** Arbitrary code execution by specifying the code in a crafted img tag or URL




## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

### Extended Description


When resources are released, they can be made available for reuse. For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information.


Even when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.


This weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-459
ChildOf -> CWE-212
CanPrecede -> CWE-201

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE research view (CWE-1000).

**[Maintenance]** This entry needs modification to clarify the differences with CWE-212. The description also combines two problems that are distinct from the CWE research perspective: the inadvertent transfer of information to another sphere, and improper initialization/shutdown. Some of the associated taxonomy mappings reflect these different uses.

**[Research Gap]** This is frequently found for network packets, but it can also exist in local memory allocation, files, etc.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-3733:** Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release
- **CVE-2003-0001:** Ethernet NIC drivers do not pad frames with null bytes, leading to infoleak from malformed packets.
- **CVE-2003-0291:** router does not clear information from DHCP packets that have been previously used




## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-522

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.




## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

### Extended Description
When product generates predictable values in a context requiring unpredictability, it may be possible for an attacker to guess the next value that will be generated, and use this guess to impersonate another user or access sensitive information.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-693
CanPrecede -> CWE-804

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This can be primary to many other weaknesses such as cryptographic errors, authentication errors, symlink following, information leaks, and others.

**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.3, CWE-330 and its descendants are being investigated by the CWE crypto team to identify gaps related to randomness and unpredictability, as well as the relationships between randomness and cryptographic primitives. This "subtree analysis" might result in the addition or deprecation of existing entries; the reorganization of relationships in some views, e.g. the research view (CWE-1000); more consistent use of terminology; and/or significant modifications to related entries.

**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-3692:** PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens
- **CVE-2020-7010:** Cloud application on Kubernetes generates passwords using a weak random number generator based on deployment time.
- **CVE-2009-3278:** Crypto product uses rand() library function to generate a recovery key, making it easier to conduct brute force attacks.




## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships

ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-3597:** Web application stores database file under the web root with insufficient access control (CWE-219), allowing direct request.
