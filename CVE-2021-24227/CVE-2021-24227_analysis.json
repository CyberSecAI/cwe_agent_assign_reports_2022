The plugin uses the `$_REQUEST['patron_only_image']` parameter to construct the path to an image without proper validation, leading to a path traversal vulnerability. This allows an attacker to access files outside the intended upload directory, leading to the disclosure of sensitive files such as `wp-config.php`.\n\nThe primary CWE considered was CWE-22, **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**, as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability. However, the ultimate impact is the disclosure of sensitive information. Therefore, CWE-200, **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**, was also considered as the primary weakness based on MITRE mapping guidance. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" highlights that attackers can potentially access sensitive information, such as database credentials, secret keys, and other configuration data stored in files like `wp-config.php`, which can lead to a full site takeover.\n\nAlthough CWE-200 is discouraged as it is often misused, in this case it accurately reflects the high-level impact of the vulnerability: **Sensitive Data Exposure**. The retriever results also list CWE-200 with a similarity score of 0.327. The vulnerability allows \"anyone visiting the site\" to \"leak important internal files like wp-config.php, which contains database credentials and cryptographic keys.\" This aligns with CWE-200's description: \"The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\"\n\nCWE-22 is included to specify the technical weakness that allowed the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence that the primary impact is the exposure of sensitive data due to the path traversal vulnerability. CWE-200 captures this impact, while CWE-22 explains the technical flaw that enables it.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
