## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-122** Heap-based Buffer Overflow, a variant of **CWE-787** Out-of-bounds Write. The root cause is **CWE-1284** Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input, as the `wLength` parameter is not validated against the buffer size. This leads to out-of-bounds writes and reads (**CWE-125**). **CWE-119** Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer is a class-level CWE and too general.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is as follows:
1.  **CWE-1284** Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input: The `wLength` parameter is not properly validated.
2.  **CWE-122** Heap-based Buffer Overflow: An attacker-controlled `wLength` value larger than the buffer size is used in `memcpy`, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
3.  **CWE-125** Out-of-bounds Read: When responding to certain commands or after processing the `DFU_DNLOAD` command, the code uses the attacker-controlled `wLength` to determine how much data to send back to the host, potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory reads and information disclosure.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis indicates a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability due to **improper input validation**. The primary CWE is **CWE-122**, which aligns with the vulnerability description's key phrases and CVE reference links content summary.

The CVE reference links content summary states:
- **Weakness:** **Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122)**
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `wLength` parameter from a USB control transfer request, which determines the amount of data to be copied, is not properly validated against the buffer size (`CONFIG_USB_REQUEST_BUFFER_SIZE`). This allows an attacker to specify a `wLength` value larger than the buffer, leading to out-of-bounds memory access during `memcpy`.
- **Buffer Overflow (CWE-122):** The primary vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking before the `memcpy` operation.
- **Out-of-bounds Read:** ...the code uses the attacker-controlled `wLength` to determine how much data to send back to the host, potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory reads and information disclosure since `wLength` can be larger than the actual buffer.

**CWE-122** is the most specific and appropriate CWE for this vulnerability. **CWE-125** is a secondary effect due to the overflow. **CWE-1284** is the root cause because the code fails to validate the specified quantity in the input.

## Vulnerability Description
Buffer overflow in Zephyr USB DFU DNLOAD. Zephyr versions >= v2.5.0 contain **Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122)**. For more information, see https//github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/security/advisories/GHSA-c3gr-hgvr-f363

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122)**
- **product:** Zephyr USB DFU DNLOAD
- **version:** >= v2.5.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Zephyr USB DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade) implementation, specifically in the `DFU_DNLOAD` request handling within `usb_dfu.c`. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `wLength` parameter from a USB control transfer request, which determines the amount of data to be copied, is not properly validated against the buffer size (`CONFIG_USB_REQUEST_BUFFER_SIZE`). This allows an attacker to specify a `wLength` value larger than the buffer, leading to out-of-bounds memory access during `memcpy`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Buffer Overflow (CWE-122):**  The primary vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking before the `memcpy` operation. Specifically, the `memcpy` in the `DFU_DNLOAD` handler copies data from `*data` to `dfu_data_worker.buf` using `pSetup->wLength` as the size argument, without ensuring that this size does not exceed the buffer size of `dfu_data_worker.buf`.
    - **Information Leak:** Because the worker copies the oversized data to memory, it can be written to flash. Then, since the attacker can read out flash contents using the DFU UPLOAD command, this represents an information leak.
    - **Out-of-bounds Read:** The vulnerability extends to read operations.  When responding to certain commands (like `DFU_ABORT`, `DFU_CLRSTATUS`, `DFU_DETACH`) or when responding to the host after processing the `DFU_DNLOAD` command, the code uses the attacker-controlled `wLength` to determine how much data to send back to the host, potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory reads and information disclosure since `wLength` can be larger than the actual buffer. The `usb_data_to_host` function in `usb_device.c` uses `setup->wLength`, potentially sending out more bytes than the allocated buffer size and leaking contents.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the `dfu_data_worker.buf`, an attacker could potentially overwrite adjacent data structures in memory, leading to arbitrary code execution.
    - **Memory Corruption:**  Out-of-bounds writes can corrupt data structures, leading to instability or unexpected behavior.
    - **Information Leakage:** Reading past the buffer boundaries allows an attacker to potentially leak sensitive data from memory.
    - **Flash leakage:** Because the overflow data is written to flash, this data can be read out using DFU UPLOAD, leaking flash data.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attack vector is adjacent. It exploits the USB DFU interface. The attacker sends a crafted USB control transfer request to the vulnerable device.
    -  The attacker needs to send a `DFU_DNLOAD` request with a `wLength` value larger than `CONFIG_USB_REQUEST_BUFFER_SIZE`. They also need to send a `bmRequestType` with direction set to `TO_HOST` (device to host).
    - For the out-of-bounds read, the attacker can send other commands like `DFU_ABORT`, `DFU_CLRSTATUS` or `DFU_DETACH` with a large `wLength`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs physical or logical access to the USB interface of the target device.
    -  They must be able to craft and send USB control transfer requests to the device, specifically `DFU_DNLOAD` requests and also other commands such as `DFU_ABORT`, `DFU_CLRSTATUS` or `DFU_DETACH` with an attacker-controlled `wLength`.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-118
ChildOf -> CWE-20

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist




## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Overflow: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
Wraparound: The terms "overflow" and "wraparound" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.
wrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of "wraparound"

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-682
ChildOf -> CWE-20
CanPrecede -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with "overflow," "underflow," and "wraparound" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called "underflows").


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.

**[Terminology]** 

"Integer overflow" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.


A "wraparound" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.


"Overflow" is sometimes conflated with "wraparound" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.


The "overflow" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use "overflow" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using "underflow" for exceeding the minimum.


Some people use "overflow" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses "underflow" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.


See [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.


**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.




## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

### Extended Description
This can happen in signed and unsigned cases.

### Alternative Terms
Integer underflow: 

"Integer underflow" is sometimes used to identify signedness errors in which an originally positive number becomes negative as a result of subtraction. However, there are cases of bad subtraction in which unsigned integers are involved, so it's not always a signedness issue.


"Integer underflow" is occasionally used to describe array index errors in which the index is negative.

- **CVE-2004-1002:** Integer underflow by packet with invalid length.
- **CVE-2005-0199:** Long input causes incorrect length calculation.




## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.

### Extended Description
If an attacker can manipulate the length parameter associated with an input such that it is inconsistent with the actual length of the input, this can be leveraged to cause the target application to behave in unexpected, and possibly, malicious ways. One of the possible motives for doing so is to pass in arbitrarily large input to the application. Another possible motivation is the modification of application state by including invalid data for subsequent properties of the application. Such weaknesses commonly lead to attacks such as buffer overflows and execution of arbitrary code.

- **CVE-2009-2299:** Web application firewall consumes excessive memory when an HTTP request contains a large Content-Length value but no POST data.
- **CVE-2001-0825:** Buffer overflow in internal string handling routine allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a length argument of zero or less, which disables the length check.




## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().

- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).




## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

### Extended Description
This typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.

### Alternative Terms

- **CVE-2022-2639:** Chain: integer coercion error (CWE-192) prevents a return value from indicating an error, leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)




## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

### Extended Description


Specified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).
- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop
- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read
