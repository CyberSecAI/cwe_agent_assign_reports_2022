CWE-425 and CWE-306 are related, as **forced browsing** and **missing authentication** can lead to bypassing intended security measures. CWE-201 could be a contributing factor if sensitive information is exposed through the redirection process. The relationships include:\n\n*   CWE-288 ChildOf CWE-306 (in some cases, missing authentication can lead to an alternate path being used)\n*   CWE-425 ChildOf CWE-288 (Forced browsing is an instance of authentication bypass)\n*   CWE-425 CanPrecede CWE-471 (Forced browsing can lead to Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data)\n*   CWE-201 CanAlsoBe CWE-209 (Information exposure can manifest as an error message)\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe471[\"CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe288\n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe306\n    cwe425 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe471\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe209\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe288 primary\n    class cwe425,cwe306,cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper access control**, leading to **authentication bypass** through **redirection manipulation**, and ultimately resulting in the ability to view information as Admin, which constitutes **information disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **authentication bypass** as the primary weakness, supported by evidence in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The Retriever Results also highlighted CWE-288, CWE-425 and CWE-306 as relevant.\n\nThe description clearly states that \"Authentication can be bypassed\" and \"a user may view information as Admin by manually browsing to the setup wizard and forcing it to redirect to the desired page.\" This directly supports CWE-288.\n\nThe graph relationships further clarify the connections between the different weaknesses, with CWE-288 as the central issue enabling other potential vulnerabilities.
