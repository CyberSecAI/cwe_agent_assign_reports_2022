## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 1.0 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), a variant of CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). CWE-119 is a more general class of weakness, while CWE-121 specifically identifies the overflow occurring on the stack. The relationship between these CWEs influenced the decision to choose the more specific CWE-121 as the primary mapping.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain involves an authenticated user triggering a **stack-based buffer overflow**.
  - Root Cause: **Stack-based buffer overflow** (CWE-121).
  - Impact: Potential for code execution, denial of service.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis strongly points towards a buffer overflow, specifically on the stack.

Evidence:
- Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: "**stack-based buffer overflow**"
- CVE Reference Links Content Summary: "**Root cause of vulnerability:** Post-authentication stack overflow.", "**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack overflow vulnerability."

The retriever results list CWE-119 as the top combined result, but the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a "stack-based buffer overflow". The CWE for similar CVE Descriptions lists CWE-787 as the Primary CWE Match, and CWE-121 is a child of CWE-787. Given the explicit mention of "stack-based", CWE-121 is the most specific and appropriate choice. CWE-119 is considered as a secondary candidate due to its general nature as an improper restriction of operations within a memory buffer.

The selection of CWE-121 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately captures the location of the buffer overflow (stack) and the nature of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.

## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is "asymmetric."

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.

## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6752.17
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

**Mapping Guidance**:
