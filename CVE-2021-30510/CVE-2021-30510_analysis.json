CWE-416 can be preceded by CWE-120 **(Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow'))** or CWE-123 **(Write-what-where Condition)**. The secondary CWE is CWE-366 **(Race Condition within a Thread)**, which is a Base level weakness and a ChildOf CWE-362 **(Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'))** and CWE-662 **(Improper Synchronization)**. These relationships helped refine the classification to the most specific and accurate CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe366[\"CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource after Expiration\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe662[\"CWE-662: Improper Synchronization\"]\n\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe366 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe366 -->|CHILDOF| cwe662\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe366 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (CWE-366) in the Aura component of Google Chrome. This **race condition** leads to a **use-after-free** vulnerability (CWE-416), ultimately resulting in potential heap corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-416 **(Use After Free)** because the vulnerability description clearly states \"**Use after free** in Aura in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.212 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.\" This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-416: \"The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also indicates a \"**race condition** exists in the Aura component of the Chromium browser.\", which led to the secondary weakness of CWE-366 **(Race Condition within a Thread)**.\n\nCWE-415 **(Double Free)** was considered, but it was less appropriate because the primary issue is using memory after it has been freed, not freeing the same memory twice. While heap corruption is a potential impact, the root cause is the **use-after-free** condition.\n\nThe selection of CWE-416 is at the Variant level, which is the preferred level of abstraction, according to the MITRE mapping guidance. The selection of CWE-366 is at the Base level, which is also the preferred level of abstraction, according to the MITRE mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25

Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-911: Improper
