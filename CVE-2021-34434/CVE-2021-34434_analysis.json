It has parent-child relationships with CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284. The vulnerability involves an authorization check not being correctly performed, aligning with the description of CWE-863.\nCWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) is a base-level CWE and a more specific instance of authorization bypass, but the provided evidence doesn't explicitly point to a user-controlled key being the root cause.\nCWE-285 is a higher-level class that is not appropriate to use.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe639 -->|RELATED| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe639,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  A client subscribes to a topic.\n2.  The client disconnects.\n3.  The admin revokes the client's privilege.\n4.  The client reconnects and retains the subscription due to the **incorrect authorization** mechanism.\n\nThe root cause is the **improper authorization** that fails to revoke existing subscriptions when a durable client is offline. The impact is the attacker retaining subscription privileges.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as the primary candidate, which aligns with the **weakness** described in the CVE summary: \"**Improper Authorization**\". The description clearly states that \"existing subscriptions for that client are **not revoked**,\" indicating an issue with the authorization process.\n\nThe Retriever Results also lists CWE-863 as the top combined result.\n\nCWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) was considered because it is a more specific case of authorization bypass. However, the provided information doesn't explicitly state that the bypass occurs through a user-controlled key. The evidence indicates that the authorization mechanism itself **fails to revoke** the subscription, not that the user is manipulating a key to bypass authorization.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was also considered. However, CWE-863 is a child of CWE-285 and is a more specific classification, making it a better fit. The mapping guidance for CWE-285 discourages its use when lower-level CWEs are available.\n\nThe final decision to select CWE-863 is based on the following evidence:\n\n*   The CVE summary explicitly mentions \"**Improper Authorization**\" as the **weakness**.\n*   The vulnerability description states that \"existing subscriptions...are **not revoked**,\" indicating a failure in the authorization check.\n*   CWE-863's description matches the vulnerability: \"The product performs an authorization check...but it does not correctly perform the check.\"\n*   CWE-863 is the top result in the Retriever Results.\n*   CWE-863's mapping guidance suggests considering more specific children, but none are a better fit than CWE-863 itself.\n\nThe confidence in this mapping is high (1.0) due to the direct evidence and the alignment with the CWE's description.\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it accurately represents the **incorrect authorization** **weakness** without being overly specific or generic.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n-

Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using
