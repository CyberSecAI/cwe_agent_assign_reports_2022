The more specific CWE that may apply is CWE-1287, a base-level CWE, because the **input validation issue** involves a specific type of input. CWE-20 is a parent of CWE-1287.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe1287[\"CWE-1287: Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input\"]\n    \n    cwe1287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe1287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **input validation issue** (CWE-20), which leads to the ability to bypass Internet permission requirements.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identifies CWE-20 as the primary weakness due to the **input validation issue**. The analysis also considers CWE-1287, as the validation issue relates to a specific type of input, and it's a child of CWE-20.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"An **input validation issue** was addressed with improved input validation... A shortcut may be able to bypass Internet permission requirements.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section also indicates that the **root cause of the vulnerability** is an **input validation issue** and the **weakness** is **improper input validation** in ActionKit.\n\nThe selection of CWE-20 is based on the clear evidence of an **input validation issue**. However, CWE-20 is a Class-level CWE and the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. The description mentions a shortcut bypassing Internet permission requirements, suggesting a specific type of input is not being validated properly. Therefore, CWE-1287 is also considered as a more specific alternative or addition.\n\nThe final decision is to use CWE-20 as the primary CWE due to the broad nature of the vulnerability description. However, CWE-1287 is included as a secondary CWE to reflect the more specific nature of the **input validation issue**, which appears to involve a specific type of input that leads to bypassing permission requirements.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-657: Violation of Secure Design Principles\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product violates well-established principles for secure design.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
