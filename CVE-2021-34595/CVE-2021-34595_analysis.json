The vulnerability description states \"crafted request with invalid offsets may cause an out-of-bounds read or write access\". CWE-823 captures the root cause of the vulnerability which is the **use of an out-of-range pointer offset**. CWE-823 can precede both CWE-125 and CWE-787, indicating that an out-of-range pointer offset can lead to out-of-bounds read or write operations. CWE-823 is a child of CWE-119.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe823[\"CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe823 -->|CanPrecede| cwe125\n    cwe823 -->|CanPrecede| cwe787\n    cwe823 -->|ChildOf| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe823 primary\n    class cwe125,cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **crafted request with invalid offsets (root cause)** which leads to an **out-of-bounds read or write access** and results in a **denial-of-service or local memory overwrite (impact)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified that the vulnerability involves a crafted request with invalid offsets leading to out-of-bounds read or write access. The retriever results highlighted CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset), CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as potential candidates.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-823 as the root cause is the **use of an out-of-range pointer offset** due to the crafted request with invalid offsets. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"invalid offsets may cause an out-of-bounds read or write access,\" which directly aligns with the description of CWE-823. The other CWEs such as CWE-125 and CWE-787 represent the impact of the vulnerability (out-of-bounds read and write), respectively, but not the root cause. Therefore, these are included as secondary candidates.\n\nThe CWEs selected are at the optimal level of specificity (Base level) as they directly represent the root cause and impacts described in the vulnerability. The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, specifically the statement \"A crafted request with invalid offsets can cause an out-of-bounds read or write access,\" strongly supports the selection of CWE-823 as the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
