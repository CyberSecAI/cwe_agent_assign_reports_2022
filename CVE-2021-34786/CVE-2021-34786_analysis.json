The application performs authorization checks but does so incorrectly.|\n| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 0.7 | Base | Not Applicable | Secondary Candidate. Although authentication is mentioned, the core issue is with authorization after authentication.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization. This is a child of CWE-285 Improper Authorization and CWE-284 Improper Access Control, indicating a hierarchical relationship where the vulnerability is a specific type of authorization failure. CWE-287 Improper Authentication is a peer of CWE-863, but less relevant as authentication is present, but the authorization is **incorrect**. The abstraction levels influenced the selection, favoring the more specific Class-level CWE-863 over the higher-level Pillar CWE-284.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|ChildOf| cwe284\n    cwe287 -->|PeerOf| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **improper authorization checks** in the Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software. This allows an authenticated remote attacker with read-only system administrator privileges to delete arbitrary user accounts, leading to a disruption of services.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified that the vulnerability is rooted in **improper authorization checks**. This assessment is primarily based on the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which states, \"The vulnerability is due to **improper authorization checks** on operations within the web-based management interface of Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software. Specifically, the application does not properly validate if a user with read-only system administrator privileges is authorized to perform account deletion.\"\n\nThe graph relationships highlight that CWE-863 is a specific type of authorization failure, making it more suitable than its parent classes, CWE-285 and CWE-284. The selection of CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately represents the **incorrect** authorization check, rather than a complete lack of authorization (which would be CWE-862) or a general access control issue (CWE-284).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
