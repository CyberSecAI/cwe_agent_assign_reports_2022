The relationship analysis shows that CWE-94 is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) and CWE-913 (Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources). CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, is included as a secondary CWE since the attacker needs to have \"certain authorized users\" to inject malicious code.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect authorization**, where an attacker has the right access to create source rules. Then, the attacker can inject malicious code in the source rules which leads to **improper control of generation of code** and finally results in remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **remote code execution** impact, suggesting a code injection vulnerability. The key phrase \"inject malicious code in the source rules\" is strong evidence for **CWE-94 [Improper Control of Generation of Code]**. This CWE describes a scenario where externally-influenced input is used to construct a code segment without proper neutralization, which directly aligns with the vulnerability description. The description states that \"an attacker with this authorization can inject malicious code in the source rules and perform remote code execution,\" further supporting this mapping.\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-94 as the top candidate. Although the usage is \"Allowed-with-Review\" because it's frequently misused for vulnerabilities with a technical impact of \"code execution,\" the description explicitly mentions injecting malicious code, making it a valid match.\n\nI considered **CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization]** because the vulnerability description mentions that the attacker is an \"authorized user.\" However, the primary issue is the code injection, not the authorization itself. So I added it as a secondary CWE because it is part of the exploit, but not the root cause.\n\nThe selection of CWE-94 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the weakness of **improperly controlling the generation of code** due to injected malicious code, leading to remote code execution.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
