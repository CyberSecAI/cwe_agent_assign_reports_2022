CWE-532, while also related to information exposure, is mapped as a secondary weakness since the initial exposure happens via error messages and then propagates to logs. The abstraction levels were considered, favoring the base level for CWE-209 and CWE-532.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe209 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe209 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe532\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe209 primary\n    class cwe532 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a user providing invalid input while editing a `Secret` resource in the Argo CD UI. This leads to the generation of an error message containing the entire contents of the `Secret` (CWE-209). The error message is then logged (CWE-532), further increasing the risk of exposure and causing **Exposure of System Data to an Unauthorized Control Sphere** (CWE-200).\n  - Root Cause: Incorrect error handling leading to sensitive data in error messages (CWE-209).\n  - Weakness Propagation: Sensitive data being logged (CWE-532).\n  - Impact: **Exposure of System Data to an Unauthorized Control Sphere** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the vulnerability description points towards a general **Exposure of System Data to an Unauthorized Control Sphere**. However, the CVE Reference Links Content Summary reveals that the root cause is specifically the improper generation of error messages containing sensitive information (secrets) when a user provides invalid input to a secret resource. This sensitive information is then logged.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) as the top candidate, supported by a high sparse score. The description of CWE-209 aligns well with the vulnerability details: \"The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\" This directly reflects the scenario where Argo CD generates an error message containing the contents of the `Secret` resource.\n\nCWE-532 is also selected as the error message is logged into a log file which then increases the exposure of sensitive data.\n\nCWE-200 is considered but is too general as it describes a broad class of information exposure issues. The more specific CWE-209 and CWE-532 are more appropriate given the provided evidence.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary that clearly indicates the **rootcause** is the improper handling of error messages and logging of secrets. The hierarchical relationships, particularly the ChildOf relationship between CWE-209 and CWE-200, and between CWE-532 and CWE-200, reinforces the selection of the more specific CWE-209 and CWE-532 to accurately represent the vulnerability.\nThe selection of CWE-209 and CWE-532 offers a more precise and actionable classification of the vulnerability, focusing on the specific coding error that leads to the information exposure.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-335: Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) but does not correctly manage seeds.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: Irrelevant to the vulnerability description.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
