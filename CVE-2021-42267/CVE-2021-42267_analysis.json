CWE-788 **Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer** is also a child of CWE-119. These relationships indicate that the vulnerability involves writing data outside the intended buffer, potentially leading to memory corruption and arbitrary code execution. CWE-123 **Write-what-where Condition** is a more general case of out-of-bounds write where an attacker can write arbitrary data to arbitrary locations in memory.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe788[\"CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe788 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe123 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe788,cwe123 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insecure handling** of a malicious FLA file leading to **memory corruption** due to an out-of-bounds write. This results in the ability to achieve arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed towards CWE-119 based on similar CVE descriptions. However, further analysis of the vulnerability description and the retriever results, specifically the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, indicates that the root cause is more precisely described as an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787). The vulnerability description mentions \"memory corruption\" due to \"insecure handling\" of a malicious FLA file, which directly leads to writing outside the intended buffer.\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports this, stating the root cause is \"Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer (CWE-788)\" and \"Out-of-bounds read/write leading to memory corruption.\" While CWE-788 is a candidate, its mapping guidance is discouraged, suggesting looking into children such as CWE-787.\n\nCWE-787 is a base-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The \"alternate_terms\" for CWE-787 include \"Memory Corruption\", which aligns with the vulnerability description.\n\nTherefore, the final decision is to classify this vulnerability as CWE-787 **Out-of-bounds Write**. This is supported by the evidence and aligns with the mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available.
