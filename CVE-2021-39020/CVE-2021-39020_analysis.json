CWE-209 and CWE-532 are related in that they also involve exposure of sensitive information, but in different contexts (error messages and log files, respectively). The choice of CWE-598 is based on the specific detail of using GET requests, making it a more precise match than its parent, CWE-201.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe598[\"CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe598 -->|CHILDOF| cwe201\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe209\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe532\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe598 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe209,cwe532,cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper storage of sensitive information** in URL parameters, leading to the exposure of this information through server logs, referrer headers, or browser history. This constitutes an information disclosure vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-598 as the primary candidate based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions storing sensitive information in URL parameters, a characteristic feature of GET requests. The retriever results also ranked CWE-598 as the top combined result, further reinforcing this selection.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and CVE reference links, which highlight the root cause as storing sensitive information in URL parameters. This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-598. The relationship analysis confirms that choosing CWE-598, a variant, is more specific and accurate than its parent CWE-201.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
