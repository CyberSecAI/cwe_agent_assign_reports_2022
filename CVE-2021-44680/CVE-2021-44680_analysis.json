There are no direct parent-child or chain relationships significantly influencing the selection in this case. The relationship with CWE-915 (Object Injection) was noted in the Complete CWE Specifications and might be important in other contexts.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n    cwe915[\"CWE-915: Improper Neutralization of \u043e\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0445\u0430\"]\n\n    cwe502 -->|ChildOf| cwe913\n    cwe502 -->|PeerOf| cwe915\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe502 primary\n    class cwe913,cwe915 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the service listening on a TCP port. This service **deserializes untrusted data** (CWE-502), leading to potential remote code execution. The lack of proper input validation allows attackers to inject malicious payloads, leading to full system compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary, both of which explicitly mention **deserialization of untrusted data** as the root cause. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" also highlights the **weakness** as **deserialization**.\n\n> **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**\n> -   **weakness:** **deserialization**\n\n> **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:**\n> **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Deserialization of untrusted data within the `EVMonitoring.exe` component of Veritas Enterprise Vault.\n\nBased on this evidence, CWE-502 is the most appropriate and specific classification. The Retriever Results also list CWE-502 as the top match, further reinforcing this decision.\n\nThe analysis considered other CWEs from the Retriever Results, such as CWE-923 (Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints), CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), and CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption). However, these were deemed less relevant as they address related but distinct aspects of the vulnerability. CWE-923 is about communication channel restriction, CWE-306 about authentication, and CWE-400 about resource consumption. The core issue is the **deserialization of untrusted data** and not the communication channel, authentication or resource consumption directly.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity as it is a Base-level CWE that directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
