The secondary CWE is CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), a Base-level CWE and a ChildOf CWE-863. The selection of CWE-863 acknowledges that an authorization check was performed, but it was done incorrectly. The selection of CWE-639 acknowledges that a user-controlled key was used to bypass authorization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  The system uses a client certificate for authentication.\n2.  An authorization check is performed during enrollment, but not during revocation.\n3.  Due to the **missing** authorization check during revocation, a user can **revoke a certificate belonging to another tenant**.\n\nThe root cause is the **incorrect** authorization (CWE-863) or more specifically the **missing** authorization check in the revocation process. The impact is the ability to **revoke a certificate belonging to another tenant**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which indicates that there is an authorization issue. Specifically, the vulnerability description states that the \"check was not performed when authenticating revocation operations, allowing a known tenant to revoke a certificate belonging to another tenant.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is based on the fact that an authorization check was performed during enrollment but not during revocation. This means that the authorization process was **incorrect**, leading to the vulnerability. While CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) could be considered, CWE-863 is more appropriate because an authorization mechanism *exists* and *is used*, but it **fails** to properly enforce multi-tenancy constraints during revocation. CWE-639 describes an authorization bypass through a user-controlled key, which is relevant because the client certificate acts as a key that is used for authentication. The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the weakness and provide enough information for remediation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
