CWE-614 is a more specific Variant of CWE-319, indicating a particular scenario where sensitive cookies are transmitted in cleartext due to the missing 'Secure' attribute in an HTTPS session. While CWE-319 is appropriate, the additional context provided by CWE-614 makes it a relevant secondary consideration.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n\n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe614 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**, which leads to a risk of **cleartext transmission of sensitive information**. This **cleartext transmission**, if exploited using man-in-the-middle techniques, allows a remote attacker to **obtain sensitive information**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **root cause**, which is the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**. This directly leads to the potential for transmitting sensitive information in cleartext. The vulnerability description clearly states that this **failure** can be exploited by a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to **obtain sensitive information**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-319 is based on the vulnerability description indicating a **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**, resulting in the possibility of sensitive information being transmitted in cleartext. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section reinforces this by highlighting \"**failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**\" as the **rootcause**.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision by highlighting that CWE-614 is a child of CWE-319, indicating a more specific scenario. While CWE-319 is the primary CWE due to the general **cleartext transmission**, CWE-614 provides valuable additional context related to cookies and the 'Secure' attribute in HTTPS sessions.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an optimal level of specificity. CWE-319 accurately captures the essence of the vulnerability, while CWE-614 adds a relevant detail without being overly specific or losing the core issue. The evidence supports both CWEs, and the relationship between them enhances the overall understanding of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE is not related to the described vulnerability, which centers on the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security** rather than the use of weak credentials.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* The vulnerability doesn't involve an incorrect implementation of an authentication algorithm, but rather a **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Selected:* The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the risk of sensitive information being obtained due to the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**, making this CWE highly relevant.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE does not fit the vulnerability, as the issue is the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security** rather than a reliance on untrusted inputs.\n\n## CWE-1240: Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nTo fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* The vulnerability is related to HSTS, not the use of a cryptographic primitive.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
