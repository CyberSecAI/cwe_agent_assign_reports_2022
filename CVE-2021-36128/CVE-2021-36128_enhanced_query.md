# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-36128

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in the CentralAuth extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. Autoblocks for CentralAuth-issued suppression blocks are not properly implemented.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **product:** MediaWiki
- **version:** through 1.36
- **component:** CentralAuth extension

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in how MediaWiki's `ActorStore` handles database connections when suppressing users via the `Special:CentralAuth` page. Specifically, when a user is suppressed across multiple wikis, the `ActorStore::checkDatabaseDomain` function was not properly verifying if the database connection domain matches the expected one. This issue arose because cross-wiki blocks were being handled without proper awareness of the target wiki, leading to operations being performed in the context of the wrong wiki.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Database Context:** The code was not properly ensuring that database operations, particularly those related to user blocks and suppressions, were executed within the correct wiki's database context. This is due to the `ActorStore` not properly checking if the database connection domain matches the expected wiki.
*   **Cross-wiki Blocking Issues:**  The implementation of cross-wiki blocking was flawed, causing autoblocks to be created in the context of the wrong wiki (usually metawiki), which resulted in errors.
*   **CentralAuth Specific:** This issue primarily affected scenarios where CentralAuth was used for cross-wiki user management, particularly for user suppression.
*   **Autoblock Logic:** The logic for autoblocks was not "wiki-aware", meaning that when a user was blocked across wikis, the associated autoblocks were being created on the wrong wiki.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Suppression Failure:** The primary impact was that global suppressions (hiding a user's identity across all wikis) issued through `Special:CentralAuth` would fail with an `InvalidArgumentException`. This prevented administrators from effectively hiding or locking user accounts across the wiki farm.
*   **Incorrect Autoblocks:**  Autoblocks were being created in the wrong wiki, which could lead to unexpected behavior and block users on wikis where they haven't committed violations, or fail to apply the blocks to the wiki where the violation occurred.
*   **Operational Disruption:**  The inability to properly suppress accounts could lead to operational disruptions, especially in cases where a user needs to be quickly hidden due to privacy or security reasons.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability was triggered when administrators used the `Special:CentralAuth` page to suppress users globally, particularly when cross-wiki blocking was involved.
*   The specific actions were related to the `CentralAuthUser::doLocalSuppression` method, which was not correctly handling database connections during suppression.
*   The `CheckUser` extension contributed to the problem through its retroactive autoblocking functionality, which was not wiki-aware.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Access:** The "attacker" in this case was primarily an administrator or a user with sufficient rights to use the `Special:CentralAuth` interface and perform user suppression.
*   **Cross-wiki Context:** The issue was primarily triggered during cross-wiki operations, meaning the user attempting suppression would need to have the necessary permissions to perform actions across multiple wikis.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information is more detailed than a typical CVE description as it includes the stack trace, code snippets, and the context of the problem within the MediaWiki environment.
*   The resolution involved a combination of disabling autoblocks for CentralAuth-issued suppressions as a temporary workaround, and subsequently implementing proper cross-wiki awareness in the blocking mechanisms.
*   The fix involved modifications to several parts of the MediaWiki code, including `ActorStore`, `DatabaseBlockStore`, `CentralAuthUser`, and the `CheckUser` extension.
*   The provided information also describes how patches were backported to different MediaWiki releases and branches.

**Abstraction:** Compound
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

### Extended Description
When a web server is designed to receive a request from a client without any mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it might be possible for an attacker to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.
**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine if other weaknesses allow CSRF attacks to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable CSRF tokens might allow bypass of CSRF protection mechanisms; if this occurs, they might be better characterized as randomness/predictability weaknesses.
**Reasons:**
- Other


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

There can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.


**[Theoretical]** 

The CSRF topology is multi-channel:


  - Attacker (as outsider) to intermediary (as user). The interaction point is either an external or internal channel.

  - Intermediary (as user) to server (as victim). The activation point is an internal channel.





### Observed Examples

- **CVE-2004-1995:** Add user accounts via a URL in an img tag
- **CVE-2004-1967:** Arbitrary code execution by specifying the code in a crafted img tag or URL




## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

### Extended Description


Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:


  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.

  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.

  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.

  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.

  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.

  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.

There are three main kinds of XSS:

  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.

  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. 

  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. 

Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as "drive-by hacking."

In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.


### Alternative Terms
XSS: A common abbreviation for Cross-Site Scripting.
HTML Injection: Used as a synonym of stored (Type 2) XSS.
CSS: In the early years after initial discovery of XSS, "CSS" was a commonly-used acronym. However, this would cause confusion with "Cascading Style Sheets," so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.

## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

### Extended Description


Attackers at the destination may be able to spoof trusted servers to steal data or cause a denial of service.


There are at least two distinct weaknesses that can cause the product to communicate with an unintended destination:


  - If the product allows an attacker to control which destination is specified, then the attacker can cause it to connect to an untrusted or malicious destination. For example, because UDP is a connectionless protocol, UDP packets can be spoofed by specifying a false source address in the packet; when the server receives the packet and sends a reply, it will specify a destination by using the source of the incoming packet - i.e., the false source. The server can then be tricked into sending traffic to the wrong host, which is effective for hiding the real source of an attack and for conducting a distributed denial of service (DDoS). As another example, server-side request forgery (SSRF) and XML External Entity (XXE) can be used to trick a server into making outgoing requests to hosts that cannot be directly accessed by the attacker due to firewall restrictions.

  - If the product incorrectly specifies the destination, then an attacker who can control this destination might be able to spoof trusted servers. While the most common occurrence is likely due to misconfiguration by an administrator, this can be resultant from other weaknesses. For example, the product might incorrectly parse an e-mail or IP address and send sensitive data to an unintended destination. As another example, an Android application may use a "sticky broadcast" to communicate with a receiver for a particular application, but since sticky broadcasts can be processed by *any* receiver, this can allow a malicious application to access restricted data that was only intended for a different application.
