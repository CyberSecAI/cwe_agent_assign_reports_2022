This is a Class-level CWE. The secondary CWE is CWE-941, Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel, a Base-level CWE which could be related because the **incorrect** wiki is used.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe941[\"CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe941 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe **incorrect database context** due to the `ActorStore` not properly checking if the database connection domain matches the expected wiki (CWE-941) leads to **incorrect authorization** checks (CWE-863) when suppressing users via the `Special:CentralAuth` page in MediaWiki. This leads to suppression failures and incorrect autoblocks being created on the wrong wiki.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the evidence provided in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section of the vulnerability description.\n\nThe root cause of the vulnerability is that the `ActorStore::checkDatabaseDomain` function was not properly verifying if the database connection domain matches the expected one. This lead to operations being performed in the context of the wrong wiki, resulting in **incorrect authorization**.\n\nThe primary weakness is CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, because the application is not correctly performing the authorization check. The evidence for this is that global suppressions would fail and autoblocks were being created in the wrong wiki.\n\nThe secondary weakness is CWE-941, Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel, because the destination of the database operations was **incorrectly specified**. The evidence for this is that cross-wiki blocks were being handled without proper awareness of the target wiki, leading to operations being performed in the context of the wrong wiki.\n\nBoth CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-863 is a Class-level CWE, and CWE-941 is a Base-level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected*: Not relevant because this vulnerability is about **incorrect authorization** not interaction frequency.\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Selected as Secondary*: This CWE is related as the **incorrect** wiki database is used.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
