This is often caused by an **Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size (CWE-131)**. The hierarchical relationship is that CWE-787 is a consequence of CWE-131.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe131 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe131 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper check to return error when user application requests memory allocation of a huge size**. This leads to the potential for an **incorrect buffer size calculation**, which ultimately results in a **memory corruption** due to an **out-of-bounds write**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which indicates an **improper check to return error when user application requests memory allocation of a huge size** leading to **memory corruption**. The key phrase identifies the root cause as an **improper check** and the weakness as **memory corruption**.\n\nThe retriever results highlight **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** as the top candidate with a score of 1.000 and the alternate term \"Memory Corruption\" which is mentioned in the vulnerability description. This aligns with the vulnerability description of writing data outside the intended buffer.\n\n**CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size)** is considered as a secondary CWE. The description indicates that the product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow. While the description mentions \"huge size\", it also suggests an issue in handling memory allocation requests. This is considered a reasonable but less direct mapping, hence the lower confidence.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-787** is at the base level, which is the optimal level of specificity based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.83\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nMemory Corruption: Often used to describe the consequences of writing to memory outside the bounds of a buffer, or to memory that is otherwise invalid.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.
