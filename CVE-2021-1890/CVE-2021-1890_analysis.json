CWE-787 represents the potential impact of the **improper validation** leading to an out-of-bounds write and memory corruption. The relationship between CWE-1285 and CWE-787 is not directly defined in the provided relationships, but the failure to validate an input can lead to out-of-bounds writes. CWE-1285 is a child of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), which is a broad category.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1285[\"CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe1285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe1285 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1285 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with the **improper length check of the public exponent** (CWE-1285), which leads to memory corruption (CWE-787).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which indicates an **improper length check** as the root cause, resulting in memory corruption.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"**Improper length check of public exponent** in RSA import key function could cause memory corruption.\"\n\nCWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input) is the primary candidate because it directly addresses the **improper validation** aspect. The description for CWE-1285 states: \"The product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.\" This aligns with the **improper length check of public exponent**.\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a secondary candidate as it describes the impact (memory corruption).\n\nThe selection is based on identifying the root cause (improper validation) and then considering the impact (memory corruption). The evidence supports CWE-1285 as the primary weakness due to the direct reference to **improper length check**. The abstraction level of Base is appropriate as it represents the specific weakness.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read): While memory corruption is a potential impact, the root cause is the **improper length check**, not necessarily a read beyond the buffer.\n*   CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference) and CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset): These are related to pointer issues, which are not explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-415 (Double Free): This is a memory management issue not directly related to the **improper length check**.\n*   CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition): This is related to race conditions, which are not indicated in the description.\n*   CWE-781 (Improper Address Validation in IOCTL with METHOD_NEITHER I/O Control Code): This is specific to IOCTL, which is not mentioned in the description.\n*   CWE-124 (Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')): This is not the primary impact.\n\n---\n# Summary\n| CWE ID  | CWE Name                                                                | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| CWE-1285 | Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input | 0.8        | Base                  | Allowed                         | Primary CWE                   |\n| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write                                                     | 0.7        | Base                  | Allowed                         | Secondary Candidate             |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE, CWE-1285, represents the **improper validation** aspect, which is the root cause.
