Given the direct mention of \"**Improper Exception Handling**\" in the vulnerability description key phrases, selecting CWE-755 provides a more precise classification than its parent.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe755[\"CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe703[\"CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    \n    cwe755 -->|CHILDOF| cwe703\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe755 primary\n    class cwe703 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with \"**Improper Exception Handling**\" which leads to preventing the system from booting.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-755 as the most relevant CWE due to the explicit mention of \"**Improper Exception Handling**\" in the vulnerability description. The vulnerability description clearly states that a local attacker with physical access can exploit this vulnerability to prevent the system from booting.\n\nThe evidence for selecting CWE-755 is primarily based on the \"**Improper Exception Handling**\" phrase found in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section. The retriever results also list CWE-755 as the top candidate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-755 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the type of weakness described in the vulnerability, which is the **improper handling of exceptions**. While more specific CWEs might exist for particular types of exception handling errors, the available information does not provide sufficient detail to warrant a more granular classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-703\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
