## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-78, which is a base-level CWE and a child of the class-level CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). CWE-78 focuses specifically on OS command injection, which aligns with the vulnerability description. CWE-20, while present in the retriever results, is too general. The relationship between CWE-20 and CWE-78 is that improper input validation (CWE-20) can lead to OS command injection (CWE-78) if the input is used to construct an OS command.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper input validation**, leading to the ability to **execute arbitrary command** through crafted input values.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-78 as the primary candidate due to the ability to execute arbitrary commands. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-78. CWE-20 was also considered but deemed too general. The decision is based on the vulnerability description stating that the attacker can "execute arbitrary command," indicating OS command injection.

The evidence is strong, as indicated by the vulnerability description key phrases: "**rootcause:** **improper input validation**" and "**impact:** execute arbitrary command." The graph relationships support the selection of CWE-78 as the primary weakness, with CWE-20 as a potential contributing factor.

The selection of CWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the vulnerability's root cause and impact.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 9367.56
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE
