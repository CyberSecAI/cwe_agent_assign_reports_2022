## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect implementation of the `Send` trait** for the `Bucket2` type, allowing non-`Send` types to be moved between threads. This leads to a **race condition (CWE-366)** where multiple threads access and modify shared resources concurrently without proper synchronization, potentially resulting in data races and memory corruption.
  - **Root Cause:** Incorrect `Send` implementation
  - **Weakness:** Race Condition (CWE-366)
  - **Impact:** Data Races, Memory Corruption

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which highlight the **incorrect implementation of the `Send` trait** for the `Bucket2` type in the `syncpool` crate. This allows non-`Send` types to be moved between threads, leading to potential data races and memory corruption.

The selection of CWE-366 (Race Condition within a Thread) as the primary CWE is justified by the evidence that the vulnerability involves concurrent execution of shared resources within a thread without proper synchronization. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions "data races" as a consequence of the vulnerability.

CWE-821 (Incorrect Synchronization) was considered as a secondary candidate because the vulnerability involves **improper synchronization** of access to shared resources. However, CWE-366 is more specific in that it focuses on race conditions within a thread, which aligns more closely with the vulnerability description.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the **root cause** and the immediate consequence of the vulnerability. More general CWEs, such as CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization), would not capture the specific context of the vulnerability being within a thread.

The selection of CWE-366 is further supported by the Retriever Results, which identifies it as the top candidate with a **Base** abstraction level. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-366 allows its usage, further reinforcing its suitability.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2020-36462

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in the syncpool crate before 0.1.6 for Rust. There is an unconditional implementation of Send for Bucket2.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** unconditional implementation of Send for Bucket2
- **product:** syncpool crate
- **version:** before 0.1.6

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `syncpool` crate's `Bucket2` type incorrectly implemented the `Send` trait without a necessary type bound. This allowed instances of `Bucket2` containing non-`Send` types to be moved between threads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unconditional `Send` implementation:** The `Bucket2` struct in affected versions of the `syncpool` crate incorrectly implemented the `Send` trait.
*   **Data Races:**  By allowing non-`Send` types (like `Cell<T>` or `Rc<T>`) to be moved between threads via `Bucket2`, the code introduces the potential for data races.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Data races resulting from the vulnerability can lead to memory corruption, as demonstrated in the proof-of-concept (PoC) from the original report issue.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The CVSS score indicates high impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely, as indicated by CVSS Attack Vector of Network (AV:N). However, this is likely more related to the fact that it is a library vulnerability that can be exploited within an application accessed via network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability (PR:N).
*   **No User Interaction:** Exploitation does not require any user interaction (UI:N).
*   **High Attack Complexity:** Exploitation requires a higher degree of complexity (AC:H).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the `syncpool` crate before version `0.1.6`.
*   The fix was implemented by adding a `T: Send` bound to the `Send` implementation of `Bucket2<T>`. This ensures that `Bucket2` can only be `Send` if the type it contains (`T`) is also `Send`.
* The vulnerability is tracked as RUSTSEC-2020-0142, CVE-2020-36462, GHSA-r88h-6987-g79f and GHSA-vp6r-mrq9-8f4h.

In summary, the vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of the `Send` trait in the `syncpool` crate, leading to potential data races and memory corruption.

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

### Extended Description


A race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.


A race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:


  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.

  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.

A race condition exists when an "interfering code sequence" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.

The interfering code sequence could be "trusted" or "untrusted." A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.


### Alternative Terms
Race Condition

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-691
CanPrecede -> CWE-416
CanPrecede -> CWE-476

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.

**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.

**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.

**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.




## CWE-758: Reliance on Undefined, Unspecified, or Implementation-Defined Behavior
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an API function, data structure, or other entity in a way that relies on properties that are not always guaranteed to hold for that entity.

### Extended Description
This can lead to resultant weaknesses when the required properties change, such as when the product is ported to a different platform or if an interaction error (CWE-435) occurs.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-710

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2006-1902:** Change in C compiler behavior causes resultant buffer overflows in programs that depend on behaviors that were undefined in the C standard.




## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Others could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
buffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
memory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-118
ChildOf -> CWE-20

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist




## CWE-821: Incorrect Synchronization
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product utilizes a shared resource in a concurrent manner, but it does not correctly synchronize access to the resource.

### Extended Description
If access to a shared resource is not correctly synchronized, then the resource may not be in a state that is expected by the product. This might lead to unexpected or insecure behaviors, especially if an attacker can influence the shared resource.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-662
ChildOf -> CWE-662

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.






## CWE-416: Use After Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** 

This is a broad category. Some examples include:


  - simple math errors,

  - incorrectly updating parallel counters,

  - not accounting for size differences when "transforming" one input to another format (e.g. URL canonicalization or other transformation that can generate a result that's larger than the original input, i.e. "expansion").

This level of detail is rarely available in public reports, so it is difficult to find good examples.

**[Maintenance]** 

This weakness may be a composite or a chain. It also may contain layering or perspective differences.


This issue may be associated with many different types of incorrect calculations (CWE-682), although the integer overflow (CWE-190) is probably the most prevalent. This can be primary to resource consumption problems (CWE-400), including uncontrolled memory allocation (CWE-789). However, its relationship with out-of-bounds buffer access (CWE-119) must also be considered.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2020-17087:** Chain: integer truncation (CWE-197) causes small buffer allocation (CWE-131) leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in kernel pool, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.
- **CVE-2004-1363:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using environment variables that are expanded after the length check is performed
- **CVE-2004-0747:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using expansion of environment variables




## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.

### Extended Description
Some regular expression engines have a feature called "backtracking". If the token cannot match, the engine "backtracks" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.
 Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:


  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.

  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.

  - The input can be long enough.

 Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. 

### Alternative Terms
ReDoS: ReDoS is an abbreviation of "Regular expression Denial of Service".
Regular Expression Denial of Service: While this term is attack-focused, this is commonly used to describe the weakness.
Catastrophic backtracking: This term is used to describe the behavior of the regular expression as a negative technical impact.
