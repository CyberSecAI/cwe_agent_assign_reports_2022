It has a parent-child relationship with CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) and a peer relationship with CWE-286 (Incorrect User Management). CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) were also considered due to their relevance to access control issues, but ultimately CWE-266 was deemed the most accurate representation of the **root cause**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe286[\"CWE-286: Incorrect User Management\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe266 -->|CHILDOF| cwe269\n    cwe266 --|CANALSOBE| cwe286\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe732,cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe269,cwe285,cwe284,cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect access control** (CWE-266) leading to a full container compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly states \"**incorrect access control**\" as the **root cause**. This aligns well with the definition of CWE-266, Incorrect Privilege Assignment, which describes a product incorrectly assigning a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\nThe changelog information in the CVE reference link summary does not provide more rootcause information.\n\nThe Retriever Results list CWE-732, Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, and CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, as potential candidates. While related to access control, they are less specific than CWE-266 in capturing the **incorrect assignment** aspect described in the vulnerability. CWE-266 is a Base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\nTherefore, based on the available evidence, CWE-266 is the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource - While related to access control, it focuses on incorrect permission assignment for resources, not specifically privilege assignment to actors. This is an allowed-with-review Class level CWE.\n*   CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization - This is a general class of authorization errors. The provided description is more specific, so a base CWE is better. This is an allowed-with-review Class level CWE.\n*   CWE-285: Improper Authorization - This is too high-level and discouraged for use.\n*   CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere - This is too high-level and discouraged for use.\n*   CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management - This is a class level CWE that is often misused, and is a parent of CWE-266.\n*   CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions - This is related to file permissions during installation, which doesn't match the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-386: Symbolic Name not Mapping to Correct Object - This CWE is not related to privilege or permission issues.",
