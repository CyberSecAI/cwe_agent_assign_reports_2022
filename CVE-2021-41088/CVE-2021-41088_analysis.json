It has parent relationships with CWE-345 and CWE-284, indicating broader categories of improper validation and access control issues. While a more specific base-level CWE might be ideal, the description focuses on the lack of origin checking, making CWE-346 the most accurate fit.\n\nCWE-20 **Improper Input Validation** is a very broad class level CWE and should be avoided, but is present because the origin is technically an input.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe346[\"CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe346 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe346 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe346\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe346 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper origin validation** (CWE-346), leading to the ability to send arbitrary code to the backend, and resulting in arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **lack of proper origin checking** in the Elvish web UI backend, which allows malicious websites to send arbitrary code to the localhost endpoint. This aligns with the description of CWE-346 **Origin Validation Error**, as it highlights the failure to properly verify the source of the data. The retriever results also list CWE-346 as the top match.\n\nThe vulnerability description key phrases state: \"**rootcause: Elvishs web UI backend does not check the origin of requests correctly**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also supports this: \"**Insufficient Origin Validation:** The web UI backend fails to properly validate the origin of requests, allowing cross-origin requests to the vulnerable endpoint.\"\n\nOther CWEs were considered but deemed less appropriate. CWE-201 **Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data**, CWE-116 **Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output**, and CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** did not directly address the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the failure to validate the origin of the request. CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation** is too general and discouraged by MITRE guidance when a more specific CWE is available.\n\nCWE-346 **Origin Validation Error** is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability, as it directly addresses the **root cause** of the issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
