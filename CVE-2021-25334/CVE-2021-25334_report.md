# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2021-25334

## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-20 (Primary) | Improper Input Validation | 0.75 | Class | Allowed | CWE-20 is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly states "**Improper input check**". |
| CWE-1285 (Secondary) | Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input | 0.60 | Base | Allowed | CWE-1285 is considered as a more specific alternative to CWE-20, but there is insufficient information to confirm if the improper input check is related to an index, position, or offset. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-1285 and CWE-20. CWE-1285 is a more specific type of input validation issue. However, due to lack of specific detail in the vulnerability description, the broader CWE-20 was chosen as the primary mapping.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper input check**, which leads to a permanent denial of service.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description explicitly states "**Improper input check**", making CWE-20 a strong candidate. The Retriever Results also listed CWE-20, but discourages its use when lower-level CWEs could be used.

The evidence is directly from the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" where the **rootcause** is listed as "**Improper input check**".

CWE-1285 was considered as a more specific alternative, but there was not enough evidence to confirm that the **improper input check** relates to an index, position, or offset. Therefore, CWE-20 was chosen as the primary mapping due to the direct mention of "**Improper input check**" in the vulnerability description. CWE-20 is at the Class level, while CWE-1285 is at the Base level, but choosing the broader CWE-20 is justified due to the lack of specifics.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Used:* This CWE focuses on access control granularity, which is not the primary issue described in the vulnerability. The vulnerability focuses on checking input, not on access control.

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.

*Not Used:* This CWE deals with insufficient privileges, while the vulnerability is about improper input checks.

## CWE-653: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Used:* This CWE focuses on improper isolation, which is not the primary issue described in the vulnerability. The vulnerability focuses on checking input, not on isolation.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Used:* Although the vulnerability involves an untrusted application, the core issue is about the **improper input check** itself, not the reliance on untrusted input in a security decision.

## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Used:* This CWE deals with insufficient permissions or privileges, while the vulnerability is about improper input checks.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Used:* This CWE deals with validating equivalence of input values, while the vulnerability is about a more general **improper input check**.

## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.

*Not Used:* This CWE is too general and does not directly relate to the **improper input check** described in the vulnerability.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Used:* This CWE focuses on authorization bypass, which is not the primary issue described in the vulnerability. The vulnerability focuses on checking input, not authorization.

## CWE-1263: Improper Physical Access Control
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is designed with access restricted to certain information, but it does not sufficiently protect against an unauthorized actor with physical access to these areas.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Used:* This CWE deals with physical access control, while the vulnerability is about improper input checks.

## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use
