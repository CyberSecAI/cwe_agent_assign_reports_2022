However, CWE-74 is a Class, and CWE-89 is a Base weakness, making CWE-89 the more specific and appropriate choice. There are no other relationships that appear to influence this.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events in this vulnerability is:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **SQL Injection** (**CWE-89**) due to improper neutralization of special elements in SQL commands.\n2.  **Impact:** An attacker can obtain and modify sensitive information in the underlying database.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which clearly states that the vulnerability is a **SQL injection** in the Aruba ClearPass Policy Manager.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"A remote authenticated SQL Injection vulnerabilitiy was discovered in Aruba ClearPass Policy Manager version(s) Prior to 6.9.5, 6.8.8-HF1, 6.7.14-HF1. A vulnerability in the web-based management interface API of ClearPass could allow an authenticated remote attacker to conduct **SQL injection** attacks against the ClearPass instance. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain and modify sensitive information in the underlying database.\"\n\nThe **CWE for similar CVE Descriptions** section also lists CWE-89 as the primary match and the top CWE.\nThe Retriever Results list CWE-89 as the top combined result with a score of 1.000.\n\nThe detailed CWE specifications for CWE-89 confirms that it is the correct CWE, as it describes the weakness as: \"The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.\"\n\nThe decision to select CWE-89 is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description, the **CWE for similar CVE Descriptions**, the Retriever Results, and the detailed CWE specifications for CWE-89.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') - This was considered because it is another type of injection, but the vulnerability is specifically SQL injection, not OS command injection.\n*   CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') - This was considered because it appeared in the Retriever Results but is not relevant to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-20: Improper Input Validation - While input validation issues often lead to injection vulnerabilities, CWE-20 is a broad class. Since the specific weakness is SQL injection, CWE-89 is more appropriate.\n*   CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data - Not relevant to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-287: Improper Authentication - Not relevant to the described vulnerability, which is SQL injection.\n*   CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path - Not relevant to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') - This was considered because it is another type of injection, but the vulnerability is specifically SQL injection.\n*   CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements - This is a class-level CWE, and CWE-89 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information - Not relevant to the described vulnerability.",
