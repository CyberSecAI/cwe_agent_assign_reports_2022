# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-757 | Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade') | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is that CWE-319 is a child of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data), indicating a more specific form of the general encryption issue. CWE-757 represents the algorithm downgrade aspect, which could lead to cleartext transmission. Also the relationship between CWE-757 and CWE-300 indicates that it is not always required that an entity redirects or interferes with the network. CWE-312 is also a child of CWE-311, but applies to storage and not transmission.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect** conditional check in KMail that ties TLS negotiation to the authentication requirement. This leads to the **failure** to enforce STARTTLS, resulting in **cleartext transmission** of sensitive email content.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified several potential CWEs based on the vulnerability description and retriever results. The primary concern is the **transmission of cleartext messages** due to a **flawed** STARTTLS implementation. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" explicitly states that "KMail would send emails in **cleartext**, regardless of whether the server supported STARTTLS." This direct evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) as the primary CWE. The relationship analysis further solidifies this choice, as CWE-319 is a more specific child of CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data).

CWE-757 (Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')) was also considered because the vulnerability involves KMail not enforcing the strongest encryption available (STARTTLS) when authentication is not required. However, it's more of a secondary factor, as the primary issue is the **lack of enforcement** rather than a deliberate downgrade.

CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) was considered, but the primary issue is with **transmission**, not storage, making it less relevant.

The selection of CWE-319 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the core issue of **cleartext transmission** resulting from the **incorrect** implementation of STARTTLS. This choice is supported by the evidence, relationship analysis, and MITRE mapping guidance.

# Enhanced Query for CVE-2021-38373

## Vulnerability Description
In KDE KMail 19.12.3 (aka 5.13.3), the SMTP STARTTLS option is not honored (and cleartext messages are sent) unless Server requires authentication is checked.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** cleartext messages are sent
- **product:** KDE KMail
- **version:** 19.12.3 (aka 5.13.3)
- **component:** SMTP STARTTLS option

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the context of the provided documents:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The core issue is that KMail's implementation of STARTTLS (for SMTP) was flawed. Specifically, it only attempted to initiate the STARTTLS upgrade if the "Server requires authentication" option was enabled in the user interface. If this option was not checked, KMail would send emails in cleartext, regardless of whether the server supported STARTTLS. The vulnerability stems from an incorrect conditional check that ties TLS negotiation to the authentication requirement.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Conditional STARTTLS Enforcement:** The primary weakness is that STARTTLS was not consistently enforced. The code made an incorrect assumption that TLS is only needed when authentication is required. This led to an exploitable scenario where users could inadvertently send emails without encryption.
*   **Lack of Consistent Security:** The application logic failed to ensure secure communication by not enforcing STARTTLS when the server does not require authentication. This exposed users to potential eavesdropping and credential theft if they weren't using the authentication option.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Email Content:** The most direct impact is the exposure of email content sent via SMTP. An attacker intercepting network traffic could read emails in cleartext.
*   **Credential Theft (Potentially):** While the described vulnerability primarily concerns the lack of encryption for mail content, it's related to a wider class of STARTTLS vulnerabilities which can be leveraged to steal authentication credentials. An attacker could use this in combination with other STARTTLS vulnerabilities to capture user credentials if they are not sent via a separate authenticated channel.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** The primary attack vector is a MitM attack. An attacker positioned between the KMail client and the mail server can intercept and read unencrypted email traffic.
*   **Passive Eavesdropping:** An attacker could passively monitor network traffic to intercept emails sent in cleartext.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the user and their email server. This typically involves being on the same network as the user or controlling a network device in the path of communication.
*   **No Specific Client Configuration:** The vulnerability is inherent in the KMail client's logic, so no specific configuration of the client is required by the attacker to trigger this vulnerability; it is triggered by the user not selecting "Server requires authentication".
*   **Server Support for STARTTLS:** The target SMTP server must support STARTTLS but must *not* require authentication for the user to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided bug report and the noSTARTTLS website provide context and motivation of this vulnerability within a bigger research about STARTTLS issues.
*   The bug report has a comment which states:  "The STARTTLS option of SMTP is ignored, when "Server requires authentication" is not checked. In this case kmail will send any mail in cleartext."
*   The vulnerability is specifically tied to Kmail's incorrect implementation of STARTTLS, in contrast to the general STARTTLS problems, for which a large number of email client and servers where found vulnerable as described in the `nostarttls.secvuln.info` website.
*   The vulnerability was present in KMail version 5.13.3 (and potentially earlier versions).
*   The provided information indicates that the vulnerability has been addressed in the `ksmtp` component with the merge of the described commits.

This information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, providing insights into the specific implementation flaw and its practical implications.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29519:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends sensitive information in plaintext, including passwords and session tokens.
- **CVE-2022-30312:** Building Controller uses a protocol that transmits authentication credentials in plaintext.
- **CVE-2022-31204:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sends password in plaintext.




## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

### Extended Description


Because the information is stored in cleartext (i.e., unencrypted), attackers could potentially read it. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.


When organizations adopt cloud services, it can be easier for attackers to access the data from anywhere on the Internet.


In some systems/environments such as cloud, the use of "double encryption" (at both the software and hardware layer) might be required, and the developer might be solely responsible for both layers, instead of shared responsibility with the administrator of the broader system/environment.

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Different people use "cleartext" and "plaintext" to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.
- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie
- **CVE-2009-1466:** password stored in cleartext in a file with insecure permissions




## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Denylist / Deny List: This is used by CWE and CAPEC instead of other commonly-used terms. Its counterpart is allowlist.
Blocklist / Block List: This is often used by security tools such as firewalls, email or web gateways, proxies, etc.
Blacklist / Black List: This term is frequently used, but usage has been declining as organizations have started to adopt other terms.

### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** 

Multiple interpretation errors can indirectly introduce inputs that should be disallowed. For example, a list of dangerous shell metacharacters might not include a metacharacter that only has meaning in one particular shell, not all of them; or a check for XSS manipulations might ignore an unusual construct that is supported by one web browser, but not others.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the "\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.
- **CVE-2008-2309:** product uses a denylist to identify potentially dangerous content, allowing attacker to bypass a warning
- **CVE-2005-2782:** PHP remote file inclusion in web application that filters "http" and "https" URLs, but not "ftp".




## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.

### Extended Description


The sensitive information may be valuable information on its own (such as a password), or it may be useful for launching other, more serious attacks. The error message may be created in different ways:


  - self-generated: the source code explicitly constructs the error message and delivers it

  - externally-generated: the external environment, such as a language interpreter, handles the error and constructs its own message, whose contents are not under direct control by the programmer

An attacker may use the contents of error messages to help launch another, more focused attack. For example, an attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) might yield the full pathname of the installed application. In turn, this could be used to select the proper number of ".." sequences to navigate to the targeted file. An attack using SQL injection (CWE-89) might not initially succeed, but an error message could reveal the malformed query, which would expose query logic and possibly even passwords or other sensitive information used within the query.

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2008-2049:** POP3 server reveals a password in an error message after multiple APOP commands are sent. Might be resultant from another weakness.
- **CVE-2007-5172:** Program reveals password in error message if attacker can trigger certain database errors.
- **CVE-2008-4638:** Composite: application running with high privileges (CWE-250) allows user to specify a restricted file to process, which generates a parsing error that leaks the contents of the file (CWE-209).




## CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
A protocol or its implementation supports interaction between multiple actors and allows those actors to negotiate which algorithm should be used as a protection mechanism such as encryption or authentication, but it does not select the strongest algorithm that is available to both parties.

### Extended Description
When a security mechanism can be forced to downgrade to use a less secure algorithm, this can make it easier for attackers to compromise the product by exploiting weaker algorithm. The victim might not be aware that the less secure algorithm is being used. For example, if an attacker can force a communications channel to use cleartext instead of strongly-encrypted data, then the attacker could read the channel by sniffing, instead of going through extra effort of trying to decrypt the data using brute force techniques.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-693

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** This is related to CWE-300, although not all downgrade attacks necessarily require an entity that redirects or interferes with the network. See examples.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2006-4302:** Attacker can select an older version of the software to exploit its vulnerabilities.
- **CVE-2006-4407:** Improper prioritization of encryption ciphers during negotiation leads to use of a weaker cipher.
- **CVE-2005-2969:** chain: SSL/TLS implementation disables a verification step (CWE-325) that enables a downgrade attack to a weaker protocol.




## CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses a default cryptographic key for potentially critical functionality.

### Extended Description
It is common practice for products to be designed to use default keys. The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise. However, if admins do not change the defaults, it is easier for attackers to bypass authentication quickly across multiple organizations.
