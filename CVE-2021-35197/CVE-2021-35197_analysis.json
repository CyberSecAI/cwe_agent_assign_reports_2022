CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is a class-level CWE and is related to the impact of the vulnerability, which is a potential denial of service. Choosing CWE-862 provides a more specific and accurate representation of the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **missing authorization** checks (CWE-862) for blocked users attempting to perform purge actions. This leads to the ability for blocked users to issue purges, potentially causing **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400) and resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **missing authorization** check that allows blocked users to perform unintended actions. The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that \"The core **weakness** is the **lack of proper authorization checks** for blocked users attempting to perform purge actions. The code did not explicitly prevent blocked users from triggering purges.\"\n\nThe analysis also considered the impact of the vulnerability, which is a potential denial of service due to uncontrolled resource consumption. While CWE-400 is a possible secondary CWE due to the impact, the primary focus remains on the root cause, which is the **missing authorization** (CWE-862).\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **missing authorization** check, which is the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
