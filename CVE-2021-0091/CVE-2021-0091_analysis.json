While it aligns with the vulnerability description, it is generally discouraged due to its broad nature. I considered more specific child CWEs. CWE-1220, Insufficient Granularity of Access Control, and CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, are related to access control and authorization, respectively, and offer more specificity. These were considered as secondary candidates.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe1220[\"CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe1220 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe1220,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper access control** (**rootcause**), leading to a potential escalation of privilege (**impact**). The **improper access control** allows an unauthenticated user with local access to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-284 as the primary candidate due to the explicit mention of \"**Improper access control**\" in the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. However, CWE-284 is a Pillar-level CWE, which is discouraged. The retriever results suggested more specific CWEs like CWE-1220 and CWE-863. While these offer better specificity, the evidence is insufficient to definitively select one over the other. Therefore, I've retained CWE-284 as the primary mapping, acknowledging its high-level nature, and noted CWE-1220 and CWE-863 as secondary candidates for further investigation.\n\nThe decision is based on the provided evidence, primarily the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The relationship analysis highlights the hierarchical structure of CWEs, guiding the selection of more specific candidates where possible.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.
