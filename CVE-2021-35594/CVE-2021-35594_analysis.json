It can precede CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset), and CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value). CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is considered a secondary candidate as it is a common consequence of CWE-129.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe129[\"CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe1285[\"CWE-1285: Insufficiently Protected Publicly Available API\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe823[\"CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe129 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe129 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1285\n    cwe129 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe129 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe823\n    cwe129 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe789\n    cwe119 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe129 primary\n    class cwe20,cwe1285,cwe119,cwe823,cwe789 secondary\n    class cwe787 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-129) which results in a write past the end of an array, leading to a potential out-of-bounds write (CWE-787), and finally code execution in the context of the service account.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the root cause of the vulnerability lies in the **improper validation of user-supplied data**, specifically how it relates to array indices within the Oracle MySQL Cluster. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"Root cause: Improper validation of user-supplied data within the processing of Data Node jobs in Oracle MySQL Cluster.\" and \"Weaknesses: The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an array.\"\n\nThe primary CWE match from the provided data is CWE-NVD-noinfo. However, this is not a true CWE, and more specific CWEs should be identified. The \"Top CWEs\" list includes CWE-129 (Improper Validation of Array Index) and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). The retriever results also list CWE-129 as the top result.\n\nCWE-129 is chosen as the primary CWE because the root cause is the lack of proper validation of the array index. The description of CWE-129 precisely matches this: \"The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\" The mapping guidance for CWE-129 indicates \"Usage: Allowed\" and \"Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\"\n\nCWE-787 is a potential consequence of CWE-129 and is listed as a secondary candidate.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but ultimately deemed less appropriate:\n\n*   CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) were considered since the vulnerability involves access control; however, the root cause is not a failure in authentication or authorization mechanisms, but the improper validation of input that leads to memory corruption.\n*   CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')) was considered, but the vulnerability is not related to SQL injection.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-129 being a Variant that directly addresses the **improper validation** issue and CWE-787 being a common result of that vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
