CWE-540 is a child of CWE-538 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory), indicating a more general case where sensitive information is placed in accessible files, but CWE-540 is a better fit because it explicitly mentions source code. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered, but it is a more general class and the description advises against its use when more specific CWEs apply.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe540[\"CWE-540: Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe540 -->|CHILDOF| cwe538\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe540 primary\n    class cwe538,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Inclusion of sensitive information in the source code** (CWE-540).\n2.  **Impact:** Attackers can read application data.\n\nThere are no missing links, as the description directly connects the **inclusion of sensitive information** to the ability of attackers to read application data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which both highlight the **inclusion of sensitive information in source code** as the root cause.\n\n> **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**\n> - **rootcause:** **inclusion of sensitive information in source code**\n>\n> **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**\n> - **Root cause of vulnerability**: **Inclusion of sensitive information in the source code** of QNAP switches running QSS.\n> - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive information present in the source code.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by confirming that CWE-540 is a specific case of a broader category (CWE-538), making it a more appropriate choice than the general CWE-200. The selection is at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-540 directly addresses the identified root cause, without requiring further abstraction or generalization.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
