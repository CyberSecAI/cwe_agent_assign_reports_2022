The description directly states \"missing support for integrity check of download URL or downloaded file hash\". |\n| CWE-494 | Download of Code Without Integrity Check | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. This CWE is more specific, referring to the download of code. |\n| CWE-345 | Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. A more general CWE that encompasses integrity check issues. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-353, which is a base-level CWE indicating a missing integrity check. CWE-494, Download of Code Without Integrity Check, is also relevant and more specific, as the vulnerability involves downloading and executing code. CWE-345 is a broader class encompassing insufficient data authenticity verification, of which integrity checks are a part.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe353[\"CWE-353: Missing Support for Integrity Check\"]\n    cwe494[\"CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    \n    cwe353 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe494 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe353 primary\n    class cwe494 secondary\n    class cwe345 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing integrity check** (CWE-353), leading to the possibility of downloading and executing arbitrary files. The root cause is the **lack of verification**, and the impact is **arbitrary file download and execution**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment and the retriever results both indicate the importance of integrity checks in this vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states the **missing support for integrity check**, which aligns perfectly with CWE-353. While CWE-494 is also relevant, CWE-353 more directly addresses the root cause, as the vulnerability stems from a **lack of integrity check** mechanism. CWE-345 is a more general Class-level CWE. Therefore, selecting CWE-353 provides the most accurate and specific classification. The confidence score is high because the description explicitly mentions the **missing integrity check**, directly corresponding to the definition of CWE-353.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
