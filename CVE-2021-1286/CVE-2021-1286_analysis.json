CWE-79 has parent-child relationships with CWE-87, CWE-86, CWE-85, CWE-84, and CWE-83. There is also a peer relationship with CWE-352. CWE-80 is a child (Variant) of CWE-79 and represents a more specific type of XSS related to improper neutralization of script-related HTML tags, but the description doesn't provide enough information to determine that this specific weakness is present. CWE-116 is a Class level CWE that might be more appropriate if the issue is related to encoding or escaping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe80[\"CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe80 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe80,cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the web-based management interface of Cisco DCNM not properly validating user-supplied input. This leads to the possibility of **cross-site scripting** (XSS) or a reflected file download (RFD) attack. The **weakness** is the insufficient validation, which allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the web page served to other users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-79 as the primary weakness, based on the vulnerability description and the provided \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\". The description explicitly mentions \"**cross-site scripting** (XSS) attack\", which aligns directly with CWE-79. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section indicates \"Insufficient validation of user-supplied input\" as the root cause, which further supports the XSS classification. The Retriever Results also list CWE-79 as the top candidate.\n\nThe analysis considered other CWEs such as CWE-80 (Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags) and CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output). However, the provided information doesn't offer enough detail to confirm whether the XSS specifically involves improper neutralization of HTML tags or encoding/escaping issues. Therefore, sticking with the broader CWE-79 is more appropriate.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-79 is based on the direct evidence of XSS vulnerability in the description and the root cause of insufficient input validation. CWE-79 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred. The mapping guidance for CWE-79 allows its usage, and the rationale supports the decision to map to the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
