CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is a high-level Class that encompasses the unintended exposure of endpoints. While more specific CWEs might exist, the provided information doesn't offer enough detail to pinpoint a more precise root cause. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) could also be relevant if the unintended exposure is due to an authorization **defect**, but that's not explicitly stated, making it a secondary consideration.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe668 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe668 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a misconfiguration leading to unintended exposure:\n  1. The root cause is the **incorrect** use of `@RequestMapping` annotations at the type level on Feign client interfaces.\n  2. This leads to the **unintended exposure** of server-side endpoints.\n  3. Attackers can then potentially trigger server-side actions by sending requests to these unintended endpoints.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The key phrases \"involuntarily exposing endpoints\" and \"unintended exposure of server-side endpoints\" strongly suggest CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states, \"The vulnerability arises from the use of type-level `@RequestMapping` annotations on Feign client interfaces. When such annotations are used, the methods on the interface can become unintentionally exposed as endpoints.\"\n\nThe graph relationships highlight that more specific authorization-related CWEs could be relevant, but the provided evidence doesn't fully support that, making CWE-668 the most appropriate choice, albeit at a higher level of abstraction.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at a Class level due to the limited evidence. While more specific Base or Variant CWEs are generally preferred, the information doesn't allow for a more precise classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
