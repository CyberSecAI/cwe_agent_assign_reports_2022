CWE-798 is a **Base** CWE and parent of CWE-321. Since the hardcoded value is specifically a cryptographic key, CWE-321 is a more precise mapping choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n    class cwe1391 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **ROOTCAUSE** of using a **hard-coded cryptographic key** (CWE-321) for the admin user and the **lack of a key** for the guest user, leading to **incorrect access control** and ultimately an **authentication bypass** that allows unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points towards **CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key)** as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description clearly states that the \"key for admin is hardcoded in the installation code\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this, stating: \"The secret key for the admin user is hardcoded in the database installation script.\" This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-321, which focuses on the risks associated with hard-coded cryptographic keys.\n\n**CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)** was considered as a broader category, but **CWE-321** is a more specific **Variant** that accurately captures the **WEAKNESS**. The \"Mapping Guidance\" for both CWE-321 and CWE-798 recommends using the most specific level of abstraction.\n\nOther CWEs like CWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials) and CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) were considered but deemed less relevant. While the hard-coded key is technically a weak credential, CWE-321 specifically addresses cryptographic keys. CWE-259 focuses on passwords, making it less suitable.\n\nThe final decision to prioritize CWE-321 is based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the guidance to choose the most specific CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
