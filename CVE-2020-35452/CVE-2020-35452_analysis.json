This means that CWE-121 is a more specific type of out-of-bounds write that occurs on the stack. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a \"**stack overflow**,\" making CWE-121 the most accurate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain consists of a specially crafted Digest nonce (input) leading to a **stack overflow**.\n  - Crafted Digest nonce -> **Stack Overflow**\n  - Root cause: specially crafted Digest nonce\n  - Impact: Stack overflow\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the provided CVE reference links content summary. The vulnerability description states that \"A specially crafted Digest nonce can cause a **stack overflow** in mod_auth_digest.\" The CVE reference links content summary confirms this, stating \"A specially crafted Digest nonce can cause a stack overflow in the `mod_auth_digest` module of the Apache HTTP Server.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-121 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the type of buffer overflow (stack-based) mentioned in the description. The term \"**stack overflow**\" in the vulnerability description directly corresponds to CWE-121.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nStack Overflow: \"Stack Overflow\" is often used to mean the same thing as stack-based buffer overflow, however it is also used on occasion to mean stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call. Due to the ambiguity of the term, use of stack overflow to describe either circumstance is discouraged.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-788\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Stack-based buffer overflows can instantiate in return address overwrites, stack pointer overwrites or frame pointer overwrites. They can also be considered function pointer overwrites, array indexer overwrites or write-what-where condition, etc.\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-35395:** Stack-based buffer overflows in SFK for wifi chipset used for IoT/embedded devices, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n\nCWE-787 was considered but not chosen as it is a more general case of out-of-bounds write. The description specifically mentions \"**stack overflow**\", so CWE-121 is a better, more specific fit.",
