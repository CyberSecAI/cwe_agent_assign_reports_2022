CWE-125 is a peer of CWE-787, representing a related but distinct out-of-bounds access. The selection of CWE-787 as primary is due to the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning an **out-of-bounds array access** that leads to a write, fitting the CWE-787 description more accurately than CWE-125. CWE-119 is too general and discouraged.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe125 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves an **out-of-bounds array access** (CWE-787 or CWE-125) in the `nvlddmkm.sys` handler for `DxgkDdiEscape`. This leads to denial of service or information disclosure. The root cause is the improper handling of array indices or offsets within the driver.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **out-of-bounds array access** as the primary weakness. The retriever results suggested CWE-787, CWE-125, and CWE-119 as potential candidates. After reviewing the vulnerability description and the CWE specifications, CWE-787 was selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions an **out-of-bounds array access** that leads to a write. CWE-125 was considered as a secondary candidate because the vulnerability description also mentions information disclosure which is a symptom of reading sensitive information. CWE-119 was considered but is discouraged due to its generality.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision is derived directly from the vulnerability description key phrases: \"**rootcause: out of bounds array access**\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary which states: \"It involves an out-of-bounds array access.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-787 and CWE-119, reinforcing the need for a more specific classification than CWE-119.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-787 directly addresses the **out-of-bounds write** condition described in the vulnerability, while CWE-125 addresses the potential for information disclosure.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive -
