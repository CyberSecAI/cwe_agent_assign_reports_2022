The retriever results also included related CWEs such as CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing) and CWE-302 (Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data). However, based on the provided description, the best fit is CWE-287 as the **calling of a non-existent provider** suggests a fundamental **failure to properly authenticate** the provider being called. CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) were suggested alternatives.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe287 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events begins with the **calling of a non-existent provider**, which leads to **improper authentication**, and ultimately results in the ability to perform **unauthorized actions**, including a **denial of service attack**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **weakness** of **calling a non-existent provider** and its impact, which is a denial-of-service attack. The primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions was CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). The retriever results also suggested CWE-287 as a strong candidate.\n\nThe vulnerability description states \"**Calling of non-existent provider** in SMP sdk prior to version 3.0.9 allows unauthorized actions including denial of service attack by hijacking the provider.\"\n\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a Class-level CWE. Although the guidance discourages using class-level CWEs, in this case, it fits the description because the root cause is related to authentication. While more specific CWEs like CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) or CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) could potentially be considered, the information provided doesn't give enough detail to narrow it down further.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nWhen an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nauthentification: An alternate term is \"authentification\", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.\nAuthN: \"AuthN\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authentication\" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from \"AuthZ,\" which is an abbreviation of \"authorization.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\nAuthC: \"AuthC\" is used as an abbreviation of \"authentication,\" but it appears to used less frequently than \"AuthN.\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable.
