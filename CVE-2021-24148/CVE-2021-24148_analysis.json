The retriever results suggest more specific children like CWE-1390 Weak Authentication and CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function. CWE-1390 is a child of CWE-287, providing a more specific classification of the **authentication bypass**. CWE-306, while also a child of CWE-287, represents a scenario where authentication is completely missing, which is not the case here as the plugin attempts authentication but fails to do so correctly.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe1390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe1390,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper implementation of the \"Sign In With Apple\" authentication**, leading to an **authentication bypass**, which then allows **unauthenticated users to recover an authentication cookie**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **authentication bypass** as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an **\"authentication bypass\"** in the MStore API WordPress plugin. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this with the statement, \"The plugin had an authentication bypass vulnerability with Sign In With Apple.\"\n\nThe retriever results suggested several candidate CWEs, including CWE-1390 Weak Authentication, CWE-287 Improper Authentication, and CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function.\n\nCWE-287 is chosen as the primary CWE because it broadly covers the **improper authentication** issue. However, since the vulnerability involves a specific **weakness** in the authentication mechanism (Sign In With Apple), CWE-1390 Weak Authentication is also considered as a secondary CWE, as it provides a more specific categorization. CWE-306 is considered but not used as the **authentication bypass** occurs due to a **weakness** rather than a complete absence of authentication.\n\nThe selection of CWE-287 and CWE-1390 is based on the evidence provided and the relationships between the CWEs. CWE-287 is at a higher level, while CWE-1390 provides more specific details about the nature of the **weak authentication**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following

abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**:

claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate

vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 4748.89\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 4689.98",
