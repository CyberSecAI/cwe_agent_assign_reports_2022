The application uses `allowFunctions` to restrict the use of certain functions.\n2.  The application fails to properly neutralize escape, meta, or control sequences.\n3.  An attacker adds control characters (x00-x08) after the function name.\n4.  The control characters bypass the restrictions set by `allowFunctions`.\n5.  The attacker can execute arbitrary PHP functions, leading to potential remote code execution, data compromise, and denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability lies in the **improper neutralization** of control characters within function names, allowing attackers to bypass intended restrictions. The primary weakness is CWE-150.\n\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, especially from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which states: \"The template engine did not properly sanitize function names, allowing control characters to bypass restrictions set by `allowFunctions`.\"\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"There is a way to **bypass allowFunctions** that will affect the security of the application. When the template is set to allow/disallow the use of certain functions, adding control characters (x00-x08) after the function will **bypass these restrictions**.\" This clearly indicates a failure in neutralizing special elements (control characters) that leads to **incorrect authorization**.\n\nCWE-150 is selected because it directly addresses the root cause: **improper neutralization** of control sequences. It is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.\n\nCWE-863 is a secondary candidate, because the **bypass** of the `allowFunctions` mechanism results in **incorrect authorization**.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-78, CWE-88, CWE-94, CWE-95, CWE-99, CWE-116, CWE-138, CWE-178, CWE-184, CWE-425, CWE-471, CWE-770, CWE-908, CWE-915, CWE-917, CWE-1289, CWE-1321 and CWE-1333: These CWEs are related to different types of injection, resource handling, or input validation issues.
