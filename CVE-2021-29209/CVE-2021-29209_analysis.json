The description mentions \"dom xss,\" which falls under the broader category of XSS. CWE-93, a base-level CWE, is associated with CRLF Injection, which is the second vulnerability mentioned in the description. CWE-79 can be related to CWE-113 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')) through a CanPrecede relationship, as improper neutralization in web page generation might involve CRLF sequences. However, since the description directly mentions CRLF injection, CWE-93 is a more direct fit. The relationships help understand how XSS and CRLF injection can occur in web applications.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    \n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    cwe113 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe93 secondary\n    class cwe113 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the following steps:\n  1. The application **fails to properly neutralize** input.\n  2.  Malicious input leads to **DOM-based XSS (CWE-79)** in the web page and **CRLF injection (CWE-93)**.\n  3. The XSS can execute arbitrary scripts in the user's browser. The CRLF injection can manipulate HTTP headers.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states the presence of \"dom xss, crlf injection\" in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 and 5. The primary weakness is CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')), as the description mentions \"dom xss\". The secondary weakness is CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')), which directly corresponds to the \"crlf injection\" mentioned.\n\nThe \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section also lists CWE-79 as the primary match.\n\nThe retriever results also rank CWE-79 with a high similarity score. The evidence strongly supports mapping to both CWE-79 and CWE-93 because they are explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n\nThe graph relationships show how these weaknesses can be related, with CWE-113 being a child of CWE-93 and having a CanPrecede relationship with CWE-79, indicating potential connections between CRLF injection and XSS vulnerabilities.\n\nThe final selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they directly represent the described weaknesses (XSS and CRLF injection).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product acts as an intermediary HTTP agent\n         (such as a proxy or firewall) in the data flow between two\n         entities such as a client and server, but it does not\n         interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that\n         are consistent with how the messages will be processed by\n         those entities that are at the ultimate destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
