The guidance also says, \"CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\" The description provides enough detail to select the more specific CWE-78 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')], since the attacker can inject shell commands.\n\nCWE-78 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')] is a Base level of abstraction, which is preferred. The description matches, \"The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\"\n\nCWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the failure to properly neutralize special elements in user-supplied input when constructing OS commands. This allows for command injection and subsequent execution of arbitrary commands. The evidence from the vulnerability description and the CWE specifications strongly supports this classification.",
