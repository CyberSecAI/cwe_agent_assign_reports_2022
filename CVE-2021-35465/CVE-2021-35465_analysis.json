The security implication is that a Non-secure handler may have read or write access to part of a Secure context.\n\n**CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions**: This CWE was considered because the vulnerability description mentions that certain Arm products do not properly consider the effect of exceptions. However, this CWE is too high-level (Pillar) and does not accurately represent the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\n**CWE-270: Privilege Context Switching Error**: This CWE was considered because the impact of the vulnerability is that a Non-secure handler may have read or write access to part of a Secure context.
