While **information disclosure** is the high-level impact, this CWE is a class and should only be used if there is no more specific cause. |\n| CWE-618 | Exposed Unsafe ActiveX Method | 0.7 | Variant | Secondary | Allowed. This identifies the specific mechanism (ActiveX control) through which the information is exposed.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) and CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor). CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, and while it accurately reflects the **impact** of the vulnerability (**information disclosure**), it is often misused and should be avoided if a more specific root cause can be identified. The vulnerability involves an ActiveX control (CWE-618) being exploited to obtain NTLMv2 credentials, suggesting that the **sensitive information** is exposed through an **unsafe method** within the ActiveX control.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe618[\"CWE-618: Exposed Unsafe ActiveX Method\"]\n    cwe749[\"CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe618 -->|CHILDOF| cwe749\n    cwe618 --> cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe618 secondary\n    class cwe749,cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **unauthenticated attacker** leveraging a **maliciously crafted Microsoft Office file** or an **attacker-controlled web page**. This leads to the exploitation of an **unsafe ActiveX method** (CWE-618), resulting in the **exposure of NTLMv2 credentials** (**information disclosure**, CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **information disclosure impact**, which led to considering CWE-200. However, the evidence also points to a specific mechanism, namely the **exploitation of an ActiveX control**. This suggests that the vulnerability is more accurately represented by CWE-618 (Exposed Unsafe ActiveX Method), which describes situations where an ActiveX control exposes dangerous methods that perform actions outside of the browser's security model. While CWE-200 captures the high-level impact, CWE-618 better reflects the **root cause** by highlighting the specific vulnerability mechanism. I am including CWE-200 as the primary CWE because it captures the **impact** and is also the top hit from the Retriever results and similar CVEs. But I am including CWE-618 as a secondary CWE because it represents the specific mechanism. The overall confidence is medium because there is limited information about the exact **unsafe method** being exploited within the ActiveX control.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available.
