CWE-526, a variant of CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information), is related as the sensitive information is stored in an environment variable. CWE-212, where sensitive information is not properly removed before storage or transfer, also applies as the environment variables are being exposed to unintended processes. The relationships show that CWE-214 is the most direct cause, with CWE-526 and CWE-212 contributing factors or related conditions.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe214[\"CWE-214: Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe526[\"CWE-526: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in an Environment Variable\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Data\"]\n\n    cwe526 -->|CHILDOF| cwe312\n    cwe526 -- PEEROF --> cwe214\n    cwe212 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe214\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe214 primary\n    class cwe526,cwe212 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with sensitive information being present in environment variables. Buildah **fails to properly sanitize** these environment variables when using chroot isolation. Consequently, child processes can access these sensitive variables, leading to information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the analysis considered CWE-212 due to the failure to remove sensitive information. However, the core issue is that a process is being invoked (a container build) and is inheriting sensitive information that it should not have access to. This aligns more directly with CWE-214. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"The vulnerability is caused by Buildah **not properly sanitizing** the environment variables when using chroot isolation, allowing child processes to access sensitive data meant only for Buildah.\" This directly supports CWE-214 as the primary weakness because it is invoking the child process and making the variables available. CWE-526 is included because the sensitive data is in an environment variable. The evidence strongly supports selecting CWE-214 as the primary CWE due to the **invocation of a process using visible sensitive information** that should have been sanitized. The relationships within the CWE structure further solidify this selection, as CWE-214 is a base level weakness which is preferred, and it directly relates to the **invocation of a process** with the sensitive data.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere.
