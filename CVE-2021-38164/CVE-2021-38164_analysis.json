CWE-200 [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] is a class-level CWE which describes the impact of exposing sensitive information. CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] can lead to CWE-200 [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor].\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|RESULT OF| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing** authorization check (CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization]), which leads to the exposure of sensitive financial data (CWE-200 [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor]).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description states that a \"registered attacker can invoke certain functions that would otherwise be restricted to specific users.\" This indicates a **lack** of proper authorization checks, making CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nThe impact of this **missing** authorization is that the attacker \"may be able to view and modify financial accounting data that only a specific user should have access to,\" leading to the exposure of sensitive information. Therefore, CWE-200 [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] is considered a secondary CWE representing the impact of the primary weakness.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] is based on the evidence that the system **fails to** perform authorization checks, allowing unauthorized access to restricted functions. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization].\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] can lead to CWE-200 [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor], supporting the classification of CWE-200 [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] as a secondary CWE representing the impact.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity. While CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] is a Class-level CWE, it accurately represents the **missing** authorization check, and there isn't enough information to determine a more specific Base-level CWE. CWE-200 [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] is also a Class-level CWE representing the impact of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-668 [CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere] was considered, but ultimately deemed less appropriate than CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization]. While CWE-668 [CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere] also deals with exposure of resources, it is a higher-level CWE and less specific to the **missing** authorization check. The mapping guidance for CWE-668 [CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere] also discourages its use as a catch-all when lower-level CWEs might be applicable.\n\nCWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function] was also considered, but it focuses on **missing** authentication, whereas this vulnerability involves **missing** authorization after a user is already authenticated (\"registered attacker\").\n\nCWE-863 [CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization] was also considered, but the description states the functions are \"restricted to specific users.\" meaning it's not that the authorization is incorrect, but that the authorization is **missing** from the function.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:",
