# Analysis for CVE-2021-28168

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-379 | Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-378 | Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-379, which is a child of CWE-377 (Insecure Temporary File). While CWE-377 is a broader category, CWE-379 specifically addresses the issue of creating temporary files in directories with insecure permissions, which aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description. CWE-378 is also a child of CWE-377 but is more general, simply stating that temporary files are created with insecure permissions without specifying the directory as the source of the issue.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is as follows:
1.  The application uses `File.createTempFile` (**ROOT CAUSE**).
2.  This function creates a file in the system's temporary directory.
3.  The temporary file is created with insecure permissions (`-rw-r--r--`).
4.  Local users can read the contents of the temporary file.
5.  Sensitive data is exposed to other local users (**IMPACT**: Local information disclosure).

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary." The key evidence supporting CWE-379 is the description stating that the **rootcause** is the **use of `File.createTempFile`** which creates a file inside of the system temporary directory with the permissions `-rw-r--r--`. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" further confirms this by stating, "The vulnerability stems from the use of `File.createTempFile`, which generates files in the system's temporary directory with insecure permissions (`-rw-r--r--`). This allows other local users to read the contents of these temporary files."

CWE-379 is chosen because it accurately reflects the weakness: creating a temporary file in a directory with insecure permissions, leading to information disclosure. The other highly ranked CWEs, like CWE-378 (Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions) and CWE-377 (Insecure Temporary File), are less specific. CWE-379 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level. CWE-378 could also be considered since the vulnerability also creates a temporary file with insecure permissions, but it is secondary to CWE-379.

CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) was considered but deemed less suitable because the core issue is the creation of the temporary file with insecure permissions in a shared directory, rather than an explicit incorrect assignment of permissions to an existing resource.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.82
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.82
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as "/abs/path" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-24: Path Traversal: '../filedir'
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize "../" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product creates a temporary file in a directory whose permissions allow unintended actors to determine the file'
