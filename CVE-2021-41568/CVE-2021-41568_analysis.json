A more specific Base-level CWE, CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), was also considered and included as a secondary CWE. CWE-285 is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), a Pillar-level CWE which is too generic. CWE-639 is a child of CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-284.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe639 secondary\n    class cwe284,cwe863 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **authorization bypass** (**WEAKNESS**), which allows remote attackers to view bulletin boards and upload files (**IMPACT**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **authorization bypass** as the root cause, which aligns well with CWE-285 (Improper Authorization). The vulnerability description key phrases also highlight this weakness. The retriever results also suggest CWE-285, CWE-639 and other related CWEs.\n\nCWE-285 is chosen as the primary CWE because the description states that Tad Web is vulnerable to **authorization bypass**. This means that the system is either not performing authorization checks or performing them incorrectly, which aligns with CWE-285.\n\nCWE-639 is included as a secondary CWE because it provides more context. The description of CWE-639 specifies that the **authorization bypass** occurs through a user-controlled key. While the vulnerability description doesn't explicitly mention a user-controlled key, it's a plausible scenario and adds more specificity to the weakness.\n\nCWE-284 is too high-level and generic. The MITRE mapping guidance discourages its use and suggests using more specific descendants like CWE-862 or CWE-863. Both CWE-862 and CWE-863 are authorization related. Since the vulnerability description highlights **authorization bypass**, these CWEs are more relevant than the generic access control issues.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
