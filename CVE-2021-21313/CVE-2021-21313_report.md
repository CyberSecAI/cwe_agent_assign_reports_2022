## Description



## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-79, which is a Base level CWE. CWE-79 is related to other CWEs via parent-child and peer relationships. Specifically, it is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')), indicating it's a specific type of injection. It is a peer of CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)), suggesting that XSS can sometimes be related to CSRF attacks. The relationships confirm that CWE-79 is appropriately specific and well-placed within the CWE hierarchy for this vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper input sanitization** in the `/ajax/common.tabs.php` endpoint. This leads to a **cross-site scripting** vulnerability (CWE-79). An attacker can then inject malicious code via the `_target` and `id` parameters, potentially leading to stealing cookies, defacing the web page, redirecting users, or accessing sensitive data.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis of the vulnerability description, especially the key phrases and CVE reference, clearly points to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to **improper input sanitization**.

The vulnerability description states: "In GLPI before version 9.5.4, there is a vulnerability in the /ajax/common.tabs.php endpoint, indeed, at least two parameters _target and id are **not properly sanitized**."

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this: "The vulnerability stems from the `/ajax/common.tabs.php` endpoint in GLPI. The parameters `_target` and `id` are **not properly sanitized** before being used, which allows for the injection of malicious code."

The Retriever Results also strongly suggest CWE-79 as the primary candidate, with a high similarity score. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-79 is a specific type of injection (child of CWE-74) and can be related to CSRF attacks (peer of CWE-352).

Therefore, CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability. It is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) and aligns with the provided evidence and mapping guidance.

Relevant CWE Information:
# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

*Not Selected:* While this is a parent of CWE-79, CWE-79 is a better fit because it's more specific.

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* CWE-79 is broader and more descriptive of the overall issue.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* While input validation is related, CWE-79 directly addresses the XSS issue.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* CWE-79 is a better fit as it directly addresses the XSS vulnerability resulting from the lack of output neutralization.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* CWE-79 directly addresses the XSS issue.

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* While this is related, CWE-79 is more specific and directly addresses the XSS issue.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This doesn't directly apply as the vulnerability is about input sanitization leading to XSS, not authorization bypass.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* While the application relies on input, the core issue is lack of sanitization, making CWE-79 more appropriate.
