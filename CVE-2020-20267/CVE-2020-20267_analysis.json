Memory corruption due to invalid memory access leading to a denial of service aligns with the description of writing data past the end of a buffer. |\n| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. The vulnerability involves accessing memory outside the intended buffer, which falls under the general category of CWE-119. However, CWE-787 is more specific. |\n| CWE-823 | Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The memory corruption could be caused by using a pointer with an offset that points outside the valid memory range. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE, CWE-787 **(Out-of-bounds Write)**, is a child of CWE-119 **(Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer)**. This indicates a hierarchical relationship where CWE-787 is a more specific case of CWE-119. CWE-823 **(Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset)** is also a child of CWE-119 and can precede CWE-787 which means that using an out-of-range pointer offset can lead to an out-of-bounds write. Selecting CWE-787 as the primary CWE offers a more precise description of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe823[\"CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe823 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe823 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe823 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with memory corruption in the /nova/bin/resolver process, leading to **invalid memory access**, which results in an out-of-bounds write and finally causes a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards memory corruption leading to **invalid memory access** causing a denial of service. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms the root cause as \"Memory corruption in the /nova/bin/resolver process\" and the weakness as \"Memory corruption due to **invalid memory access**.\"\n\nThe retriever results indicated CWE-787 **(Out-of-bounds Write)**, CWE-476 **(NULL Pointer Dereference)**, and CWE-119 **(Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer)** as potential candidates.\n\nCWE-787 **(Out-of-bounds Write)** is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary explicitly mention memory corruption due to **invalid memory access**, which aligns with the concept of writing data past the end of a buffer. The \"**weakness:** **invalid memory access**\" phrase in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section supports this.\n\nCWE-119 **(Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer)** is considered as a secondary CWE because it is a broader category encompassing memory access issues. The mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nCWE-823 **(Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset)** is considered as a secondary CWE because the **invalid memory access** could be caused by using a pointer with an offset that points outside the valid memory range.\n\nCWE-476 **(NULL Pointer Dereference)** was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because the description focuses on memory corruption and **invalid memory access** rather than specifically mentioning null pointer dereference.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description and the relationships between the CWEs. CWE-787 **(Out-of-bounds Write)** is the most specific and appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n* CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n* CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n* CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset",
