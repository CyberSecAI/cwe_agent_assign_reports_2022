# Analysis for CVE-2020-22031

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-122 and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), indicating that heap-based buffer overflows are a specific type of out-of-bounds write. CWE-119 is a more general class, and while applicable, CWE-122 provides a more precise classification.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is straightforward: a **Heap-based Buffer Overflow** (CWE-122) leads to memory corruption, potentially enabling denial of service or arbitrary code execution. There are no other prerequisites mentioned, and the description focuses on the buffer overflow itself and its immediate consequences.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided evidence, which is clear and direct. The vulnerability is described as a **Heap-based Buffer Overflow** in `filter16_complex_low` in FFmpeg. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the root cause as a heap-buffer-overflow in the specified function.

The retriever results also list CWE-122, but also include other CWEs such as CWE-119, CWE-190, CWE-125 and CWE-193. While CWE-119 is related, it is discouraged to use. The description specifically mentions heap allocation, which suggests the allocation happens via malloc() and family of functions.

The selection of CWE-122 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the described vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
When converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-839: Numeric Range Comparison Without Minimum Check
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product checks a value to ensure that it is less than or equal to a maximum, but it does not also verify that the value is greater than or equal to the minimum.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation to determine how much memory to allocate, but an integer overflow can occur that causes less memory to be allocated than expected, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a named chain, which combines multiple weaknesses.



## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 6874.07

         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
