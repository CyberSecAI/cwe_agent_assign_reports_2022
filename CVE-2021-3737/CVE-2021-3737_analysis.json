It is child of CWE-834 (Excessive Iteration). The secondary CWE is CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), which is a Class level CWE. CWE-400 is a parent of CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling). CWE-835 can be a result of CWE-1322 (Use of Blocking Code in Single-threaded, Non-blocking Context). The selection of CWE-835 as primary is due to its direct match with the vulnerability description mentioning \"infinite loop\".\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe835[\"CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe1322[\"CWE-1322: Use of Blocking Code in Single-threaded, Non-blocking Context\"]\n    \n    cwe835 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe1322 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe835\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe835 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe834,cwe770,cwe1322 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improperly handled HTTP response** leading to an infinite loop which results in consuming CPU time, thus affecting system availability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause and impact of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an \"infinite loop,\" making CWE-835 a strong candidate. The retriever results also ranked CWE-835 as the top match. The description also says the CPU time is consumed, resulting in an impact to system availability, which makes CWE-400 a secondary candidate.\n\nThe evidence is strong, with the vulnerability description key phrases directly supporting the selection of CWE-835. The graph relationships further solidify this choice, as CWE-835 is a base-level CWE that accurately represents the weakness.\n\nCWE-444 (Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests) was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because the description focuses on the \"infinite loop\" caused by the **improperly handled HTTP response** rather than an inconsistency in interpreting the HTTP request. However, the root cause **improperly handled HTTP response** could have an inconsistency as the root cause, but that is not present in the description.\n\nCWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) was considered but not selected because the description explicitly states an infinite loop, making CWE-835 a better fit. Recursion is not mentioned.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was considered as a secondary CWE because the infinite loop leads to consuming CPU time, which is a resource consumption issue. However, CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE and is discouraged when more specific CWEs are available. The more specific CWE is the CWE-835.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-835 being a base-level CWE that directly matches the vulnerability description.\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## Vulnerability Description\nA flaw was found in python. An **improperly handled HTTP response** in the HTTP client code of python may allow a remote attacker, who controls the HTTP server, to make the client script enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU time. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **improperly handled HTTP response**\n- **impact:** infinite loop, consuming CPU time\n- **attacker:** remote attacker\n- **product:** python\n- **component:** HTTP client code\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 835 | Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.422 |\n| 2 | 444 | Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.320 |\n| 3 | 674 | Uncontrolled Recursion | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.313 |\n| 4 | 201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.311 |\n| 5 | 1333 | Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.305 |\n| 6 | 1050 | Excessive Platform Resource Consumption within a Loop | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.501 |\n| 7 | 1322 | Use of Blocking Code in Single-threaded, Non-blocking Context | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 93 | Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.300 |\n| 9 | 400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.299 |\n| 10 | 295 | Improper Certificate Validation | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.297 |\n\n### CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\n**Technical Explanation:** The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to cause the client script to enter an **infinite loop**. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-835, which defines a loop with an exit condition that cannot be reached.\n**Security Implications:** An infinite loop consumes CPU time, leading to a denial-of-service condition, affecting system availability.\n**Relationship Analysis:** CWE-835 is a Base-level CWE and is a child of CWE-834 (Excessive Iteration).\n**Mapping Guidance Influence:** The MITRE mapping guidance allows for the use of CWE-835 and its description fits the vulnerability.\n**Justification:** The evidence is the phrase \"infinite loop\" found in the vulnerability description, which directly matches the CWE-835 description.\n**Confidence:** 0.9\n\n### CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Technical Explanation:** The infinite loop consumes CPU time, which is a limited resource. This aligns with CWE-400, where the product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource (CPU), leading to resource exhaustion.\n**Security Implications:** Resource exhaustion leads to a denial-of-service condition, affecting system availability.\n**Relationship Analysis:** CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE.\n**Mapping Guidance Influence:** The MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-400 when more specific CWEs are available. In this case, CWE-835 is more specific.\n**Justification:** The evidence is the phrase \"consuming CPU time\" found in the vulnerability description.\n**Confidence:** 0.6",
