CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) and CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) are potential contributing factors that could lead to the heap overflow. CWE-131 and CWE-190 can **CanPrecede** CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) which is a parent of CWE-787. Choosing the **Variant** CWE-122 provided a more specific classification than its parents.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe131 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe119,cwe131,cwe190 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a potential **incorrect calculation of the buffer size** (CWE-131) or an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) that results in a smaller than expected buffer, which then leads to a **heap-based buffer overflow** (CWE-122) when data is written to the buffer.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **heap overflow** reported in the vulnerability description, leading to the selection of CWE-122. The retriever results also suggested other related CWEs, such as CWE-131 and CWE-190, which could be contributing factors to the root cause of the overflow. The final decision was to classify the vulnerability as CWE-122 because the description explicitly mentions a **heap overflow** and the retriever results identify it as a potential weakness. The vulnerability description identifies a **heap overflow** in the LzmaUefiDecompressGetInfo function in EDK II. \"A **heap overflow** in LzmaUefiDecompressGetInfo function in EDK II.\"\n\nCWE-122 is at the **Variant** level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound - Considered because an integer overflow could lead to a smaller buffer allocation than expected and contribute to the **heap overflow**. However, without more evidence, this is only a potential contributing factor.\n*   CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size - Considered because an incorrect calculation of the buffer size could cause the **heap overflow**. However, the description only mentions a **heap overflow**, so this is only a potential contributing factor.\n*   CWE-193: Off-by-one Error - Rejected because an off-by-one error is not explicitly stated or implied in the description.\n*   CWE-195: Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error - Rejected because a signed to unsigned conversion error is not explicitly stated or implied in the description.\n*   CWE-194: Unexpected Sign Extension - Rejected because an unexpected sign extension is not explicitly stated or implied in the description.\n*   CWE-409: Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification) - Rejected because improper handling of highly compressed data is not explicitly stated or implied in the description.\n*   CWE-128: Wrap-around Error - Rejected because a wrap-around error is not explicitly stated or implied in the description.\n*   CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types - Rejected because an incorrect conversion between numeric types is not explicitly stated or implied in the description.\n*   CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error - Rejected because numeric truncation error is not explicitly stated or implied in the description.\n*   CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') - Rejected because the description does not provide sufficient information on the root cause.\n*   CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write - Rejected because the **Variant** CWE-122 provides a more specific classification for the **heap overflow**.\n*   CWE-196: Unsigned to Signed Conversion Error - Rejected because an unsigned to signed conversion error is not explicitly stated or implied in the description.",
