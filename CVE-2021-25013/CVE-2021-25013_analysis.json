A secondary weakness is the **missing CSRF check**, which allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a user without their consent. CWE-862 is a class-level CWE, and a more specific base-level CWE might exist, but the description focuses on the complete absence of authorization. CWE-352 is a compound CWE representing a combination of weaknesses.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe352 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** and **missing CSRF check** on the `qubely_delete_saved_block` AJAX action. This leads to the impact of any authenticated user being able to **delete arbitrary posts**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis identified two key **weaknesses**: **missing authorization** and **missing CSRF check**. The primary CWE is CWE-862 because the description explicitly states that there is **no authorization** check on the AJAX action. CWE-352 is selected as a secondary CWE because there is also a **missing CSRF check**. Both weaknesses combined allow unauthorized users to delete arbitrary posts.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 and CWE-352 is directly supported by the vulnerability description, which highlights the **missing authorization** and **missing CSRF check**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or

uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n-
