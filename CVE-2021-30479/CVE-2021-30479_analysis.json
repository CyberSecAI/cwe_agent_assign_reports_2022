It has a ChildOf relationship with CWE-269. CWE-863 is a Class-level CWE with a ChildOf relationship with CWE-285 and CWE-284. While CWE-863 is relevant, CWE-267 is a better fit because it focuses on the unsafe actions associated with the privilege, while CWE-863 is a more general \"Incorrect Authorization\".\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe267[\"CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe267 -->|CHILDOF| cwe269\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe267 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Bug in the implementation of the all_public_streams API feature** (CWE not explicitly identified, but related to **Improper Privilege Management**)\n2.  **Weakness:** Guest users were granted a privilege that allowed unsafe actions, specifically accessing public streams that should be restricted to organization members (**CWE-267**).\n3.  **Impact:** Guest users could receive message traffic to public streams, gaining unauthorized information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **bug in the implementation of the all_public_streams API feature**, which led to guest users gaining unauthorized access. The evidence strongly supports this, quoting from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links: \"Guest users were able to access the `all_public_streams` API which was not intended for guest users\" and \"**bug in the implementation of the all_public_streams API feature** resulted in guest users being able to receive message traffic to public streams\".\n\nThe graph relationships helped refine the selection. While CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was a candidate, CWE-267 (Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions) is more specific to the situation. CWE-267 describes a scenario where a privilege exists but allows actions that are not intended, which matches the vulnerability where the guest user privilege allowed access to the `all_public_streams` API when it shouldn't have.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-267, is at the optimal level of specificity as it clearly identifies the core issue: a privilege, intended or not, allowed for unsafe actions (accessing restricted streams).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
