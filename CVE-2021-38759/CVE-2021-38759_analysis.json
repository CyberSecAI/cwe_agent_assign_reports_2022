The vulnerability stems from the Raspberry Pi OS using a **default password** for the \"pi\" account, which can be exploited to gain administrator privileges.\n\nCWE-1188 (Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default) captures the root cause where the system is initialized with a **default password** that's insecure.\n\nCWE-1393 (Use of Default Password) is a child of CWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials), which is a child of CWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials).

This leads to the **use of a default password (CWE-1393)**. If the **default password** is not changed, attackers can exploit this to gain administrator privileges, leading to potential system compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment indicated that the vulnerability is due to the Raspberry Pi OS using a **default password** for the \"pi\" account.\n\nThe retriever results and the vulnerability description key phrases both point to the **default password** as the weakness.\nThe graph relationships and abstraction levels influenced the final selection. CWE-1188 is selected as the primary CWE because it accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the insecure default configuration.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"Raspberry Pi OS through 5.10 has the raspberry **default password** for the pi account. If not changed, attackers can gain administrator privileges.\"\n\nCWE-1188 accurately represents the **root cause** because the Raspberry Pi OS is initialized with an insecure **default password**, which is intended to be changed by the administrator but often is not. This aligns perfectly with the CWE's description: \"The product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately describe the **root cause** and the specific type of weakness (use of a **default password**). While CWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials) is a broader class, CWE-1188, CWE-1393, CWE-798, and CWE-259 provide more specific details about the nature of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses default",
