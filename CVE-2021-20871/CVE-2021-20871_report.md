# Summary

| CWE ID  | CWE Name                                                        | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor    | 0.9        | Class                 | Primary                         | Discouraged                   |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-200 and CWE-668. Although CWE-200 is a Class level, it is the most descriptive CWE based on the evidence. There are many Base level CWEs that are children of CWE-200, but they are not suitable in this case.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of SOAP messages**, leading to the **exposure of sensitive information**, which results in unauthorized access to credentials.

## Summary of Analysis

The initial assessment considered CWE-200 as the primary candidate due to the **exposure of sensitive information**. The Retriever Results and the "CWE for similar CVE Descriptions" section both list CWE-200 as the primary match. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the root cause is the **improper handling of SOAP messages**, which leads to the **exposure of credentials**.

The final decision is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The description clearly indicates that the vulnerability results in the exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor, which aligns with the definition of CWE-200.

The mapping guidance for CWE-200 is "Discouraged" because it is often misused to represent the loss of confidentiality, which is a technical impact rather than a root cause. However, in this case, the **exposure of sensitive information** is a direct result of **improper handling of SOAP messages**, making CWE-200 an appropriate choice. The CWE selected is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately describes the vulnerability and its impact. Other CWEs considered were either too high-level or did not accurately reflect the nature of the vulnerability.

## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77

**Description**:
The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or "zeroize" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.

- Usage: Allowed

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77

**Description**:

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76

- Usage: Allowed

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.
