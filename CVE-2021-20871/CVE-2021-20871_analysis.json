Although CWE-200 is a Class level, it is the most descriptive CWE based on the evidence. There are many Base level CWEs that are children of CWE-200, but they are not suitable in this case.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of SOAP messages**, leading to the **exposure of sensitive information**, which results in unauthorized access to credentials.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment considered CWE-200 as the primary candidate due to the **exposure of sensitive information**. The Retriever Results and the \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section both list CWE-200 as the primary match. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the root cause is the **improper handling of SOAP messages**, which leads to the **exposure of credentials**.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The description clearly indicates that the vulnerability results in the exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor, which aligns with the definition of CWE-200.\n\nThe mapping guidance for CWE-200 is \"Discouraged\" because it is often misused to represent the loss of confidentiality, which is a technical impact rather than a root cause. However, in this case, the **exposure of sensitive information** is a direct result of **improper handling of SOAP messages**, making CWE-200 an appropriate choice. The CWE selected is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately describes the vulnerability and its impact. Other CWEs considered were either too high-level or did not accurately reflect the nature of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of

Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way
