While it's generally preferred to choose a Base or Variant level CWE, the evidence suggests that the core issue is a failure to perform an authorization check. CWE-425 (Direct Request) is a child of CWE-862, which was considered as a more specific Base CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    \n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect matching of requested URLs to the list of always accessible paths**. This leads to **missing authorization checks** and results in attackers gaining unauthorized access to certain URLs.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on the root cause of the vulnerability: the **failure to correctly match URLs against a list of always-accessible paths**. This **failure** leads to a **missing authorization check**, allowing unauthorized access.\n\nThe key evidence for this assessment comes from the following:\n\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** \"**does not correctly match requested URLs to the list of always accessible paths**\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"Jenkins does not correctly compare requested URLs with a static list of URLs that are always accessible even without Overall/Read permission.\"\n\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization) aligns with this root cause because it describes a situation where \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\" While CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, the provided evidence does not clearly indicate a more specific cause that would warrant choosing a Base or Variant CWE.\n\nCWE-425 (Direct Request) was considered because it is a child of CWE-862 and describes a scenario where \"The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\" While this is relevant, the primary issue is the **failure to perform the authorization check**, rather than the direct access itself.\n\nTherefore, CWE-862 is selected as the primary CWE because it accurately reflects the core weakness: the **missing authorization check** due to the incorrect URL matching.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names.
