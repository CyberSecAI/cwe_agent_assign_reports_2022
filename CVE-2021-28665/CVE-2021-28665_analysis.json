CWE-400 is a **Class** which represents a broader category of resource consumption issues, making CWE-401 a more specific fit. CWE-770, while related, focuses on allocation without limits, whereas the description indicates a failure to release memory after use, making CWE-401 more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe772[\"CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    \n    cwe401 -->|CHILDOF| cwe772\n    cwe401 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe401 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with a **memory-management defect** in the SNMP plugin. This **defect** leads to a **missing release of memory after its effective lifetime (CWE-401)**, resulting in excessive consumption of memory and CPU resources, ultimately causing a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is described as a **memory-management defect** leading to excessive resource consumption and denial of service. The description clearly indicates that the vulnerability involves a failure to properly manage memory, specifically related to the SNMP plugin in Stormshield SNS versions before 3.7.18, 3.11.6, and 4.1.6.\n\nThe selection of CWE-401 is based on the evidence that the product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory. This aligns directly with the vulnerability description, which mentions the **memory-management defect** and excessive consumption of resources. The mapping guidance for CWE-401 allows its usage and emphasizes that the CWE entry is at the **Variant** level of abstraction, which is a preferred level.\n\nCWE-400 and CWE-770 were considered as secondary options. CWE-400 is a **Class** that describes uncontrolled resource consumption, while CWE-770 focuses on allocation of resources without limits or throttling. While these are relevant, CWE-401 is a more precise mapping because it specifically addresses the **missing release of memory**, which is the core issue described in the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the **root cause** of the vulnerability (CWE-401) and its potential consequences (CWE-400, CWE-770).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or

is consumed by all of the combined objects.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**:

for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with
