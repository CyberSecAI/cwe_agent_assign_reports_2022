It is related to CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), CWE-923 (Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints), and CWE-183 (Permissive List of Allowed Inputs) through ChildOf relationships. The vulnerability description strongly aligns with the characteristics of CWE-942, indicating it is the most appropriate choice.\n\nCWE-1385 (Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets) is also a Variant, and a secondary candidate, related to CWE-346. Although websockets aren't explicitly mentioned, the description speaks to Cross-Origin Request issues so this CWE is a less specific, but related weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe942[\"CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe923[\"CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\"]\n    cwe183[\"CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs\"]\n    cwe346[\"CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\"]\n    cwe1385[\"CWE-1385: Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets\"]\n    \n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe923\n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe183\n    cwe1385 -->|CHILDOF| cwe346\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe942 primary\n    class cwe1385 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **insecure CORS configuration**, leading to the **acceptance of cross-origin requests from any origin**. This allows an attacker to potentially **access sensitive data** or **manipulate configurations** if the user has an active session.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis indicated CWE-942 as the primary candidate, which aligns with the **weakness** of allowing cross-origin requests with credentials from any origin. This assessment is strongly supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\n\n> Root Cause of Vulnerability:\n>\n> *   The vulnerability stems from an overly broad Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration in Apache Kylin. Specifically, the server reflects the `Origin` header in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header, allowing any origin to make cross-origin requests.\n\nThe relationship analysis further solidified this choice, as CWE-942 is a Variant-level CWE that directly addresses permissive cross-domain policies. The retriever results also listed CWE-942 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-1385 was considered because the summary mentions request origin validation.\n\n> **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n>\n> *   **Insecure CORS Configuration:** The server dynamically reflects the `Origin` header value in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response, effectively allowing any website to make cross-origin requests to the Kylin API. This bypasses the intended security of the CORS policy.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-942 being a Variant that accurately reflects the vulnerability's root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 7198.56\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a cross-domain policy file that includes domains that should not be trusted.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1385: Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 6699.16\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a WebSocket, but it does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
