This aligns well with the vulnerability description's mention of a **race condition** involving a symbolic link. CWE-367 is a child of CWE-362 (Race Condition), which represents a broader class of concurrency issues. CWE-363 (Race Condition Enabling Link Following) is a child of CWE-367 and can precede CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution). CWE-59 is a **Base** level weakness that describes the improper handling of symbolic links, which is also present in the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe363[\"CWE-363: Race Condition Enabling Link Following\"]\n    \n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe363 -->|CHILDOF| cwe367\n    cwe363 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe59\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe367 primary\n    class cwe59,cwe362,cwe363 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a **race condition** (CWE-367) in the handling of symbolic links, potentially leading to the ability to access sensitive information. The chain starts with the **race condition**, followed by the improper resolution of the symbolic link (CWE-59), which can lead to information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the presence of a **race condition** and symbolic link handling issues. The final assessment concludes that CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use Race Condition) is the most appropriate primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **race condition** involving symbolic links. This is further supported by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states that the root cause is a **race condition** in how IBM Db2 handles symbolic links. CWE-59 is a closely related secondary CWE, because the **race condition** makes it possible to exploit the symbolic link handling vulnerability. CWE-362 is a more general class of **race condition**, so it is less specific than CWE-367.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
