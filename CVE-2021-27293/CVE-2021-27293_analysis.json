CWE-185 (Incorrect Regular Expression) is considered as a related Class-level CWE. The vulnerability involves an inefficient regular expression leading to denial of service.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    cwe185[\"CWE-185: Incorrect Regular Expression\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe1333 -->|PEEROF| cwe185\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe407,cwe185 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **regular expression DoS vulnerability** due to a poorly written regular expression. This leads to excessive CPU consumption, ultimately resulting in a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **rootcause**, which is a **regular expression DoS vulnerability**. The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" clearly states: \"The vulnerability is due to a poorly written regular expression `NewDateRegex` in the `RestSharp.Extensions.StringExtensions` class. The regex `new Regex(@\\\"newDate\\\\((-?\\\\d+)*\\\\)\\\")` contains nested repeats which can lead to catastrophic backtracking.\" This aligns well with CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity), which describes a regular expression with an inefficient computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-1333 as the top candidate with a high score. The description of CWE-1333 mentions \"backtracking\" and \"crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike,\" which directly corresponds to the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-185 (Incorrect Regular Expression) was considered because the vulnerability involves a poorly written regular expression. However, CWE-1333 is more specific because it addresses the complexity aspect, which is the **rootcause** of the denial of service.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1333 is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the retriever results. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-1333 is a child of CWE-407, indicating that it is a more specific type of algorithmic complexity issue. The mapping guidance for CWE-1333 allows its use and emphasizes that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression that does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-185: Incorrect Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product specifies a regular expression in a way that causes data to be improperly matched or compared.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-777: Regular Expression without Anchors\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression to perform neutralization, but the regular expression is not anchored and may allow malicious or malformed data to slip through.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-186: Overly Restrictive Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA regular expression is overly restrictive, which prevents dangerous values from being detected.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
