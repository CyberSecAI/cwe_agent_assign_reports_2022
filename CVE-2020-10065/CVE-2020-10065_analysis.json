The retriever results also list it as the top candidate. CWE-130 is related to out-of-bounds read/write issues, as an inconsistent length parameter can lead to accessing memory outside the intended buffer. This is reflected in the `CanPrecede` relationship to CWE-805 [Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value], which can then lead to CWE-787 [Out-of-bounds Write] or CWE-125 [Out-of-bounds Read].\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe130[\"CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\"]\n    cwe805[\"CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n\n    cwe130 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe805\n    cwe805 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe787\n    cwe805 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe125\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe130 primary\n    class cwe805,cwe787,cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency** (CWE-130), which leads to **Out-of-bounds Write** (CWE-787) or **Out-of-bounds Read** (CWE-125) when the program attempts to access memory locations beyond the allocated buffer due to the incorrect length.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-130 [Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency] as the primary **rootcause**, supported by the explicit mention in the vulnerability description and the Retriever results. The subsequent analysis considered the downstream effects of this weakness, leading to the inclusion of CWE-787 [Out-of-bounds Write] or CWE-125 [Out-of-bounds Read] as secondary CWEs, representing the potential impacts of the vulnerability.\n\nThe primary decision is based on the following evidence: \"Zephyr versions >= v1.14.2, >= v2.2.0 contain **Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency** (CWE-130).\"\n\nThe graph relationships helped to solidify the understanding of how the initial weakness (CWE-130) can lead to out-of-bounds access (CWE-787 or CWE-125). The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the **rootcause** and potential impacts of the vulnerability, while also aligning with the recommended abstraction levels (Base and Variant).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-476:
