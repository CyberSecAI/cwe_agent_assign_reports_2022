CWE-285 is a child of CWE-284 and represents a slightly more specific Class-level weakness related to authorization. CWE-863 is a child of both CWE-285 and CWE-284, representing an even more specific Class-level weakness focused on incorrect authorization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Access Control** (CWE-284), which leads to an application denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the root cause is **Improper Access Control**: \"AEMs Cloud Service offering, as well as versions 6.5.7.0 (and below), 6.4.8.3 (and below) and 6.3.3.8 (and below) are affected by an **Improper Access Control** vulnerability.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this: \"Root cause of vulnerability: Improper Access control\".\n\nGiven this evidence, CWE-284 is selected as the primary CWE. However, the mapping guidance for CWE-284 discourages its use because it's a high-level Pillar. It suggests using more specific descendants related to authorization. Therefore, CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) are considered as secondary CWEs.\n\nCWE-284 is selected as the primary weakness because it's the most direct representation of the stated root cause. The retriever results also list CWE-284 as the top combined result.\n\nCWE-285 is considered a secondary candidate as it is more specific than CWE-284, focusing on authorization issues.\n\nCWE-863 is considered a tertiary candidate since it is even more specific focusing on authorization, but the description doesn't provide enough information to determine if authorization was performed incorrectly.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity given the available information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
