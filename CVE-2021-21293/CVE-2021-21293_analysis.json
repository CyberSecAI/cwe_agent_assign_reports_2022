This hierarchy suggests a progression from a general resource consumption issue (CWE-400) to a more specific problem of allocating resources without limits (CWE-770), and finally to the most specific case of file descriptors or handles (CWE-774). Choosing CWE-774 provides the most precise classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe774[\"CWE-774: Allocation of File Descriptors or Handles Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe774 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe774 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n    class cwe400 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **unbounded connection acceptance**, leading to an **allocation of file descriptors without limits**, ultimately resulting in **file handle exhaustion**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE mapping is CWE-774 because the vulnerability specifically involves the **allocation of file descriptors without limits or throttling**, which directly leads to **file handle exhaustion**. This is supported by the vulnerability description mentioning \"Each connection allocates a socket handle, which drains a scarce OS resource\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary stating \"The `blaze-core` library accepts connections without limit on its selector pool...consuming OS resources (socket handles)\".\n\nThe description explicitly states \"**unbounded connection acceptance** leads to **file handle exhaustion**\". This phrase strongly suggests CWE-774, which focuses on the allocation of file descriptors without limits. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also corroborates this by stating that the root cause is the library accepting connections without limit, leading to consumption of socket handles.\n\nCWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) was considered as a more general alternative, since file descriptors are a type of resource, but CWE-774 is more specific and therefore more appropriate.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was also considered, but it's a higher-level class that doesn't pinpoint the exact weakness, making it less suitable than CWE-774 and CWE-770. Also, CWE-400 is discouraged.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately reflect the **root cause** (unlimited file descriptor allocation) and the resulting **weakness** (file handle exhaustion). The analysis relies heavily on the vulnerability description's key phrases and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, providing direct evidence for the selected CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
