It sits under CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**) and CWE-284 (**Improper Access Control**). The vulnerability involves the program performing authorization checks but doing them incorrectly. CWE-200 (**Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**) can be an impact of this **incorrect authorization**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control**, which leads to **incorrect authorization**, ultimately resulting in the exposure of sensitive project access token names.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper Access Control**\n  - **Weakness:** **Incorrect Authorization** in GraphQL API\n  - **Impact:** Exposure of project access token names on arbitrary projects\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **Improper access control** as the root cause. The retriever results and the provided information support the selection of CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) as the primary CWE because the system attempts to perform authorization but does so incorrectly. The CVE reference summary also highlights that project access tokens names were publicly viewable. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that the **improper access control** allows an attacker to see the names of project access tokens. This leads to the exposure of sensitive information, making CWE-200 (**Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**) a secondary concern.\n\nI am choosing CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) because the **improper access control** led to the authorization check failing. I am choosing CWE-200 (**Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**) as a secondary concern because the **incorrect authorization** led to exposure of sensitive project access token names.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n\n\n## CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly limit the number or frequency of interactions that it has with an actor, such as the number of incoming requests.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
