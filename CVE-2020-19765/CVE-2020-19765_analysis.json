It does not have any parent-child relationships that are relevant in this context. It has a peer relationship with CWE-1265 (Base) which describes \"Unintended Reentrant Invocation of Non-reentrant Code Via Nested Calls\".\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe663[\"CWE-663: Use of a Non-reentrant Function in a Concurrent Context\"]\n    cwe1265[\"CWE-1265: Unintended Reentrant Invocation of Non-reentrant Code Via Nested Calls\"]\n    cwe691[\"CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\"]\n    \n    cwe1265 -->|CHILDOF| cwe691\n    cwe1265 --|PEEROF| cwe663\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe663 primary\n    class cwe1265 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the **improper** use of the noReentrance() modifier, leading to a **reentrancy** attack. The root cause is that the `_in` variable, intended for reentrancy protection, is declared as `internal` instead of `private`, allowing malicious contracts to bypass this protection. This leads to the ability to carry out a **reentrancy** attack.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly suggests CWE-663 as the primary weakness, which is supported by the evidence provided. The **root cause** is the **improper** use of a non-reentrant function in a concurrent context, specifically the noReentrance() modifier within the Ethereum contract. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **reentrancy** attack. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **weakness** is due to insufficient access control on the `_in` variable, allowing bypass of reentrancy protection.\n\nThe selection of CWE-663 is further justified by its Base abstraction level, which aligns with MITRE's preferred level for mapping to root causes. The usage is \"Allowed\" according to MITRE's mapping guidance.\n\nCWE-1265 was considered because it's a peer of CWE-663 and describes a scenario where non-reentrant code is unintentionally re-entered. However, it is less fitting because the core issue isn't about unintended nested calls, but rather the **improper** access control that allows the bypass of the reentrancy protection mechanism in the first place.\n\nThe analysis is heavily based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\" The evidence confirms that the **reentrancy** vulnerability stems from the **improper** use of the noReentrance() modifier, which aligns with CWE-663.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
