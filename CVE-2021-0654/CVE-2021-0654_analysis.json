While these parent CWEs are more general, CWE-862 directly addresses the specific weakness described in the vulnerability, which is a **missing permission check**. The abstraction level of Class also led me to consider potential Base-level children of CWE-862, but none were a more precise fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively straightforward:\n1.  The root cause is a **missing permission check** in `isRealSnapshot` function.\n2.  This **missing permission check** leads to local information disclosure from locked profiles.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nMy analysis is based directly on the provided evidence, which explicitly states \"**missing permission check**\" as the root cause. This aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-862, which is \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\" The vulnerability allows local information disclosure, which is a direct consequence of the **missing authorization**.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-862 as the top candidate. The confidence in this mapping is high (1.0) because the evidence directly supports the classification, and the CWE's description matches the vulnerability's root cause.\n\nCWE-667 (Improper Locking), CWE-665 (Improper Initialization), CWE-927 (Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication), and CWE-1021 (Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames) were considered but ultimately rejected. None of these CWEs accurately reflect the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **missing authorization check**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.418\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.345\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.344\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-927: Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.340\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe Android application uses an implicit intent for transmitting sensitive data to other applications.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1021: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.334\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not restrict or incorrectly restricts frame objects or UI layers that belong to another application or domain, which can lead to user confusion about which interface the user is interacting with.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
